Their Speech at the Inauguration Ceremony,2023-06-03,"

Dear Nation, Dear Heads of State and Government,
Dear Parliament Speakers,
Vice Presidents,
Dear Country Representatives, My Dear Friends from Home and Abroad,
Ladies, Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I am very pleased to host you on the occasion of this historic ceremony, at the Presidential Complex, in the home of the nation, in this place that was honored with veteran status on the night of July 15. I would like to thank each and every one of you for attending our ceremony.
At the very beginning of my words, I thank God for giving us the opportunity to serve Turkey and the Turkish nation for another 5 years. I would like to express my gratitude to every member of my beloved nation who made this possible with their votes, support and favor. I would like to thank each and every one of the 27 million 835 thousand brothers and sisters who once again deemed us worthy of the Office of the President.
I congratulate all my citizens who strengthen the power of our democracy by going to the polls, even though their will is manifested in different directions. I would especially like to congratulate our expatriates abroad who fulfill their civic duties towards their homeland by traveling for kilometers and sometimes waiting in line for hours. I would like to express my respect once again to our earthquake victims, who experienced the disaster of the century on February 6th, who stood by their will even though they were subjected to countless insults in the last two weeks, just because of their voting choices.
In these elections, we received the support not only of our own people living at home and abroad. At the same time, we received the prayers of hundreds of millions of oppressed and sad hearts all over the world who pinned their hopes on our country. I would especially like to express my gratitude to all my brothers and sisters whose eyes shine and shed tears when we hear the mention of Turkey, who rejoice and feel sad with us. I would like to thank the heads of state and government who called and shared our joy following the elections.
We will never forget the support of those who stood by us throughout this process. We will not forget the magnificent flood of love that overflowed into the streets of our country and throughout our heartland, from Africa to Asia, on the night of May 28. Along with all this, we will not forget the attempts to interfere with the national will through magazine covers. We will personally try to do justice to this great love for Turkey in the best way possible. I pray that God does not embarrass us to our nation and our friends.
My Dear Nation, Dear Friends,
Türkiye successfully passed one of the most critical elections in its political history. Thank God, we, as the People's Alliance, successfully completed the Parliamentary aspect of the elections on May 14 with 323 deputies. However, the Presidential election was postponed to the second round due to the requirement of 50+1 percent in the first round, even though we had a lead over our opponent. On May 28, our nation went to the polls again to complete the work it left unfinished with a vote rate of 0.50. Our participation rate in the first round elections exceeded 87 percent, and in the second round we again reached a record participation level of 85 percent. We had the honor of serving Turkey and the Turkish nation for 5 more years as President, with 52.18 percent of the votes in the May 28 elections, in which our nation flocked to the ballot boxes. I hope that this sublime mission will be beneficial to my nation, for whom I devoted my life, to every part of our heartland, and to humanity.
I hope we will not disappoint our dear nation's trust in us, our party and our alliance. We will continue to produce works and services for Türkiye, saying that those who work hard never get tired. We will embrace all 85 million people, regardless of their political views, origins, dispositions and sects. We have always maintained this sensitivity during our 21-year rule. While providing services, we did not consider anyone's beliefs or color of the game. We have never practiced regionalism, partisanship or discrimination. Like Sheikh Edebali, we said, ""Let the people live so that the state can live."" Like Yunus Emre, we said, ""We love creation because of the Creator."" Like Ahmed-i Hani, we said, ""Human is the embroidery drawn by the greatest pen."" Today, we follow the same light of wisdom. Today, we defend the same ideals and the same principles. Today, we call out to all of Turkey with the love language of Hacı Bektaşi, Yunus Emre, Pir Sultan, Mevlana and Ahmed-i Hani. We act with an understanding that glorifies conversation, tolerance, brotherhood and embracing, rather than emphasizing hatred, anger and hostility. We say, ""Come dear ones, let's be one, let's love, let's be loved."" I wholeheartedly believe that this sincere call will find echo in all 85 million people, with all its colors, riches and differences.
Turkey needs the energy, contribution and idea of ​​every citizen. Turkey's 85 million people need to be interlocked like bricks in a wall. Turkey needs unity and solidarity more than ever. As a nation, we need to re-establish this strong unity.
Dear Friends,
Here I would like to underline once again that; The election period has now ended as of the night of May 28. The national will was manifested twice at the ballot box, and the nation made its final decision. Turkey has now entered a new path with the closing of the ballot boxes and the announcement of the results. With God's permission, the Turkish century has begun and the doors of our country's revival period have opened. Hopefully, I will announce our new cabinet this evening and we will continue to embroider Turkey's century with our new cabinet. Hopefully we will hold our first cabinet meeting on Tuesday without delay.
Sticking to the election agenda means causing Turkey to skid. Constantly going through old books like a bankrupt merchant is of no benefit to the country or the nation. We must all look ahead together, focus on the future, and struggle to say new things. We must strive to build the future by learning from the past and past mistakes.
We have a tradition that does internal accounting after elections and manages to renew and update itself. We have come to this day by eliminating our shortcomings, correcting our mistakes, and further strengthening our strengths. We opened a new page after each election. We did not seek rematch or showdown. Even though we were treated unfairly, we were not among those who accepted the truth. Even though we were exposed to lies and slander, we never deviated from justice. We spoke with the language of conversation, both to our own voters and to those who did not vote for us. Along with our victories, we also increased our humility. However, we have not seen such an attitude from the opposition in any of the 17 elections we won with an overwhelming majority. Our biggest problem is; The reason is that there is no truly vigorous opposition at this point in our country. Unfortunately, they were not willing to abandon their old habits. They pursued their own petty interests instead of the interests of the nation. Rather than making sincere self-criticism, they always looked for mistakes, flaws, and the reason for their failures in the citizens. After almost every election, the hand we extended for peace was always greeted with clenched fists. We hope they will take a different attitude this time. We expect the opposition to act with a sense of responsibility for the well-being of Turkey and Turkish democracy.
We want the entire opposition wing, including its journalists, writers, civil society and artists, to make peace with the national will. We believe that Turkey needs a big hug in this year when we are excited to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our Republic. From here, I invite all my citizens, districts, villages and households to start a brotherhood mobilization in all our 81 provinces. The day is the day of being one, being together, and strengthening our thousand-year-old brotherhood. Today is the day for our children to claim a bright future. Let's put aside the resentments and anger during the election period. Let's look for ways to make peace if there is resentment and hearts are broken. Let's all contribute to the construction of Türkiye's century. Let's celebrate the 100th anniversary of our Republic together, in accordance with its glory, spirit and meaning, as 85 million people. I have no doubt that we will achieve this, hopefully, in cooperation and unity of heart. I would like to thank all my citizens who accepted our invitation in advance.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Guests,
Of course, the election results of May 14 and May 28 have many meanings. Our nation once again claimed its democratic achievements and told us there is no stopping, keep going, keep working. Of course, it is not enough, he said, continue to produce services and works. Attempts to cast a shadow over the national will failed, and our nation once again rejected mandate and protection offers, just like a century ago. The politics of work and service has won over populism, and it has become clear again that the foresight and foresight of our people should not be underestimated. Turkish democracy, which has been damaged by repeated coups almost every 10 years since 1950, has once again proven its maturity to the whole world. It has been seen that the slanders of dictatorship and autocracy made by those who could not get even half of the voters to the ballot box were completely empty. With these elections, we not only foiled the campaigns that have been carried out against our country for decades, but also secured our future.
Again, in these elections, we saw that our proposal for Türkiye's century was accepted by our people. Our nation, which completed its national struggle a century ago with the establishment of the Republic, will crown the second century of the Republic with the Turkish century. We will implement this vision step by step over the next 5 years. We will follow up on all the promises we made to our people in the election arenas. I hope we will turn what we have promised into reality, one by one, as we have for the last 21 years. We will strengthen our democracy with a libertarian, civil and encompassing constitution by saving it from the current constitution that is the product of a coup. We will continue to grow our country through investment, employment, production, exports and current account surplus.
We are determined to put Gazi Mustafa Kemal's principle of ""Peace at home, peace in the world"" into practice in its true sense. We will do this not by turning inward and watching events from the stands, but by further expanding the sphere of influence of our entrepreneurial and humanitarian diplomacy. As a President who has been honored with the favor of his nation twice, our hand in defending Turkey's interests has now become stronger. From now on, we will see a Turkey whose international public opinion takes more initiative in resolving global crises, strives more to establish peace and stability in its region, rushes more for the development of the Turkish and Islamic world, and protects the oppressed and victimized more.
In the new era, our interlocutors will encounter a Turkey that fights more determinedly against terrorist organizations within and outside its borders, protects the rights of itself and its brothers in the blue homeland more strongly, raises the bar of success from economy to trade, from security to democracy, in short, a more determined, braver, more compassionate and more active Turkey in every field. will find it. We promise to work with all our strength to protect the glory and honor of the Republic of Turkey, to increase its reputation, and to glorify its name all over the world for the next 5 years.
We undertake to protect the existence of our state, the integrity of our homeland, and the unconditional sovereignty of our nation on every ground. With the belief that effort is ours, tawfik is from Allah, from today onwards we say Bismillah for the construction of the Turkish century.
Hopefully, we will be on our way this evening by announcing our new cabinet. I pray that God will open our path and our fortune. With these thoughts, I would like to welcome the President of Venezuela, who is among us from the other end of the world, on behalf of my nation. Likewise, I would like to welcome back my dear brother, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. Likewise, I welcome my brother Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Uzbekistan. Of course, on this occasion, I would like to thank the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Ersin Bey, and the Prime Minister. Again, I would like to thank the President of Kazakhstan, one of the Turkish republics, in your presence.
The number of heads of state is high, if we try to count them one by one right now, we will probably have to renew the conversation. I would also like to thank the heads of state and presidents of Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, my brother Prime Minister of Pakistan, and especially NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. And with all this, I would very much like to count the names until the end, we probably have some time constraints for this, but we will be together for dinner tonight and we will develop and expand our special conversation during dinner.
Of course, I would like to thank Mr. Devlet, who carried out this struggle together with the People's Alliance during this process, on behalf of myself and all my friends. Likewise, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Re-Welfare Party, with whom we continued this struggle throughout this process, the Chairman of HUDA PAR, and Mr. Önder, with whom we walked together throughout this process. Again, I would like to thank especially Mr. Chairman, who continued our journey with us and with whom we almost reached an end in this process. I guess we have forgotten something... I would like to thank Mr. Mustafa Destici. I would like to thank Mr. Sinan again.
Among those who are among us as presidents, the President of Bulgaria, Mr. Radev, is among us, and I would like to thank him as well. I would like to thank my dear friend Ali Bongo, President of Gabon. Likewise, I would like to thank the President of the Republic of Guinea, Mamady Doumbou. I would like to thank Guinea-Bissau President Omer Sissoco. I would like to thank Montenegrin President Jakov Milatovic. I mentioned my brother Tokayev, the President of Kazakhstan. I would especially like to thank President of Kyrgyzstan Chaparov. I would also like to thank Congolese President Denis Sassou N'Guesso. I would like to thank the President of Kosovo, Mr. Osmani. I would like to thank President Pendarovski of North Macedonia. I would like to thank Rwandan President Paul Kagame. I would like to thank Hasan Sheikh Mahmud, President of the Federal Republic of Somalia. I would like to thank Togolese President Gnassingbe.
We mentioned Venezuela, we mentioned Turkmenistan. Apart from this, there are vice presidents, I would like to thank all of them very much, especially on behalf of myself and my nation.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank once again each of my citizens, each member of the 85 million-strong Turkish family, who went to the polls and made our country experience a feast of democracy with their free will.
On this occasion, I would like to thank our former President Abdullah Gül Bey, to whom we are successor and successor.
Thank you, bless you.

",2023-05-28,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won the election between 2 candidates.,after
Their Speech at the Social Complex After the Election,2023-05-28,"

We love Turkey very much. Isn't this nation loved? We love. Those in Qandil don't like it, their extensions don't like it, but we do. Here is the current painting, the painting of lovers. The official figure is 320 thousand people are here now. I'm not talking about the roads, the roads from the airport to here were jam-packed.
You did not embarrass the People's Alliance, you did not leave the People's Alliance alone on this path, we walked this path together, we walked day and night, and you gave us this duty again. Hopefully, we continue to build and revive the Turkish century together. Are we ready for this?
My dear nation,
My Dear Citizens Who Watch Us on Their Screens,
Dear Ankara residents,
My Dear Cause and Travel Friends,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. Thank God, the second round of the Presidential election was completed without any significant problems or problems. According to the unofficial results of the election, our nation has entrusted us with the Presidency for another 5 years. I would like to express my gratitude to every member of my nation who once again deemed us worthy of the responsibility of governing the country.
I would like to thank every citizen who proved the power of our democracy by going to the polls at home and abroad, regardless of which party or candidate they voted for, both on May 14 and May 28. I congratulate the public personnel, party representatives, ballot box officials, observers, police officers and everyone else who worked to ensure that the election ran in the healthiest way during this process.
In one of the most important elections of our multi-party political life, our nation used its decision in favor of the Turkish century. In the first round of the election, our nation had already demonstrated its legislative preference by giving the majority of the members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to the People's Alliance. With the second round of elections held today, our nation's choice in the Presidency, that is, in the executive branch, has been finalized. This result, like every will of our nation, has a place in our hearts. But we are not the only winners, the winner is Turkey. The winner is our nation itself, with all its segments. The winner is our democracy.
If you remember, we said at every opportunity that when we win, no one in our country will lose. Likewise, we said that when we win, the only losers will be the owners of dirty scenarios about our country and their apparatus, terrorist organizations and loan sharks. Now we make the same promise once again; Today, no one lost, all 85 million won. As required by the responsibility given to us by our nation, we are not angry, resentful, angry or upset with anyone. Now is the time to unite and integrate around our national goals and national dreams, leaving aside all the debates and conflicts regarding the election period. We make this call with all our heart, not just for words. Because we know that Turkey's power comes from 85 million people being together.
Now, I am not an accounting expert, but I think there is something wrong in the accounting expert's calculation. In 2018, the number of CHP deputies was 146. We are doing the calculations, the number of deputies will be 169 in 2023, as you can see, there is an increase. But there are hired attorneys here, 40 hired attorneys. What did he do to the parties that received 1 percent of the votes? He gave 40 MPs for hire. Where did the number fall? to 129. From 146 to 129, which is bigger? I guess you can't say that 129 is greater than 129. I guess you can't say goodbye to those who reduce the number of MPs from 146 to 129. Now, with the people in Qandil, you can take them behind and shoot a video and say come on, but this nation does not and did not swallow, 17 MPs have fallen.
My brothers, what was he saying? He was saying, ""If you want to take Selo out, you will vote for me."" What did my beloved nation say? Because my nation knows very well that this terrorist who caused the death of 51 of our Kurdish brothers in Diyarbakır is Selo. In Turkey, where justice, rights and law prevail, you cannot take Selo, who caused the death of 51 of our Kurdish brothers, out as you wish. It is impossible for such a thing to happen, especially in our government. Because in our government, justice is the basis of property, this cannot be changed.
Behind all the troubles we have experienced since 1950, when the late Menderes opened the doors of a new era by saying ""Enough, the word belongs to the nation"", there is always the weakening of Turkey's power. This is why coups were made, this is why memorandums were issued, this is why coalitions were established and collapsed for this reason. Our differences in origin and temperament, which are our wealth, have been tried to be turned into reasons for separation. This is why the realization of the enormous economic potential we have has always been prevented. The areas of power and influence in the east, south, north and west of our country have always been covered up for this reason. The fear of those who straitjacketed us and suffocated us for years in tight-fitting straitjackets is that the Turkish century we herald today will one day arrive at their doorstep. Today is that day. You are here today for him.
Today is the day when our moves for democracy and development, for which the late Menderes gave his life, reach the highest level. Today is the start of the process of turning the great Turkey dream that the late Özal pursued until his last breath into reality. Today is the day when all men of the nation, from the late Erbakan to the late Türkeş, who are devoted to their cause with love, achieve the goal of their struggle. Today is the day to give the good news of Turkey's century, based on the works we have brought to our country and the services we have provided to our nation for 21 years. This is what we do with you, we did it with you.
Today is the day when the prayers of victory and gratitude of both our own citizens and our friends and brothers who see their future with us reach the throne. Here the polls are closed, the telephone chains have started to flow. From the Gulf to England and Russia, they all expressed their congratulations and we see that these congratulations will continue tomorrow.
All the traps laid in front of Turkey in the last 10 years, all the games played on it, all the daggers stuck in its back, all the obstacles in its feet were to prevent this day. Didn't the German magazines, the French magazines, the British magazines publish covers to destroy Erdoğan, and didn't they write these covers? My brothers, they lost too.
You have seen the alliances that have been formed against us for months, you have seen who is with whom. You have seen who stands against us, from terrorist organizations to perverted movements. You have seen the dirty games being played. However, what happened? Thank God they failed, and I hope they will not succeed from now on either. Because this nation has proven over and over again how strong its yeast is and how strong its foresight and foresight are in every crisis it has experienced. And that's why those who try to catch and find the weakness of the Turkish nation will lose again. Just what we have witnessed during these last elections has shown the honorable stance of our nation. As long as the bridge of love between us and our nation is this strong, there is no struggle we cannot overcome, no problem we cannot solve, no issue we cannot resolve, with God's permission. Now I thank my Lord for giving birth to me as a child of such a nation.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Now that the elections are over, we will devote all our time and energy to working, producing works and providing services. Healing the wounds of the February 6 earthquakes, the disaster of the century, rebuilding our destroyed cities, and connecting our people to life will continue to be at the top of our priorities. Not only our hearts, but also our hands will always continue to be on the earthquake zone.
Solving the problems arising from price increases caused by inflation and compensating for welfare losses are the most urgent topics of the coming days. It is not a difficult thing for us to solve these. Aren't we the ones who proved these by reducing the interest rate to 4.6 and the inflation to 6.2 during my term as Prime Minister? We have experienced and done this job, but do they have such a problem? No. Let these be just talk. If we do it, we will do it again. Yes, currently the interest rate has been reduced to 8.5% and you will see inflation, it will also decrease. They can't compete with us. They guard the door of the IMF.
My brothers,
Do you know how we started our break from Davos? In Davos, Babacan was with me at that time and we are meeting with the IMF President in Davos. Then we owe 23.5 billion dollars to the IMF. I said to the IMF President; Do you receive your installments? I'm buying. Therefore, you cannot intervene in Turkey's political destiny, I am the Prime Minister of Turkey. You will only receive your installments. What happened? We continued until 2013, we paid the last installment in 2013, after that our relationship with the IMF ended; this is us. But what was this CHP saying? You need to borrow from the IMF. That's your business, not ours. And look, 10 years have passed since that day, we did not borrow from the IMF. And at that time, our Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves were 27.5 billion dollars. What are they doing? If you were to go to England and bring back 3 billion dollars, they wouldn't give you pennies with holes in them. The usurer knows very well who to give money to. As a matter of fact, the fate of those who ask for money from loan sharks was revealed at the ballot boxes, it is that simple. And now we are walking on our way with confident steps, we will walk.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Trust and stability, these two concepts are very important. I always talked about this with my friends in politics, two concepts; Trust and stability, we will continue on our way and build a strong economic management on these two concepts. We market a production economy focused on financial management, investment and employment with an international reputation. We will turn the opportunities provided by our increasing production power in every field from industry to energy into the locomotive of a new economic breakthrough that will surprise everyone.
Have we found natural gas in the Black Sea now? Have we or are we providing natural gas to our citizens free of charge for 1 month? Have we announced our decision to give 25 cubic meters of natural gas to our citizens as a gift from the Presidency for 1 year? This is us. Now oil has emerged in Gabar. He didn't get out by sleeping, he got out by working. Previously, we could not extract oil there because the terrorists, with whom Kemal was in close contact, poured concrete there, but now we can. And with this, the balances disrupted by global developments are being re-established, Turkey will hopefully have a very different power in this table and will take the place it deserves.
We will increase the security threats in our south and our fight against terrorist organizations. We will operate political and diplomatic channels more effectively. We will continue to keep them away from our borders by directing regional developments in the right way, in short, through multifaceted work. And what were Kemal's partners saying? We will be together with the terrorist organizations in our south. They did not stop there, they took steps to share the oil resources there with these terrorists. Qamishli is one of them, they acted together with the coalition forces.
We also consider the voluntary return of asylum seekers, requested by our citizens, as a part of this policy. Currently, it is our duty to meet the expectations of our citizens in this regard in ways and methods that suit our country and nation. To date, my brothers, we have enabled the voluntary return of nearly 600 thousand people to safe areas in Syrian territory. Now we have cooperated with Qatar, we will ensure the return of 1 million more people within a few years with a new resettlement project.
We will continue on our way with investments that will raise the bar in areas where we have provided centuries-old gains for our country, from education to health, from transportation to energy, from industry to agriculture, from tourism to sports. We will continue to develop practices that meet the conditions of the country and the expectations of our young people, especially vocational education.
There is no stopping... There is no stopping... Likewise, we will always move forward and expand our infrastructure and insurance system, which the world takes as an example in healthcare. We will increase our city hospitals. We will now further strengthen Turkey's hub position by taking our investments in transportation and energy, which are the basic infrastructure of development, to the global level. As a matter of fact, Mr. Putin repeated the issue of Turkey, that is, Thrace, being a hub region in this congratulatory message. We will take this step with them and thus Thrace will become a hub.
We will increase the brand value of our industry, which has become the locomotive of our country, especially our defense industry. We will implement a system that reduces input prices in agriculture and livestock, increases producer incomes and facilitates consumer access, making us one of the most important actors in the world food industry. We will continue the momentum we have achieved in tourism, the main source of income of our services sector. We will improve our social aid and support system until we reach a level where not a single member of our nation will feel abandoned or left out.
My brothers,
In short, we will evaluate every moment of the coming period with works and services worthy of the Turkish century. The conquest of Istanbul, whose 570th anniversary will be celebrated tomorrow, opened an era and closed a new one. First of all, the commander of the conquest said, ""Letüftehanne'l Kostantıniyyete, ve le ni'mel emrü zâlike'l emr, ve le ni'mel ceyşü zâlike'l ceyş. Constantinople will definitely be conquered, what a great commander is the commander who conquers it and what a great soldier his soldiers are, we fulfilled his decision 570 years ago. Tomorrow, this conquest will be celebrated in our Istanbul. What a blessed commander, what a blessed soldier.
I hope to see you as the grandchildren of these ancestors. I am proud of you. I believe in you, I trust you. Hopefully, the Turkish century, for which we see these elections as the gateway, will go down in history as such a turning point.
Yesterday, we said that Turkey is entrusted to us, and we are entrusted to Turkey and our nation. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for protecting the trust. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your love, enthusiasm, loyalty and appreciation that cannot be put into words. I remember with mercy all our martyrs who sacrificed their lives to make this land our homeland and keep it as a homeland. I commemorate our martyrs, who walked to their deaths without blinking an eye for their independence and future in front of this veteran place on the night of July 15, with perfect decency.
In your presence here, you have once again shown that the holy banner that our martyrs have carried hand to hand until today will never fall to the ground.
May God bless you all. Long live our nation that gave us another victory. Happy Türkiye century. Congratulations on our great victory in Türkiye.
I would like to end my words with Arif Nihat Asya's poem ""Dua"":
“We are small voices...
Oh my God, do not leave the minarets without adhan!
Call those who make honey here,
Oh my God, don't leave me without a hive!
Minarets have no ridge...
Oh my God, do not leave the sky without its sparkle!
The land mixed with Islam,
Oh my God, do not leave me without a Muslim!
Give us strength...
Oh my God, do not leave the field of jihad without a wrestler!
The masses waiting for heroes,
Oh God, don't leave me without a hero!
Let's know how to resist the enemy,
Oh God, do not leave us lifeless!
And the years on the roads of tomorrow,
Oh God, don't leave me without Ramadan!
Or scatter the lonely herd,
Oh my God, don't leave me without a shepherd!
You leave us without love, without water, without air;
And don't leave me stateless, my God!
My homeland mixed with Islam,
""Oh God, do not leave me without a Muslim.""
I wish God's mercy to Arif Nihat Asya. Thank you, long live, God bless you. Stay healthy.

"Strong Industry, Strong Türkiye Speech at the Istanbul Meeting Program",2023-05-25,"

Dear Industrialists,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I am very pleased to be with you, to meet your longings and chat with you. I would like to thank everyone who brought our hearts together on the occasion of the Strong Industry, Strong Turkey Istanbul Meeting, all our institutions, and the umbrella organizations of our business world. Likewise, I especially congratulate our Istanbul Provincial Directorate for leading this meeting.
At the very beginning of my words, I would like to convey my greetings to all our industrialists in Istanbul through you. I would like to express my gratitude to all our industrialists who have contributed to Turkey's development, strengthening and achievement of its economic goals. You are the best person to appreciate the value of investment, employment and production. For this reason, you know best that the country's primary need is a climate of trust and stability.
This is what we have given to our country and nation for 21 years. We ensured trust, we ensured stability. Our nation also worked hard, put forth its sweat and talent. Together, we have achieved democracy and development breakthroughs worth centuries. In this process, we overcame the obstacles together, broke the traps together, and tore up the scenarios together. Together, we prepared 2023, the year in which we left behind the first century of our Republic, for the Turkish century. Now we are with you again at the door of a new future.
As you know, the Parliament phase of the May 14 elections has been completed. May 14 is not an ordinary date. May 14, let's go like this: 1950 and we realized a new structuring of it and won the favor of our nation on May 14, but it was not enough, even by a hair's breadth. Now we're doing the second round on Sunday. Sunday has come and I believe that on Sunday, our nation will hand over this date, which is almost a complement to May 14, to this brother of yours, hopefully with a different rate.
Why am I saying this? First of all, our nation made its choice in the Parliament in favor of the People's Alliance with 323 deputies. What does this mean? So, as the Nation Alliance, you do not have the chance to do anything legislatively in the Parliament. Our nation has now given this chance and this will to the People's Alliance. More than 27 million of our citizens showed great favor to us during the Presidency, with 49.5 percent of the votes. However, due to the system, the election was postponed to the second round. Our nation has reaffirmed its trust in us in the governance of the country by giving the majority of the Parliament to the People's Alliance. At the same time, with this decision, our nation has sent very clear messages to the opposition and the whole world. He gave a vote of confidence to the Presidential System of Government by saying no to the proposals to return our country to the days of coalition, that is, to the proposals of the old Turkey. He showed at the ballot box that his heart is closed to those who do business secretly or openly with terrorist organizations.
Now, I would like to emphasize one issue in particular. Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu in his statement on TRT; He talks about us having meetings with terrorist organizations. Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, if you cannot prove this, you are a coward. In accordance with the language of the law, the defendant is obliged to prove his claim to prove that we had any meetings with terrorist organizations and their representatives anywhere. If you can't prove it, I repeat; You are a daredevil. We were not tasked with negotiating with terrorist organizations, but with shooting them in their lairs. We shot them in Cudi, we shot them in Gabar, we shot them in Tendürek, we shot them in Bestler Creek and we still continue to shoot them. You, on the other hand, get instructions from Kandil, go not even to their party buildings, but to their rooms in the Parliament, hold meetings with them, and draw the road map together by having meetings with them.
It is out of the question for us to come together with terrorist organizations or hold meetings in cosmic rooms. And I say again; The proof is yours. My nation knows very well where Erdoğan and his friends stand in the fight against terrorism. If Cudi, Gabar, Tendürek, Bestler Deresi could speak on this subject, then you would learn this job much better. But on the contrary, you carried out discussions on how to take steps with terrorists even across the border with HDP, with whom you are currently walking side by side, unfortunately. Where did you do it? You did it in the chambers of the Parliament. All conventional media has already revealed this, everything is clear. You get up and say that you already live your life with lies in the evening and lies in the morning, and yet you invite us to the television without shame or boredom. Your problem is different, you want to be famous. Lying fame is enough for you, we don't have time to give you another cushion of fame. Because even though those whose lives are based on lies misunderstood the message and suddenly strayed into completely different channels, our nation's stance is clear and has not changed.
Frankly, we are wondering how those who cannot digest the election results and continue to insult our nation, especially our earthquake-affected citizens, will ask for their votes on Sunday. Here you go, everything is clear, he went to Hatay, why didn't he go to Defne there? If only you went to Defne. You received 90 percent of the votes in Defne, we received 8 percent. But we did not put aside the issue of building a hospital in Defne just because the CHP received 90 percent of the votes here. On the contrary, what did we say when our partners were asking whether a hospital could be built in two or three months? Yes, we will build this hospital in Defne in two to three months. Did we? We did. Once we opened it, we did that too. Come on, you went to Hatay, you should also go to Defne and see the hospital. Dear Mr. Kemal, we built Professor Doctor Murat Dilmener Hospital at Atatürk Airport in 45 days. We did the same project in Sancaktepe in 45 days as Pakize Öz Hospital. We do it, we have a difference. We do not talk about any work that we cannot do, we talk about what we will do.
But there is no table left anymore, where will you hit it? On the opposition side, it's like dust and smoke. The CHP Chairman continues his familiar politics on his own, with both the problems within his own party and his drifts based on lack of principles. No one, including his own party members, has the strength to support this person. The decision is on Sunday, hopefully on Sunday, after the elections, we as a nation will put an end to Kılıçdaroğlu's suffering. It's not easy, I mean you competed with us in 15 elections and lost all of them. Now you are re-entering as a presidential candidate.
The CHP Chairman is in such a desperate situation that he is trying to cover up his history of cassette conspiracy through a video made by our young people who are working like crazy. Let's put aside how he got into that seat, it is obvious what he did to someone who left the CHP and became a presidential candidate just yesterday. The calls for support made by the leaders of the terrorist organization in Qandil almost every day continued uninterruptedly after May 14. He says I have no relationship with them. And how come? Look, support messages are being broadcast to you from all of them, including the conventional media. Be careful, no such support message is published for Erdoğan, God forbid. We do not accept the support from them anyway. Our nation's support is enough for us. This is our difference.
The attacks of supporters of the terrorist organization in Europe against those who did not vote for them continued until the polls closed. You probably hear and see how they are attacking those who voted for the People's Alliance or those they know will vote at the polls.
Moneylenders abroad; Mr. Kemal, you know that he was going to take 300 billion dollars from the loan sharks in London. There are financiers and bankers among us here, and they know very well how to bring money from here to here. Or would that be a lie? Enough is enough, we're fed up. London's loan sharks, they are probably marijuana and heroin smugglers at most, I think they said, don't delay, go ahead, if you bring this job after the election, we will send you something from here. Mr. Kemal, they won't even give or send you 2.5 cents with holes. No, there is no bagel for 25 cents, who are you kidding?
The delusions of those who point fingers at our country are not over yet. It is a separate tragedy that we are faced with a mentality that thinks that it can reverse all these facts by taking on board someone whose only qualifications are hostility towards refugees and hostility towards foreign investors.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Look, we have now built briquette houses in Northern Syria, we did this not only as the state but also with our non-governmental organizations. In addition, efforts to build houses in Syria that can accommodate 1 million refugees supported by Qatar are continuing, and yesterday, my Minister of Internal Affairs started the groundbreaking ceremony for this. And with this, we have created and are creating the infrastructure for the Syrians in Turkey to go there voluntarily, not by expelling them suddenly, not by sending them by force or fraud. Just as Germany, France and America invite such refugees to their countries, we wanted to do a similar practice and we are doing this. Because we believe that the work we do should have a humane, conscientious and, on the other hand, an Islamic aspect.
Now, if you want, let's take a look at the video of those scandalous statements that the CHP Chairman wants to make us forget. Let's see how the PKK supports Kılıçdaroğlu.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Is everything clear? Is the document available? Is the evidence clear? Do I need to say anything else? He still says that we have no cooperation with terrorists; There it is, your life is a lie. There is no need to say more. I believe that, hopefully, on Sunday, my nation will hold accountable those who will be hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with these terrorists for this evidence and these paintings. We will complete the unfinished work on May 14, and then we will work day and night together to build Turkey's century.
My brothers,
Who is this Selo? He is the terrorist who took the lives of 51 of our Kurdish brothers in Diyarbakır. What does he say now? He says if you want to remove Selo, you will vote for us. Who says this? Kılıçdaroğlu. My nation will not vote for Kılıçdaroğlu who is trying to eliminate a terrorist, I believe that. Because my nation is national, local, my nation is patriotic, it will never give way to you and will hold them accountable on Sunday.
God says that a person gets only as much as he works for. We, as a country and nation, know very well that our only solution is to be rewarded for what we work for and to walk the path by getting the reward. We will continue to fight this way starting from Monday.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As business people, you know the account and the book very well. My minister just stated that, come to think of it, their total vote share does not even reach 1 percent, but they won 40 seats in parliament. When you multiply this to the vote rate, you were an accounting expert, the number of deputies left to you as an accounting expert is incomparably less, you are gone. Now look at your situation after Monday, how will your situation be? I am one of your brothers who was involved in trade at one point in his life. I learned life not in glass mansions like others, but in Kasımpaşa, in Istanbul, which is the summary of Turkey. We know very well what it means to survive in this city, to live with honor and dignity in this city with our heads held high. We took what we learned in Istanbul as our guide at every stage of our political life. Whatever we did, we first looked back at our nation. We have never made the interests of the country and the nation a subject of negotiation.
I served as the Mayor of Istanbul for 4.5 years, and the people of Istanbul know best the value of the period during which I was the Mayor of Istanbul. And think about it, Istanbul, I always describe CHP like this, garbage-pit-mud, three C's. Was there trash? There were mountains. There were potholes. There was mud. But beyond all this, Istanbul was also thirsty. And we brought water to Istanbul from the Istranca Mountains, 110 kilometers away, and saved Istanbul from thirst.
I'm leaving that aside, I took over the Mayorship of Istanbul from CHP's Nurettin Sözen, and at that time they brought natural gas to 50 thousand households. We took office and when I went to prison, I brought natural gas to 1 million 250 thousand households and that's how I went to prison. We are proud of these. Mr. Kemal, tell me what is your past, what is your reference? Our reference is obvious, these are. From that day to today, here is the Golden Horn. What was the state of the Golden Horn? Istanbulites know the state of the Golden Horn, can you pass through it because of the smell? It was not passing. But we transferred all the dirt and mud of the Golden Horn to a quarry in Alibeyköy, 9.5 kilometers away, like an oil pipeline. And that quarry in Alibeyköy is now a playground for children, we have turned it into a huge area.
And again, we laid the foundation of the place on the edge of the Golden Horn, which is now the Haliç Congress Center. May God have mercy on him, when our brother Kadir Topbaş took over, he created today's work. That's who we are. It was impossible to pass through there, because there were gutters there, sacrifices were made there, it was such a place. But if we do it, we said we would do it and we did it. Look, CHP is holding meetings in that congress center today and tomorrow in the same way; Look, we did it. If it were up to you, it wouldn't be possible for you to do such a thing anyway, you didn't say anything like that anyway.
Likewise, Ataturk Cultural Center, all those so-called artists were saying that it could not be built if this place was demolished. Regarding Muhsin Ertuğrul, they were saying that if this place is demolished, it cannot be built. I am the Mayor. The Istanbul Congress Center you see is 40 meters deep, this part is 17 meters deep, but there are also car parks etc. underneath. And this place was also built during our Mayor's term, and those so-called artists said they will not build the theater here; We did it, we did it bigger, we did it better. Well, this is our difference, this is our difference. AKM, Ataturk Cultural Center was built magnificently and is currently in service. We did not promise anything that we could not do, we did it and now services are provided to all art lovers.
When it comes to Turkey's survival, we have no regard for anyone. To this end, we challenged the world's most powerful lobbies when necessary, and we fought against all terrorist organizations, from PKK to FETO. Remember the night of July 15, we shielded our chests from planes, tanks and deadly weapons. We did not hesitate to risk our lives and political fortune by taking all kinds of risks when necessary, but we never compromised the rights of our country, our nation and the hundreds of millions of oppressed and victimized people who pinned their hopes on us.
We courageously defended Turkey's interests in all international platforms, from the United Nations to NATO, from the G20 to other structures. We have successfully brought our country to safety from the world's most difficult tests, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. We did not fall for the tricks of those who tried to make Turkey a party to the conflicts in its region. We have become a country that does not add fuel to the fire of war, but rather strives to stop the shedding of blood and tears.
We have not stepped back anywhere, from the Eastern Mediterranean to the blue homeland. We neither extended our hands to what was not ours, nor did we consent to others extending our nation's morsel. We tried to find common ground with everyone whose heart beats for Türkiye in politics. We opened our doors and arms wide to all our citizens who put their country and nation first. Of course, we met and consulted with everyone when necessary for this.
We listened to justified criticisms, we would evaluate every offer that would be good for Turkey, no matter who it came from, but we never saw politics as a horse bargain. We did not engage in politics with the mentality of ""what should I give to my brother?"" We were not among those who indulged in the cheapness of choose-like-buy, we were like this yesterday and we act like this today.
The People's Alliance is an alliance of common values, not daily interests. People's Alliance is the address of those who meet on the common ground of Türkiye. The People's Alliance is the umbrella of those who put the survival of the homeland above all else. Everything else is nonsense.
Now, let's briefly watch the video of what we have brought to our country in the last 21 years.
Yes, for 21 years, we have waged a struggle not by beating around the bush, but by putting stones upon stones. Praise be to God, we have introduced our country to the best achievements in its history in every field. We continued our work and service journey uninterruptedly during the election campaign period.
So, what did the CHP Chairman do while we were dealing with these? What proposal did he bring that would pave the way for our country and cure our nation's problems? Of course nothing. Moreover, the collaborations that the CHP Chairman entered into in this process are really very painful and troublesome. This person buttoned the first button incorrectly before setting out. He ignored the values ​​that are the backbone and supporting pillar of politics. It did not occur to him that the issues regarding the country and the nation could not and should not be made a matter of give and take. He did this in the number of vice president positions, he did this in matters related to ministries, he did this in his statements that were not based on any calculations, he did this in his relations with Western ambassadors. Leaving aside principles, principles, moral and national values, and acting only for his own personal account, he polluted politics and poisoned the language of politics. This person, who says he is an accounting expert every time he opens his mouth, offered almost 40 deputies to 4 parties that received even 1 percent of the total votes.
The price of leaving the table for 3 days was the vice presidential position given to the mayors of Ankara and Istanbul Metropolitan Municipalities. Look, this Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has been in office for 4 years. As Istanbulites, can you say what he has done to Istanbul? He has provided great services. Likewise, what did Ankara do to Ankara? We have been living in Ankara for 4 years, we see nothing.
He went to every party he knocked on with a seat on his tray. I am saying this loud and clear here, there is no one who has ever sat at the table with the CHP Chairman and left without getting more than he wanted. Everyone who came saying ""maybe we could do something"" left with a large amount of parliamentary seats, vice-presidential positions, and promises of 3 or 5 ministries each. Everyone who came to the door of the CHP with a blank bill in their hand, took the signature from the CHP Chairman and wrote the number on it themselves.
We experienced the best example of this yesterday, the CHP Chairman has made unprecedented inconsistencies in history in the last 4 months just to protect his seat. He left a huge stain not only on his party but also on Turkish politics. We know what is the problem of those who make false accusations to cover up their own inconsistencies and lack of principles. No matter what you do, Mr. Kemal, you will not be able to forget your cooperation with terrorist organizations.
You will not be able to make anyone forget that you marketed your party's deputies for your personal gain and promised positions and positions to anyone who came along. Whatever you do, you will not be able to forget that you have made the interests of this country a matter of bargaining in the international arena. I believe that our nation will hold you accountable for all of this on May 28.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
There is little time left to enter the new century of our Republic. When we look back, unfortunately we have gone through great difficulties over the past century. Our country has been subjected to coup attempts almost every 10 years. The coups disrupted democracy on the one hand, and development moves on the other. Our country's democracy and especially its industry have suffered a great blow. The development steps taken were always left unfinished because of the coalition governments that were constantly collapsed and re-established. You know best the value of the last 21 years of our country. You are the best example of what can be achieved in a climate of trust and stability. During this period, our industrialists had the opportunity to make long-term plans with us. It is not for nothing that the first target of those who base their entire strategy on spreading a climate of fear in the country is our industrialists and investors. Thank God, you did not fall for this game. We witnessed your upright stance during the Covid-19 epidemic, even when the world economy was deeply shaken and the energy and food crisis fluctuated prices all over the world. We know that in such a period, you increased our exports to over 254 billion dollars and pushed employment to the 32 million mark. I congratulate you wholeheartedly.
Of course, we are aware of the problems we experience during the poisoning of the political climate in our country, as in the crises experienced in the world. We know all of your financial demands, new investment area needs, and workforce expectations. Just as we have solved all your problems so far, we will also provide solutions to them. It was not possible for someone who had no skill other than to bankrupt SGK to do what we could not do. It is just a dream that someone who loses every election he enters and can only protect his own seat can find a solution to your problems. We believe that together we will raise our country among the top 10 economies of the world in the Turkish century.
Now, let's take a look at our plans for the coming period.
Yes, we will implement these one by one with your contribution. For this reason, we continue to support our industrialists, SMEs, tradesmen, artisans and employees.
There is no province left in our country that does not have an organized industrial zone. As of today, the number of organized industrial zones in our country has increased to 353 and employment has increased to 2.5 million. By establishing 21 new organized industrial zones in 2022 alone, we broke a record in this field. As of this year, we have made 9.6 billion lira support payments within the scope of the support program for micro and small businesses that we implemented after the epidemic. We are preparing to launch the second leg of the program soon. With the 5 thousand 455 investment incentive certificates we issued last year, we paved the way for fixed investments worth 261 billion lira and 110 thousand additional employment. We decided to support 178 projects in the fields of machinery, mobility, structural transformation in production, health, chemistry and digital transformation for the development of local and national technologies. We have implemented many other supports and programs like these. We do not discuss with anyone the value we give to our industrialists, small and medium-sized enterprises. We will build the century of Türkiye developing through value-added production together with you.
For this reason, I want you to support the ballot box again and more tightly on Sunday. I believe that together we will once again demonstrate the superiority of the national will to everyone, friend or foe, for the continuation of Turkey's climate of trust and stability.
I pray that God will open our path and our fortune. I greet you all with love and respect. Stay healthy.

",2023-05-28,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won the election between 2 candidates.,before
Their Speech at the Keçiören NGO Representatives and Mukhtars Meeting,2023-05-24,"

Dear Ankara residents,
Dear Beautiful People of Keçiören,
Dear Representatives of Our Non-Governmental Organizations,
Dear Mukhtar Brothers,
My Dear Citizens,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. From here, I greet all of Keçiören with its avenues, streets and houses. I send my greetings and love to all my brothers from Ankara. I am very pleased to be with you and to satisfy your longing again.
As you know, this brother of yours is not a guest in Keçiören, we are hosts. I lived in Subayevleri for years and was your neighbor. I lived side by side with you for 12 years. There were days when we shared the pain together, there were days when we faced difficulties together, there were days when we celebrated our successes and victories together. It's been a day and we rejoiced together with the good news we received. It's been a day since we stood in the same line and supported the same funeral. Thank God, we have had really good days, both bitter and sweet, for 12 years. Afterwards, we never severed our ties with Keçiören and our neighbors from Keçiören, we came to Keçiören whenever we had the opportunity, we got along with you and made up for our longings. We continued to be closely interested in all the issues, troubles and affairs of Keçiören. Keçiören never left us alone. Our brothers from Keçiören were always with us with their prayers. During the elections, our brothers from Keçiören always stood firm with us. We have always seen that upright stance from my brothers from Keçiören during the elections, and with this upright stance, now I see that Keçiören is preparing for Sunday with the same upright stance.
Is Keçiören ready for Sunday?
Are we ready to go door to door?
We don't leave a door without knocking, right?
Youth; Are you ready to walk hand in hand with all your interlocutors? Are we ready for the roaring Sunday? I believe in you, I love you, and I believe that you will teach Mr. Kemal the necessary lesson on Sunday. On May 14, you once again demonstrated Keçiören's love for us and the People's Alliance. I would like to thank my brothers from Keçiören who supported us with 52.5 percent of the votes, above the average of Turkey.
I was in Malatya yesterday. We addressed 50 thousand people in Malatya, earthquake housing containers there. I know that Keçiören is exactly like Malatya.
There was rain and rain today, so unfortunately we had to hold this meeting in a closed hall. I believe that if we had done it outdoors, we would have collected at least 50 thousand, 60 thousand there. Would we collect? Thanks. But now we will collect it at the ballot boxes. And I went from Malatya to Sivas. Sivas was different, completely different. I'll give you the numbers now, do you know what was in Sivas? 100 thousand. Brave people got excited, Brave people filled the streets.
This time I say; Hopefully, on Sunday, Ankara will fill the ballot boxes with its first and second regions, turning the calculations upside down. Are we ready to turn these calculations upside down? Are we ready for this?
What did you do in the Parliament with a vote rate exceeding 53? As Keçiören, who said the People's Alliance, you turned Kemal's entire calculations upside down. Now, giving the majority in the Parliament to the People's Alliance with 323 deputies is both a sign of trust and a statement of will; This is really important. In other words, the People's Alliance has now established a foothold in the Parliament with 323 deputies. What does this mean? In other words, we are in the People's Alliance as the legislative body. And our nation has trampled on the talk of strengthened parliamentary democracy. What did he say? He said to continue with the People's Alliance.
Our nation rejected the proposals to go back to the old days of Turkey, where governments changed every 3 months, 5 months, and 8 months. Look, they are sharing seats, and think about it, in this seat sharing, these parties, whose total is 1 point, Mr. Kemal, the calculator, took about 40 MPs from him with 1 point. What is this? What kind of an accounting expert was this? Can this CHP survive with this?
Now, I am calling out to all of Turkey from Keçiören: As soon as you support your son Erdoğan on Sunday, we will hopefully have a clear future with the deputies of the 323 People's Alliance in the Parliament, and hopefully we will continue the 21 years in a different way, we will build the Turkey of the future in a different way. We call it the Turkish century, we will establish the Turkish century together with you. Our nation has shown a red card to those who seek the path to power in Qandil and Pennsylvania instead of the national will.
My brothers,
Where do they get their instructions from? He gets it from Kandil, right? He takes it from Qandil's street thugs and terrorists. Where do we get it from? We receive from God, we receive from our nation. This is our difference, this is how we have come so far, and this is how we will continue from now on. Our nation, the youth, said to those who wanted to hand over their economy to the loan sharks and IMF commissioners in London, get out of there.
What does Mr. Kemal say? He was going to bring 300 billion dollars from London. What if there was an accountant everywhere, what would he say? If the people next to you were accountants, what would they say? You don't know anything about accounting, you don't have any books, nothing. We have forgotten the accounts you know.
And my dear brothers and sisters; They met with the IMF commissioners in the lobbies of the hotels, together with the Spokesperson of the IYI Party and a person who once worked at the Central Bank of the IYI Party. And in their meetings with the IMF commissioners, they gave us advice and said to borrow from the IMF. What did we say? No, we cut off our relationship with the IMF in 2013. We had a debt of 23.5 billion dollars, and we reduced this debt to zero in 2013. And at that time, our Central Bank's reserves were 27.5 billion dollars, we moved forward with great enthusiasm, and at one point during my term as Prime Minister, we increased the reserves to 135 billion dollars. Again, I hope we will reach this reserve, because we are determined on this issue, we have no problems, we will continue on our way with the same determination.
Don't look at the tricks of these speculators, don't look at the tricks of this gentleman Kemal and his cronies, these are all temporary transactions. See if Türkiye is standing.
Our nation has repeatedly declared that it will not surrender to the forces that point fingers at it through foreign magazine covers. From here, I would like to thank all my citizens who said that stability will continue and Turkey will grow on May 14. We need to further strengthen this picture formed in the Parliament and move it to May 28. We need to show the same will that you showed for the parliament, both in the second round and in the presidency. It is very important that the legislature and the executive work in harmony to avoid any disruption in services.
My brothers,
Türkiye used to suffer from conflicts between state bodies. A constitutional booklet thrown in front of the Prime Minister cost our country billions of dollars. You know who threw the constitutional booklet in front of the then Prime Minister Mr. Ecevit and his associates, right? The person who is currently walking arm in arm with Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, they have caused this country a lot of suffering. Not only the political establishment, but all of Türkiye paid the price for instability. Our young people could not find a job, our tradesmen did not make sales, our tourism professionals waited for the tourist route. Our merchants, exporters and industry could not sell products. Except for a handful of elites, all members of our nation, including industrialists, workers, farmers, civil servants, retirees, and housewives, have suffered. Have we experienced these? We lived.
We have reversed this with the climate of trust we have established in the last 21 years. We did not allow tutelage forces to usurp the will of the nation. We did not allow a power struggle between the legislature, executive and judiciary. By ensuring that each organ remained within its own jurisdiction, we prevented our country from drifting into political instability, we did not give way, and of course, we achieved this with the help of our beloved nation. You protected us, and we protected your rights and law. You trusted us, and we never violated your trust. You supported us, we stood firm everywhere, and we will continue on our way from now on.
Youth; Do you recommend all your interlocutors and friends to go to the polls on Sunday? We don't leave it blank, huh?
We will ensure that the legislature, executive and judiciary work in coordination and harmony to serve our nation, and hopefully we will do this with the strong support of you, my brothers from Keçiören. There are few days ahead of us, 4 days. There is a new election in 4 days, we will not make any plans other than voting on Sunday. We will go to the polls early in the morning to vote and show our will. We will make sure that our spouses, friends and neighbors go to the polls with us. No complacency. No getting drunk with victory. The indispensable ballot box is the indispensable ballot box, and we will march to victory at the ballot box, with God's permission.
Remember, our opponent on May 28 is never the CHP Chairman. Our biggest rival is complacency, complacency, giving up, and getting carried away with the feeling that we are already ahead and we will win anyway. For this reason, we will definitely not allow the poison of victory intoxication to spread. I would like to underline that I expect a record from my neighbors from Keçiören this time. I trust you, I believe in you, I know very well that you will not embarrass me. I pray that God bless our solidarity and love forever.
My brothers,
Both Ankara and Turkey passed a very successful test for our democracy on May 14. Despite all the provocations, our nation literally flocked to the ballot box. Despite the opposition's tense politics, none of our people suffered a nosebleed. Despite the dignity executioners carried out in different media, the nation freely expressed its choice at the ballot box. Our citizens from all political parties cast their votes and declared their decisions in maturity, peace and tranquility. The Turkish nation demonstrated its will at a record rate that made even the European countries who had been preaching democracy to us for years jealous. On May 14, we not only saw the power of Turkish democracy, but also witnessed the bursting of many perception bubbles.
Oh my God, what statements did the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality make, what statements did the Metropolitan Mayor of Ankara make together? Now, are we ready to bury all of these in the ballot box on Sunday? So no stopping… No stopping… No stopping…
What did all these people say? They wanted to follow the dictatorship slanders against Turkey. In the smear campaigns carried out by those who could not get even half of the voters to go to the polls in their own country, Turkey had almost 90 percent of its voters cast their votes.
There were insidious psychological operations carried out against us in the international press. There were lies and falsehoods that the opposition repeated publicly. Anyway, Mr. Kemal has no capital other than lies, lies in the evening, lies in the morning. And there was also the politics of fear fueled by the CHP Chairman and his associates. We threw all this away with the will manifested in the ballot box on the night of May 14th. He showed that dictatorship rhetoric was pure nonsense. Think about it, will the dictator make it to the second round? The dictator finishes his job in the first round, and he finishes with 90 percent; There are many examples of this in the world. We long to win the hearts of our nation, not dictatorship; this is our situation.
We showed the whole world that our nation cannot be judged by magazine covers. We showed that the will of the Turkish nation cannot be chained. We showed that elections cannot be won with the politics of lies, slander and fear. We showed that we should not walk with separatists and FETO members. With all this, we have again demonstrated to everyone, friend and foe, the power of Turkey, the level of maturity that Turkish democracy has reached, and the foresight and foresight of our nation. I congratulate you, my brothers, who turned the ballot boxes into a holiday place. May God be pleased with you.
However, that night there were also people who could not accept your stance. Indeed, that night we witnessed attitudes and lies that we would never want to experience in the name of our democracy. Before even 1/10 of the ballot boxes were opened, they gathered members of the press and declared the CHP Chairman as president. Even though they knew very well that they were behind, they tried to deceive their voters by saying that they were ahead and winning. They stubbornly continued this spree of lies without a break throughout the night. Now they have come out and said, without shame or shame, if we deceived the CHP members, what do they say to you? Instead of admitting their mistakes and apologizing to the nation and our CHP citizens, they are trying to get away with it by lying in the mud.
I say it very clearly; We do not accept that our CHP citizens are treated like this, insulted and humiliated like this, even if they do not vote for us. We cannot stomach the fact that before every election, CHP voters are forced to vote for the candidate they do not want by the Chairman himself, telling them that they will vote for him. What does this mean? You will go ahead and vote. It can never be tolerated that politicians who do not want to lose their seats use arrogant language towards our nation for whatever reason, such politics cannot be done, such politics cannot be done. I believe that our citizens, who still vote for CHP for Gazi's sake, are also disturbed by these impositions. Again, I know that these citizens also object to the negotiations made by the current CHP administration with separatists and FETO members. The PKK ringleaders in Kandil asking for votes for Kılıçdaroğlu with the videos they shoot almost every day offends sincere CHP members the most. The work of the scoundrels in Pennsylvania as the advertising agency of the head of the CHP is what makes these citizens the most humble.
Now, if you want, let's remember what Kandil did.
My brothers,
Yes, these are the statements that the head of the CHP has not been silent about for months. What does this mean? Mr. Kemal, how are you different from those terrorists? They support you, can you stand up and say I don't need your support? You can't say. Why? Because the support that comes from there is honey and cream for you. What does the other one say? He attacks Gazi Mustafa Kemal. What does he say next? He says ""herds of dogs, herds of dogs, herds of dogs"" and this is from HDP. Where are you, Mr. Kemal, you don't say the slightest thing. He cannot say it, because the conversations he had with them behind closed doors are obvious, everything is so open and clear.
Well, I ask you; Have you ever heard any objection from the table regarding all these disgraces that are the summary of the summary? Have you seen the table object to this, except for 1-2 sentences that are vague and can be taken wherever you want? Not only did they not object, they went and held a joint rally with them calling for ""blood for blood, revenge for revenge"", where is it? In Van.
Did they martyred our son Yasin Börü and our 51 Kurdish brothers, who went from square to square and distributed sacrificial meat among them during the events of October 6-8, in Diyarbakır?
Isn't this Selo the terrorist who made that call? What does he say now? He says what is Selo's sin? He says what is Kavala's sin? Oh Kavala, the architect of the Gezi Events. The terrorist who caused the death of 51 of our Kurdish brothers in Selo. What does he say now? He says I will take it out, he says his presence inside disturbs me, who is it? Mr. Kemal.
I believe that all my patriotic, national-loving citizens, my fellow citizens from Ankara, my brothers from Istanbul, and the whole of Turkey will teach them the necessary lesson at the ballot box on Sunday.
They went to the village where PKK was founded and shot a video saying ""spring will come here"". They greeted the nation with victory signs, which are the symbols of PKK and left-wing organizations. In other words, they welcomed the statements of support from Qandil with applause until the nation was slapped at the ballot box on May 14. They proudly claimed their partnership with the separatists. Now they are trying to give us a lesson in morality and the People's Alliance a lesson in nationalism. May they love you, Mr. Kemal, when did you become a nationalist? Either these are like this, evening is different, morning is different, these have every trick. But I say; I hope we can build a political grave for those who think they are using all these tricks. Are we ready for that?
We probably also like the patriotism they discovered after May 14. Like everything else they do, their patriotism and nationalism are masks, but my nation will not swallow that. They cannot deceive anyone by throwing flowers to the PKK in the east, saluting the separatists, and calling it homeland-nation in Ankara. May 28 is an opportunity for this, are we ready for it? I believe that May 28 will, among other things, lead to a change in the opposition in our country.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I have been in the presence of our nation for 40 years, 21 of which have been in power. During this period, we did not separate anyone, we did not discriminate, we did not mix anyone, and we did not interfere with anyone. We lifted the bans, put an end to the oppression, and put an end to unlawfulness. We were never interested in anyone's sect, disposition, origin, or attire. We strived to embrace everyone and expand the freedom of all segments of society. We have always appeared before our people with our works and services. First, we summarized the promises we made, and then we explained what we would do in the next 5 years. We showed our report card and requested our nation's support for the new term. We detailed what we will do after May 28, one by one, in our election manifesto. We shared with the public the additional steps, projects and targets we will take on every issue, from the economy to the fight against inflation, from education to health, from the defense industry to tourism. Where did we go from 78 universities in education? We increased to 208 universities. Did we put our booklets on the desks? Did all our children, primary school, middle school and high school, find their books on the desks? And do we currently have universities in all 81 provinces?
Well, ask them, what did you do? What did your Metropolitan Municipality do in Ankara, what did it do in Istanbul, what did it do in Izmir? Nothing, they can't.
But did we build Bilkent City Hospital in Ankara? Did we do Etlik? And along with all this, did we also build our other hospitals in Ankara? If it does... If it does... We will continue to do it again.
You know where we have come, you see the services we have provided to Ankara in the last 21 years. You see the works and investments we have brought to your hometowns where you were born and raised in the last 21 years. Likewise, you know very well what the CHP mentality has done to this country before, everything is obvious. On one side, you have a brother who has fulfilled all his promises to the nation, and on the other side, you have a person who denies what he said in the morning and who has become known as a swindler. On one side, there is one of you who works, rushes and sweats for all 85 million people, and on the other side, there is a poor person who has lost his composure so much that he accuses half of the society of selling his country. On the one hand, there is a responsible administration that has not neglected the earthquake zone despite the election agenda, and on the other hand, there is a lack of conscience that promises free houses in the squares and kicks out our earthquake victims after the election.
Now I am calling out to my farmer brothers from here; Did you buy the tractors? Did you buy the houses? It's like this everywhere, lie after lie. They cannot compete with us. We came to this nation not to be masters, but to be servants. If you are ready now, let's renew our covenant immediately.
Are we ready?
One nation… One flag… One homeland… One state… We will be one… We will be big… We will be alive… We will be brothers… We will all be Turkey together…
Stay healthy. I pray that God will help us. Thank you, long live, God bless you.

Their Speech at the Great Rumelia Meeting,2023-05-22,"

Our Dear Youth,
Dear Ladies and Sisters,
My Dear Citizens,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. From here, I wholeheartedly greet all of Rumelia, the Balkans, and all corners of our heartland through you. I send my love and respect to all our brothers, our compatriots, and all our friends who are a part of our lives, whose hearts beat with us.
I would like to thank all my brothers and sisters who brought us together in this beautiful atmosphere, helped us embrace and relieve our longing. Today, here I feel the warm breath of Skopje, Sanjak, Prizren, Shkodra, Kircaali, Komotini, Plovdiv, Sarajevo and Mostar in my heart.
Today, I hear the voices of our Raiders who have been standing at the gates of Vienna for centuries, chanting God's praises. Today, here I hear the thin, elegant, delicate wings of Rumelian folk songs that make our hearts tremble. Today, I see here a magnificent flood of love and a sea of ​​conversation stretching from Bursa to Bosnia, from Istanbul to Skopje. Here I see the symbol of our eternal and eternal brotherhood, whose dough is kneaded with pain, suffering, love, affection and solidarity.
The poet said it beautifully:
“A Rumelia Folk Song fluttered in silver vases
A warm prayer fell into my hands
Burmese moustached laments restrained the time
A green rose spoke on blood-soaked hooves
While silence scissors the partridges in the sky
I was burned from my very home by a rain of call to prayer
And I closed my eyes in Istanbul
I woke up in Skopje, in Tetovo…
Beyond, bloodlines, mosques, fountains...
Fatih Bridge smiles too
The wind shaking the Vardar Plain
It also makes hearts flutter.
They call his name Esztergon
I have a lover in Rumelia...""
Yes, we have many friends all over Rumelia. We have many brothers and sisters with whom our hearts are united, not only in Rumelia, but also in three continents and seven climates, from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from the Adriatic to the Altai. We have many lovers who cry every night with their hands raised to the sky, praying that God will not harm Turkey.
Even though our language, religion, culture and skin color are different, we have hundreds of millions of friends who pin their hopes on the success of our country. Here in this hall, I see Akıncı children stopping us wherever we go in Rumelia and saying hello to Turkey's stones and soil. In front of me, I see the representatives of Turkey's minstrels, whose number reaches hundreds of millions, along with the relics of the Serdengeçti. I would like to thank you, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, for your enthusiasm that does not fit into the living rooms.
I thank you for your upright stance that instills confidence in friends. I thank you for your support in the May 14 elections. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your love that gave us the good news of the result that will come out of the ballot box on May 28. What beautiful people you are. What loyal people you are. I pray that God bless our love forever.
My brothers,
We are a state that inherited our independence and future flag from the Ottoman Empire, whose sovereignty area reached 10 million square kilometers for a period. The Republic of Turkey is not the first, but the last state of our struggle for existence and non-existence in these lands for a thousand years.
Aliya was in her last period, I was coming from abroad and I landed the plane in Sarajevo and from there I said let me go to the hospital and visit Aliya. And I went to the hospital, visited Aliya in her last moments, and her last sentences were very meaningful, she said; ""Tayyip, my son, these lands are the children of Fatihan, this land, which is the son of Fatihan, is entrusted to you,"" he said. Then I heard from my brother Bakir, he said; My father wasn't talking until that moment, but after meeting you he started talking there. Of course, this was a flood of emotions for us. I praised my Lord. But we have received such a trust that we, the sons of Fatihan, cannot look at those lands from afar. We know how to look after them as a trust and we will.
Throughout history, as a nation, we have taught the whole world a lesson in humanity with our dignity, conscience, mercy and compassion. We first wrote a great epic in Çanakkale with our brothers who made Anatolia their home. Together, we defeated Çanakkale against the strongest armies in the world. The retreat process, which started after the victories of our ancestors extending into the interior of Europe, ended only with the Great Offensive. We crowned our War of Independence with victory under the leadership of Gazi Mustafa Kemal, who was also from Rumelia.
By establishing the Republic, whose 100th anniversary we will celebrate on October 29, our nation has gained a safe shelter where it can heal its wounds and recover for the first time in centuries. Of course, during this period, migration from the remaining places of the Empire, from Rumelia to the Caucasus, to Anatolia continued to increase. Thousands of people lost their lives in these migrations that have continued since the Ottoman Empire. Our Circassian brothers who were exiled from their homeland, the Crimean Tatars and Meskhetian Turks who were oppressed in the land of their birth, the Rumelian immigrants who were subjected to the greatest massacres in history, in short, millions of our brothers and compatriots who lived peacefully under the banner of justice of the Ottoman Empire took refuge in the lands of the Republic as a last resort. Turkey has become a land of safety and peace for Circassians, Tatars, Gagauzians, Albanians, Pomaks, Bosnians, Turkmens, Uzbeks, Uyghurs and every brother in trouble.
As a nation, we worked hand in hand and heart to heart to develop our country, strengthen our economy, and live freely and with our heads held high in these lands. Thank God, we have brought Turkey to this day by overcoming many difficulties, both bitter and sweet, shortcomings and excesses, and by enduring many attacks. We achieved this together as a nation. We have brought our country to this day with the efforts and efforts of you, our brothers and sisters who immigrated from all over our geography, especially Rumelia and the Balkans, and established a new life here.
My brothers,
Our brothers coming from Western Thrace, Bulgaria and the Balkans are not immigrants of this country, but its true children. Your grandfathers and ancestors did not come to another place, but to their homeland, their father's house. We hugged and hugged each other like brothers reunited after centuries of longing. We cannot thank God enough for having a homeland like Turkey and a home like Turkey.
The world's most vile, most disgusting and most brutal massacres were committed in the places where we had to retreat. Our brothers, who could not come to Turkey in those difficult days, experienced the pain of statelessness to their core and were subjected to severe oppression and persecution. Their languages, beliefs and traditions were tried to be destroyed. Their mosques were destroyed and their tombs were destroyed. The doors of lodges and centers of knowledge and wisdom were locked, and madrassas were closed. Inns, baths, caravanserais, fountains, soup kitchens and libraries were deliberately left in disrepair. Opinion leaders, teachers, scholars and politicians were imprisoned. They have lived and experienced everything in the name of cultural genocide many times over.
In the cities that hosted thousands of heirlooms from our ancestors 150 years ago, today you can find nothing but a few exemplary buildings. Likewise, in cities where 80 percent of the population is predominantly Muslim, today there are either no Muslims or a handful of Muslims. But the Western world never saw this, or rather always ignored it. When it comes to words, those who left no stone unturned in the name of human rights did not stop this cultural massacre in the heart of Europe. Those who teach us democracy and human rights lessons every time they open their mouths have become deaf to the pain of Rumelia and the cries rising from Rumelia. They chose to watch from the stands without doing anything, even the genocides right under their noses, such as Srebrenica in the Bosnian War, where thousands of people were murdered.
I believe in you, I love you and I know what you will do.
Unfortunately, they helped the murderers by paving the way for them, and they did this many times throughout the century. When it came to the rights and lives of Muslims and Turks, they always played the three monkeys instead of reacting, intervening and preventing oppression. In fact, today they show that nothing has changed by supporting terrorist organizations, turning a blind eye to attacks on mosques and masjids, and tormenting our Turkey-loving citizens. They do not show one tenth of the sympathy, understanding and tolerance to the oppressed and victims that they show to FETO scoundrels and separatist traitors.
Now the PKK in Europe saw that things were getting worse, yes, they started to attack voters. Oh, these voters say that they must be on the side of the People's Alliance, that's why they are attacking them.
As if that wasn't enough, they attacked the Turkish House opposite the United Nations in America and broke the windows of the Turkish House. Why were you a democrat? What do you gain by attacking the Turkish House and breaking the windows? Now, won't we say this to America's authorities and security forces: Come on, you need to find this terrorist immediately and do what is necessary. I wonder how you would view this if a similar situation occurred in Turkey? Now, we are one of the authorities of the United States and the Turkish House is entrusted to you there. You need to find this terrorist who broke the windows of the Turkish House with a crowbar.
Even though they have the opportunity and the power, they do not take any steps to end the crises, conflicts and wars. God forbid, if something were to happen to our nation and our compatriots anywhere tomorrow, rest assured that they will not act differently. But now, thank God, Turkey exists, we exist, we are ready to do whatever is necessary. We now have a country with the vision of the Turkish century.
My brothers,
Rumelia is a wound in the heart of our nation that will never heal. Falih Rıfkı Atay is one of the best writers who describe this pain in our literature. See how our author puts Rumelia into words:
“Mountains where old Turkish songs echo and their sandals rot. Behind these horizon lines is Monastery, the Monastery we are used to as Turks as much as Eyüp, and beyond are Kosovo and Skopje. The harsh waves of the Ottoman map are stirring my head. ""I leave a heartbreak with every step."" Yes, just like Falih Rıfkı, who finished his sentences by saying ""let's not forget Rumelia"", we did not forget Rumelia from our minds and hearts even for a moment. We have neither forgotten Rumelia, nor Crimea, nor Cyprus, nor Turkestan, nor the Caucasus, nor other corners of our heartland geography. We took the name of the centuries-old longing from the hands of kin and relative communities.
In the last 21 years, we not only worked day and night for Turkey's growth, strengthening and development, but also embraced again all our brothers with whom we share a common history, faith and culture. With our TİKA and our General Directorate of Foundations, we have revived the heirlooms of our ancestors and our martyrs' cemeteries. We developed our cooperation in the fields of education and culture with our Presidency for Turks Abroad. We protected our language, culture, history and common civilization values ​​with our Yunus Emre institutes and Maarif Foundation. We have strengthened our human ties with our Turkish Airlines, Anadolu Agency and TRT. We came to the aid of our brothers and sisters in their most difficult days with our Red Crescent, AFAD, and non-governmental organizations. We strengthened our commercial and economic ties with the support of our businessmen. We increased the number of our diplomatic missions and waved our flag proudly everywhere. Wherever we have a citizen or compatriot, we are there. With this understanding, we stood by and supported everyone from Rumelia to the Caucasus. We did not make any of our brothers feel helpless or abandoned. Thanks to all these efforts, we regained the heart of his son Fatihan after a hundred years of longing and conquered him again.
Just as we did not leave a single inch of land unserved in our country, we did not leave any place untouched in Rumelia. We visited all the countries beyond Thrace and almost all the cities where our compatriots live. We have engraved every stone, every mosque, tomb and bazaar of Rumelia into our hearts, stitch by stitch, like an embroidery.
During our visits, I saw our pure mortals with white skullcaps and bright faces who have been longingly waiting for the path of the loyal Turk for years. I saw the orphans of Murad-ı Hüdavendigar, who prayed for Turkey and for the strengthening of our country with every breath. I saw heroes who clung to their language, religion and culture after all the oppression they experienced. I saw dervishes whose hearts burned with the love of God and the love of the Prophet, despite all the pressure and torture they were subjected to. I saw girls, girls, women, and dignified fathers who started life with a new hope every morning. In Rumelia, I saw not only the footprints of an ancestor who ruled the world with justice for six centuries, but also a huge Anatolia. We saw Bursa and Istanbul in Rumelia. I saw Konya, Sakarya, Erzurum, Kayseri, Baku, Ganja, Samarkand, Khiva. In short, I saw our civilization in all its glory in those lands. I saw Turkey and the Turkish nation in all their greatness.
My brothers,
With these steps, in addition to fulfilling the requirements of our law of brotherhood, we also closed the wounds opened in our hearts due to negligence. We made our country's presence felt in those lands again, both diplomatically, politically and economically. Today, thank God, we can come to the aid of our brothers in even the slightest trouble. We did this when there was a flood in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did this when there was an earthquake in Albania. We did this when any disaster occurred in other countries. We did this when they faced the risk of political instability. We have always been there for our brothers and sisters in their difficult and dark days. When we complete the Sara Bosnia-Belgrade highway project, which we call the Peace Path, we will open a new windpipe to the Balkans.
So, what was the opposition in our country busy with while we were doing these? Apart from the meetings they organized to save appearances, they did not do anything worthwhile regarding Rumelia and the Balkans. Have you heard the slightest step of our opposition regarding the Balkans? No, they don't have that problem. The problem is ours, we are in love with the Balkans and Rumelia, we have a difference.
Now, apart from the forced steps they took when they saw the ballot box on the horizon, they did not knock on her son Fatihan's door, did not hold her hand, did not wipe her tears. One day, they went all the way to Pennsylvania to eat hamburgers. It's been a day since they stood guard at the doors of loan sharks in London. It's been a day since they greeted everyone, from Germans to Americans. They traveled from country to country and complained about Turkey to the Westerners. But they didn't even bother to taste the meatballs and pastries of my Rumelian brothers. They even linked arms with terrorists, but they never once played paydushka with my Rumelian brothers. As much as they are interested in the criminals in prison, they have never been interested in the issues of millions of people whose hearts beat with Turkey.
They were everything, they took on every disguise, but never once did they take a local, national and conscientious stance, and they are doing the same today. They do not hesitate to walk arm in arm with the extensions of the separatist terrorist organization. They have no shame in doing business with FETO members. They do not hesitate to threaten our unity and solidarity with the Alevi-Sunni, Kurdish-Turkish videos they publish in the middle of the night, when there is nothing to do. They are not ashamed to humiliate our earthquake victims because they did not vote. They see no harm in embracing hate speech to protect their seats.
My brothers,
Do you know where they get their orders from? They get it from terrorists in Qandil. We take our orders from God and our nation, this is our difference. Instead of appearing before the nation with projects and works, they think they can get our people's votes with the politics of fear. However, whatever they do is in vain, because our nation knows them inside and out. Our nation knows very well how enthusiastic they are for fascism. Our nation sees that these will not bring any benefit to itself, the country, or its brothers in Rumelia.
May 14 was the first slap that those who underestimated our people's wisdom and foresight received from the nation, hopefully May 28 will be a milestone in which the unfinished work is completed together with you. As a nation, we will not give opportunity to those who see us injured and want to poison our medicine. We will not fall prey to the tricks of incompetent people who want to make the nation share in the defeat they suffered on May 14. We will never allow the merchants of discord and the merchants of hatred to sow discord among us and turn us against each other. We will not tarnish the ballot box. We will definitely not be complacent. We will never fall into the drunkenness of victory. On May 28, we will all run to the polls early and protect our will, democracy and future together.
Now, let me renew our conversation with you, are we ready? Let's stand up like this. With a very loud voice, let the whole of Türkiye hear it.
One nation… One flag… One homeland… One state…
We will be one… We will be big… We will be alive… We will be brothers… We will all be Turkey together…
I pray that God will help us. Thank you, long live, God bless you.
",2023-05-28,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won the election between 2 candidates.,before
Their Speech at the Istanbul Transportation Sector Meeting,2023-05-18,"

Dear Tradesmen Brothers,
Dear Istanbulites,
My Dear Cause and Travel Friends,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to thank our Istanbul Provincial Organization for allowing us to come together here today. Those who know our conversation with our tradesmen, especially our driver brothers, know that there is nothing different between us. We greet you sometimes at hall meetings, sometimes at taxi and minibus stops, and sometimes when we bump into each other in traffic. In these contacts, we chat, express our mutual affection, and then continue on our way.
Recently, while I was driving on the road, I saw a sign on the back of one of our shopkeepers' bread boats: ""If anyone can't tow, they should install an antenna."" Should those who cannot bear our conversation and love wear an antenna? However, they are so disconnected from their country and reality that they cannot receive even the clearest messages coming from the ballot box, and even try to reverse them, and an antenna is of no use to them. That's why we sent our İMECE satellite into space, maybe the signals they will receive from there will be useful for them to wake up and see the truth. Of course, we don't care what they do, what dirty deals, fights, or tricks they are involved in; We are minding our business.
Our nation went to the polls on May 14 and declared its will. By giving the majority in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to the People's Alliance with 322 deputies, it showed what kind of picture it wanted from the legislature. Although we had a 2 million 520 thousand lead over our closest rival in the presidential election and received 49.5 percent of the votes, the matter was left to the second round due to the system's 50 percent + 1 vote requirement. This will of our nation has a place in our heads. We believe that, with God's permission, our nation will entrust us with the Presidency again for 5 years with a record vote and rate in the second round. For this reason, we are already looking at what we can do to ensure that the works we have brought to our country are not left unfinished. We are looking at what we can do to further advance the services that will solve our nation's troubles, problems and problems. We are looking at what tools we can use and what relationships we can mobilize to increase Turkey's power in the world in its shadow and region.
Do you know why we are so sure of ourselves? Because we have no bargaining with anyone. We are only at the command of our Nation, we are its servants. We do not receive instructions like these from Kandil. We do not negotiate with extensions of the terrorist organization in dark rooms. We take refuge in our Lord and take instructions from our nation.
Currently, we are only seeking to bring works to our country. We work day and night to solve the problems of every segment of our nation, to meet their demands and to realize their expectations.
Think about it, as my esteemed Minister just stated, this... ""Don't worry, Turkey, there will be no wheels left on the road."" Beautiful.
My brothers,
My Minister just said, what would we be like if there was no Eurasia Tunnel? Our Martyrs Bridge makes our job easier, Fatih Sultan makes our job easier, but how would we be without the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge? How would we be without the Osman Gazi Bridge? I'm going further: How would we be without the Çanakkale Bridge?
We are preparing programs that will reflect the resources that emerge as Turkey grows, becomes stronger and richer, into the lives of each of our people. You have seen what we did after bringing Black Sea gas to our country. Did we deliver Black Sea gas to our people free of charge for a month? Have we announced to our people that we will give a 25 percent discount on the kitchen for a year? What's next now? Gabar. What will our people do from the moment we hopefully extract the Gabar oil? He will benefit. Gabar oil could not be extracted for years because of those terrorists with whom Kılıçdaroğlu was hand in hand. When we enrich the oil we found in Gabar with new discoveries and bring it to a certain level, we will do the same with fuel oil. We will relieve our people by reducing taxes and providing special subsidies to our tradesmen and farmers. We are taking similar steps on every issue, from minimum wage to civil servants' and pensions. We will build the Turkish century not by placing new burdens on our nation, but by alleviating the burden of our nation.
Dear brothers and sisters,
As always, you are among the people from whom we receive the greatest support in our struggle to build Turkey's century. Now I remembered a sign on the back of a vehicle that I saw on the road. This article said, ""Remember, if one day a weight falls on your shoulders, it will be my fault."" We have never forgotten, never neglected, never abused your responsibility. We stood by our drivers who earn their living behind the wheel, and all our other tradesmen who struggle to earn their living at their stalls. We are witnesses to your extraordinary efforts and sacrifices, especially during the epidemic and earthquake period. You have a great role in our country's development march and in our nation's ability to continue its life in peace and security.
Likewise, you know best the strong transportation infrastructure we have established in our country for 21 years, urban planning practices, and the tradesmen and craftsmen-friendly trade climate we have established. You are the direct addressee of the investments we make, from divided roads to highways, bridges and tunnels in the city. If only this living room could speak, friends, do you know who cleaned this Golden Horn? We. We completed this place during the presidency of Mr. Kadir Topbaş - may God have mercy on him. Look, we all benefit from this hall, I mean Justice and Development Party, CHP, there is no such distinction. Where did we do this? We did it for our nation, that is our difference.
While renewing a significant part of our country's vehicle stock, we paid most attention to facilitating access to commercial vehicles. Today, we are at your side with a Treasury-backed vehicle loan of up to 1.5 million lira through Halkbank. Last year alone, we prepared support packages worth 150 billion lira for our tradesmen. Thus, we supported approximately 400 thousand tradesmen with a loan of 146 billion lira. In line with the demands of our tradesmen, we recently introduced the opportunity to renew commercial vehicles without SCT, after approximately 7 years. By excluding our tradesmen, whose earnings are taxed in a simple manner, from Income Tax, we have provided a very important convenience to our 850 thousand tradesmen, including our taxi drivers.
Again, recently, we promised to eliminate the injustice in the number of premium days in retirement, which is one of the most important problems of our tradesmen. Accordingly, we reduced the number of premium days required for retirement for our small tradesmen from 9000 to 7200.
We met all the demands of our public bus operators in Istanbul through our Municipal Council Group.
In order to encourage our young people to start their own businesses, we do not collect taxes on their annual earnings of up to 150 thousand liras, and we also pay their insurance premiums.
As you can see, we do not speak our words into the air like some others, we do what we say. Hopefully, we will continue to be with you with many more good news and good news in the coming period. Every step taken in the construction of Turkey's century will be a new achievement for your safe, peaceful and prosperous future.
Two concepts are very important; trust and stability.
Young people, remember, we will win in such a way that no one will lose. In the past, many traps were set for our country and many games were played on our nation so that it could not take these steps. The reason for keeping Turkey out of the game was behind every calamity we experienced, from single-party fascism to coups, from the years of coalitions to the unleashing of terrorist organizations on us. They are our enemies because we disrupted this insidious game. If we had continued to pour the country's resources to London loan sharks and turned a blind eye to the division of our nation over discussions of origin, sect and disposition, believe me, there would be no one more valuable than us. But we only wanted God's consent, our nation's support, our people's blessings, and we worked for this. You see, when you put the country's resources at the disposal of the nation, roads are built, disasters are overcome, and the demands of all segments of society can be met. Behind this abundance lies working for the nation, fighting for the nation, shedding sweat for the nation.
My brothers,
We undoubtedly have shortcomings, and above all, the claim of inerrancy does not comply with our belief. But be sure of this: Our struggle for Turkey's growth and strengthening, and for the peace and prosperity of our nation, was sincere until the end. We were sincere while struggling with the dirty scenarios of tutelage. We were sincere when we brought centuries-old democracy and development initiatives to our country. We were again sincere against the plots of FETO traitors, which later became clear that they were a conspiracy, with the admission of the people they used. While we were fighting against the bloody attacks of terrorist organizations, we were also sincere in looking for solutions to end this issue peacefully. We were sincere when we challenged the bombs of tanks, planes and helicopters on July 15. We were sincere in implementing our own programs to prevent the attempts of economic hitmen to collapse our country with the support of their global bosses.
You were with us throughout this struggle. I thank my Lord a thousand times for making me a member, brother and friend of such a nation and such a community. Oh, what beautiful people you are, how grateful you are, how kind-hearted, rich-hearted you are, and your hearts beat with the love of your homeland and nation.
My brothers,
It is not for you to challenge the seven powers, we will take on the whole world if necessary. Turkey's May 14 elections have been one of the most important tests in our multi-party political life. For the first time in a long time, our country had an election with two alliances and two candidates. There is probably no need to explain how the coalition table alliance led by the People's Alliance and the CHP came into being. You know very well who supports the candidate in front of us and who gives way. Despite this, we all saw together how they went out of their way and how they made threats left and right when they were left behind by 2 million 520 thousand. The separatist terrorist organization and the party that backed it immediately announced their support for the CHP Chairman for the second round. Although the calculations inside the coalition table are a bit complicated and the atmosphere is a bit cloudy, at least they have secured the support of the separatist organization. To cover this up, Kılıçdaroğlu immediately started to lower the level in politics and polarize our people. The theater of saying goodbye was replaced in one day by the most primitive, most rude and most disgraceful form of fascism. However, no sheath is enough to cover this minaret. There is no politics by being stubborn with the nation, insulting the nation, and threatening the nation. There is no politics by insulting my earthquake-affected citizens. I will visit 6 earthquake provinces this Saturday-Sunday and next Tuesday.
You have seen what they do, not to mention the immoral, unscrupulous, inhumane campaigns carried out on social media. CHP municipalities and non-governmental organizations affiliated with this party are displaying all kinds of disgrace, from cutting aid to earthquake victims to collecting tents and evicting them from their places of stay. They evacuated the hotel they were staying in Tekirdağ, what kind of dishonesty is this? Until yesterday, they were promising free houses to our earthquake victims, today they are kicking our people out. When they are caught red-handed, they immediately try to divert the situation and save themselves. Imagine that they are attacking left and right with such passion in an election they just lost. God forbid, I don't even want to think about what they would have done if the election result had been the opposite.
We had 5 martyrs on the first day, 5 martyrs. What happened? Whatever you do, these martyrs will definitely be avenged in Cudi, Gabar, Tendürek and Bestler Creek.
Mr. Kemal, you will definitely part ways with these Kandil heirs with whom you were elbow to elbow and walked shoulder to shoulder, but it will be too late. I hope my nation will not give you this opportunity, my nation will finish this job on the 28th. Therefore, my request to my nation is this: I believe in you, let's finish the job quickly while the road is short. I hope we will achieve such a victory on May 28 that we can celebrate the conquest of May 29 together. We leave this immoral and inhumane attitude displayed by those who do nothing for the good of the country and the nation to the discretion of our nation.
Hopefully, we will be in earthquake zones this weekend, as we have always done since February 6; We will be there with Mr. Devlet on Saturday and Sunday, and we will ask about the well-being of our citizens there. We will see the works on site and give instructions for any deficiencies or malfunctions, if any. We will recover the earthquake area as soon as possible by opening Defne State Hospital.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
While we were implementing the works we brought to our country and the services we provided to our nation during our terms as Prime Minister and President, we never looked at who voted for us or who did not. Our only measurement is; Every member of this nation was deemed worthy of first-class service as our first-class citizen. Thank God, no one can present a contrary example in a single inch of our country, because we love this nation for the sake of God. Because we want this country, with its 81 provinces and 85 million citizens, to grow and become stronger for the future of our children. We have not tolerated any mistakes in this regard in the past, and we will not allow the slightest complacency from now on.
My brothers; We have only one flag. Does Kandil carry our flag? Do its extensions carry our flag? Our adhan is clear, do they have an adhan? Do they have a book? Do you have extensions? Aren't they the ones who raise our flag? So let's all shout together with enthusiasm so loudly that Kandil and its extensions can hear it too.
Are you ready?
One nation… One flag… One homeland… One state…
We will be one… We will be big… We will be alive… We will be brothers… We will all be Turkey together…
Stay healthy.

Their Speech at the 3rd Türkiye Youth Summit,2023-05-12,"

Dear Young People,
Dear Representatives of İş Academy and our Art World,
Dear Valued Guests,
Ladies, Gentlemen,
I greet you with all my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I am very pleased to be with you, my precious young brothers. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who brought our hearts together, helped us to satisfy our longings, and let us talk rub by rube.
From here, through you, I convey my greetings to all our young people all over our country and our heartland. From here, I send my love to all our young people who pray for us, whose eyes sparkle when Turkey is mentioned, and who are as much in love with Turkey as we are.
I hope that the Turkey Youth Summit will be successful and will be beneficial for our country, our nation and all our young people. Before moving on to the next part of the speech, I would like to express the construction of this magnificent hall in a few sentences.
This place was built during my term as Mayor. Above this was the only theater hall in Istanbul at that time, if I'm not mistaken, it was a hall with a capacity of 150 people. I said, we will demolish this place and build a more perfect and bigger one. And then the so-called artists started making speeches, saying that it would destroy, it wouldn't do. I said, not only that, we will also build the largest congress center in Istanbul. And we went 40 meters underground, including the parking lots of the place you see. Of course, the company that undertook this work then went 40 meters underground, including its car parks, and built the Istanbul Congress Center. But the place where this hall is located is about 20 meters deep, because there are now parking lots and so on underneath, and this was built as a hall for 3,800 people. But after these places were built, they could not say, ""This Mayor built this place, thank you, etc.""
Now, those so-called draftsmen who pass themselves off as artists continue to insult in the same way. Because believe me, they do not have a tree with nails in their lives for this country. They have no purpose other than making money with many immoral images. And now we are going to Sunday, and they continue to insult us with all kinds of lies and this and that. Let them insult you, but we, with the youth I see in front of me right now, are walking not to Sunday but to the grave.
Youth,
If you remember, we last hosted your representatives at the Presidential Complex 2 years ago. It is a great pleasure for me to embrace you again at the 3rd of our summit. I would like to thank each of you for your enthusiasm, your commitment to your promises, and your excitement that cannot fit into the living rooms. The power that drives us to run harder is this picture, this power. This is love that motivates us to work harder. This is the courage that makes us challenge seven worlds when necessary. As long as you stand firm by our side, no one can bend our wrist, God willing. I pray God bless you all.
My brothers,
I believe that the work and projects carried out under the theme of Turkey of a Strong Tomorrow will open horizons for our young people. I congratulate all of our brothers and sisters who contributed to the strong future of our country and who were deemed worthy of awards in the fields of culture, art, science, sports and technology this year. As the President of Turkey, we will give you the necessary support from now on, as we have done so far. We will support all institutions and organizations that strive to raise TEKNOFEST youth. We saw this booming youth at the 7th TEKNOFEST. More than 2.5 million young people who are curious about science, technology, research and questioning, and who love their country and nation flocked to TEKNOFEST.
Youth,
I have to say one thing, I have not become Prime Minister yet, we won the elections at that time, and I am traveling around Europe. Meanwhile, I asked for an appointment with my son Bush and visited America. And I said to them, you were going to give us UAVs, SIHAs, we are fighting against terrorism, what will happen? And he immediately called Condoleezza Rice and said, ""Give me the UAVs."" They gave us a UAV, but of course it came for 2 days. May God have mercy on him, at that time my late-born Özdemir Bayraktar - he was an extraordinary person - took the first step and initiated the establishment of today's UAVs and SIHAs. As some fraudsters state, he has never received a loan, land, land, anything like that from the state, and he never will.
At that time, he was not my in-laws, he was my friend. And then I told him the following: Of course, he is older than me, there was a 5-6 year difference between us, brother Özdemir, look, we, as the state, support those who make such investments, come and take advantage of these opportunities. He said no, I won't buy it. As a first step, he established UAVs on his own land. Of course, he was a different brain, he was also my old friend in politics, we walked the road together. Then with his children, with his wife, with his own wife, because his aunt was also a person who understood accounting and such things, he took the step and built the UAV, not enough, he also took the step of the SIHA. Meanwhile, of course, Selçuk Bey became our son-in-law.
Of course, all these, both the father and the children, were great minds, and while the work was going on, UAVs and SIHAs were not enough, Akıncı came. Of course, international orders also started to arrive. But with all this, he never received loans from state banks or others at these points. Akıncı was made, and of course the next step was Kızılelma. These were, of course, unmanned warplanes. They were all unique aircraft. Especially the Red Apple, of course it has been tested and so on, but the main point has not happened yet, as soon as it is done, it already has the ability to carry the bombs carried by the current F-16s. I think they've shot a shot about it right now and they're going to screen this shot as well. I said maybe it would arrive this evening, but I guess it didn't arrive this evening. Has it been published? Published.
And 2.5 million young people flocked to this year's TEKNOFEST. Now, young people, pay attention, I wonder why the opposition in this country is attacking Baykar? Many of our products have been showcased, from Akıncı to Kızılelma, from TOGG to Anka, I wonder why they digest and attack? This is how they attacked this Revolutionary car, which was also built by our Hodja Erbakan, may God have mercy on him. Our teacher built the Revolution car, and we built the car of the era. Of course, now they can't attack the cars of the era, they have nothing left to say. We said no matter what you do, you won't succeed, and they won't succeed.
Our young people of all ages have seen what they can achieve when they believe, work and dream. Almost all of them believed in their country, believed that they could succeed, and gained self-confidence every time they passed in front of the state-of-the-art products. We see that all our young people who attend TEKNOFEST have radically changed their horizons and their perspective on the world.
Especially the chains placed on the minds of those who condemned the children of this country to psychological captivity for years are being torn apart one by one. Every young person who says ""I can do it too if I work"" instead of emulating others is a great gain for our future. Instead of looking at strangers with admiration, every young person who has the awareness that ""if I believe, I too can succeed"" is a beacon shining into our future. Every young person we save from the corridors of social media and the yoke of global culture is the harbinger of our bright future.
We look at the work of our organizations that join forces in the Turkey Youth Non-Governmental Organizations Platform from this perspective. With your activities, you help our young people maintain their ties with their roots. You also contribute to the education of TEKNOFEST youth. You also support Turkey's future and its shaping. I thank each of you again for your efforts and efforts.
Of course, it is not a coincidence that those who attacked TEKNOFEST and those who targeted our voluntary organizations are the same circles. Those who want to offer Ataturk Airport to American companies are the ones who are disturbed by your activities. Those who do not hesitate to join arms with FETO and separatists and those who threaten our associations from the Parliament rostrum are the same groups. Now, those who support perverted structures such as LGBT and those who slander you are fed from the same source.
Dear Young People,
I have to be frank here; This CHP is pro-LGBT. This İYİ Party is pro-LGBT. This HADEP is pro-LGBT. Since those who walk with them cannot say no to them, they are also LGBT.
LGBT cannot infiltrate the AK Party, MHP cannot be infiltrated, LGBT cannot infiltrate the People's Alliance. Because we believe in the sanctity of the family institution. If there are no strong families, you cannot be a strong nation. This is where we get our strength from. As you know, we sent our constitutional amendment proposal, but of course we could not take the step when the election process started. God willing, our goal is to make this change after the election.
Those who inject pessimism into our youth every time they open their mouths and those who talk about our foundations and associations have the same world of mind. These are the enemies of democracy, national will and the values ​​of the nation. They are the enemies not only of civil politics but also of civil society. These are the volunteer legionnaires of the West and global capital among us. We have been fighting against these and the forces behind them for the last 21 years. We have never, ever bowed to the pressure of those who rely on tutelage, the marginals, and global focuses. We did not allow our non-governmental organizations to be intimidated by vile threats, intimidated by bullying, or intimidated by reputation assassinations. We tried to do what is best for our country, our nation and our youth, without deviating from the path we believe is right. We walked with determination, courage and determination in line with our goals and ideals, without taking our eyes off the horizon. Hopefully, we will continue to work with love in the coming period, saying there is no stopping, keep going. We will achieve this together with you. With your efforts and work, we will achieve greater success in the future.
Dear Young People,
My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
On May 14, we will hold one of the most critical elections in our country's history. You probably see the importance of these elections very clearly, especially in the statements coming from abroad and the messages on magazine covers. What do they say? “A Türkiye without Erdoğan” What did Erdoğan do to you? Ha, Erdoğan did something to them. Now Mr. Kemal is attacking Mr. Putin, he is attacking Russia, Kılıçdaroğlu... Biden said, ""Erdoğan must be defeated"", it is on the record. But you are helpless, pathetic. Because when Biden said so, I did not ask why Biden said so. However, I knew Biden long before you, we also had family meetings. But when you attack Putin now, I'm sorry, I won't appreciate it either. Because our relations with Russia are currently not inferior to our relations with America. So, when we look at the foreign trade volume, our foreign trade volume with it is more than with America, such a situation exists. But Mr. Kemal, you do not know or understand what state administration is. We meet all over the world. We know what state administration is, but you will learn these things, but that opportunity will not come to you. The people with me will not be of any use to you. One of the people with you was once my minister who dealt with the economy. We are in Davos and we are meeting with the IMF President in Davos. I said to the IMF President; You have 23.5 billion dollars receivable from Turkey, are you collecting your money? You do. Do you take it when the time comes? You are getting it. Take your money, but I am the Prime Minister of Turkey, you cannot interfere in Turkey's politics. At that time, Prime Minister, I saw that Bebecan would get angry and upset. I don't understand why he would get angry and angry, I guess he was disturbed by the way he rebuffed the President of the IMF like that. And this process continued with the IMF until 2013. In 2013, we paid the entire 23.5 billion - I say in dollars - and ended our relations with the IMF.
They were in the lobbies of the hotels. The speaker of the CHP, as well as the person who was the President of the so-called Central Bank for a while, I believe he is now a member of parliament, also met with IMF representatives. They also advise us to get help from the IMF. We said that our job is over, such a thing is out of the question, and we cut it off. We have not had a relationship with the IMF for 10 years. At that time, our Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves were 27.5 billion dollars. Now, if I am not mistaken, I did not get the final figure, but it is around 115 billion dollars. At one point during my term as Prime Minister, the foreign exchange reserves of our Central Bank reached up to 135 billion dollars, it will happen again, we will reach those figures again, we believe in this and we are strong in this regard, and we will prove it from now on. But 300 billion dollars will come to this gentleman from London's loan sharks, marijuana and heroin smugglers, and he will raise Turkey up with it.
What did the Western media do now? They gave up their work, they started to care about our elections as much as they did not care about their own, how much they love us. Things got so out of hand that everything that existed in the name of press ethical principles was trampled on. They display all kinds of disgrace, including pointing fingers at the nation and threatening the national will. Turkish politics is witnessing this with ugliness and shameful nastiness that it has perhaps never experienced before.
While the leaders of the terrorist organization attack us and our alliance with the statements they make every day, they openly ask for votes for someone. FETO members have turned into the advertising agency of Kemal and his partners.
They have reopened all the dirt they have brought to our country's politics. They have put into use all the inhumane, immoral and un-Islamic methods, from dignity executioners to tape conspiracies. They resort to every means, including threatening people's lives. They push all the buttons, including playing with society's nerve endings. They are supposedly teaching democracy and peace lessons to the nation, but they can take all kinds of action against their alliance partners just because their candidate, whom they praised so highly until yesterday, left the table for 3 days. They are so blinded that they don't even want to hear a different voice, let alone be objected to. They put pressure, threaten and blackmail everyone they come across, from their partners to politicians, from journalists to athletes, from bureaucrats to citizens on the street. If you ask, there is no democrat among them, there is no libertarian among them. If you ask, they will bring spring, they will bring peace, they will embrace the nation. If you ask, they will not interfere with anyone's business, culture, belief or lifestyle.
Are you going to tell us, Mr. Kemal, about the suffering that our daughters, including our children, are going through in this country because of their headscarves at the university gates? Even you are already one of them. What did you not do until you reached the Constitutional Court? If you ask, they will be the guarantee of everyone, from religious to secularists, but in practice, there is a completely different picture.
Think about it, I had to take my daughter, who was studying at an imam hatip school, from Istanbul and send her to another city. Why? Just because of the headscarf. We experienced these, we suffered these ordeals; Who are you deceiving? Wasn't it your Vice President that you took off your headscarf and let in in certain rooms at the university entrance? Who are you deceiving? You always kept these alive. Honesty when it comes to words, in reality lies and slander are the bottom line. When it comes to words, there is moralizing, but in reality there is lynching people. In words there is advanced democracy, in essence there is the most primitive form of fascism. We do not forget the persuasion rooms, Mr. Kemal.
We all saw the huge difference between words and substance during the election period. We all witnessed how the CHP mentality promises a dark future for our nation. We watched the trailer of Turkey, directed by them, together with 85 million people in the last 2 months. We have seen with our own eyes the dictatorial desires hiding behind the concepts of spring, peace and justice. Not only us, but all 85 million people, regardless of which political party they support, saw and followed these disgraces. Even though their worldview is different, I know very well that none of my citizens who love their country and nation approve of what is happening. I believe that you, our young people, have deciphered the dark faces and real intentions behind the masks.
I want you to protect both your own future and the future of your country on May 14. I especially request you to protect the ballot boxes.
Dear Young People,
Neither in our 40 years of political life nor in our 21 years of government, we have never behaved like these, we have never intervened in anyone's lifestyle or way of life. We did not ban any thought, no matter how contrary it was. We did not seek to liquidate our competitors through reputational assassinations. We did not seek our way to power through secret collaborations with terrorist organizations. We did not stand together with those who acted according to the instructions from Qandil. We obeyed our Lord's command and walked on this path with our nation. We have always been honest, transparent, and friendly towards our nation.
We have expanded the rights and freedoms of all segments of society. Before us, there were headscarf and dress code bans in this country, and we lifted them. It was being done unfairly to Imam-Hatip schools and vocational high schools, so we ended it. People could not practice their beliefs freely, we changed them.
Terrorist organizations were not allowing our citizens to breathe, we crushed their heads. We entered their lairs in Cudi, we entered their lairs in Gabar, we entered their lairs in Tendürek, we entered their lairs in Bestler Creek, and if our citizens in the Southeast and the East can live freely now, it is thanks to us.
Our democracy was sluggish, but we strengthened it. The state was looking down on its citizens, we established a new understanding. Foreign countries were constantly adjusting and directing us, we said stop. Apart from these, we have brought our country to a freer, more prosperous and economically stronger position in every field compared to 21 years ago. Yes, we increased the national income per capita from 3 thousand 600 dollars to 10 thousand 600 dollars. Despite all the hype, we have only pursued service politics since 2002.
My brothers,
Now our goal is to grow Turkey, but we will do this together with you, our youth. I will be attending a joint television broadcast shortly, so let's make a final agreement with you. Are you ready for this? Then, young people, let's stand up together. Since we are ready, let's use our expressions like this.
Youth; Do we say no stopping on May 14, keep going? Do we say that we will continue with the right steps on May 14? Are we saying right now for the Turkish century on May 14?
May God be pleased with you and may our path be clear.
And I hope we can experience this unity of hearts together on Sunday evening.
I entrust you all to God.
Thank you, bless you.

Their Speech at the Hak-İş General Assembly,2023-05-11,"

Dear Managers of our HAK-İŞ Confederation,
Dear Members of the HAK-İŞ Family,
Dear Working Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. Through you, I offer my love and respect to our fellow workers and all our employees.
I am very pleased to be with you on the occasion of the 15th Ordinary General Assembly Meeting of our HAK-İŞ Confederation. I hope that the General Assembly will be beneficial for the HAK-İŞ community, our working world and our nation. I would like to thank HAK-İŞ for its determined efforts, democracy, freedom and justice struggle for nearly 47 years. I congratulate everyone who has sweated, struggled and contributed to the work under the umbrella of HAK-İŞ since its establishment. Again, on this occasion, I would like to remember with mercy our brothers who worked at HAK-İŞ, but who are no longer among us and have passed away into eternity.
Those brothers, whom we see as the pioneers of our labor struggle, have a very important role in Turkey reaching today. HAK-İŞ contributes not only to our workers' gains in working life, but also to the growth and development of our country's economy. In the last 21 years, if Turkey has brought its national income from 236 billion dollars to 1 trillion dollars, if it has grown at an average rate of 5.5 percent every year, if it has become the 11th largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power, if it has increased its employment to nearly 32 million despite the increase in the number of workforce, if it has increased its exports by 36 million. If it has increased its income from billion dollars to 255 billion dollars, in short, if it has achieved the success of the century in every field from industry to tourism, from defense to production, the hidden heroes of this are my workers and laboring brothers.
Turkey has come to this day not only with the blood of our martyrs, but also with the sacred and blessed sweat of our workers. I pray God bless you all. On behalf of my country and my nation, I would like to express my gratitude to each of you, to all my brothers and sisters in the presence of HAK-İŞ.
My brothers,
HAK-İŞ is also our union in terms of the mass it represents. We see ourselves as a member of the great working family of 16 million in our country. I am the son of a father who earned his family's income by being a captain. I am a brother of yours who worked as a worker at IETT in his youth. I am someone who later went into business, worked as a tradesman, and sought his livelihood in trade. I know very well what it means to wake up at dawn, to wait for the bus in the cold of winter, to go to work among crowds, and to eat at a table spread on newspapers. Thank God, I know very well how valuable and how fruitful the money earned with hard work is. I know very well how our working brothers endure difficulties to bring bread to their homes.
These values, which we learned from our family and our environment, and which we later experienced by living in our personal lives, have always guided us. We kept in mind where we came from. We were not among those who denied their past or turned their backs on their roots. We carried out our struggle to serve our country and nation through politics under the guidance of this knowledge and this memory. We have always tried to do you justice since our office as Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
Remember, the most important issue of our workers before us was May 1st, almost every May 1st, incidents would happen, sometimes blood would be shed. Marginal organizations and illegal structures would also exploit this situation. We put an end to this in 2008 and declared May 1 first as Labor and Solidarity Day and then as a public holiday. We did this ourselves. In addition, we have taken very important steps in terms of organization, union rights, worker health and safety. The Occupational Health and Safety Law we enacted is a historic reform in this field.
By gathering social security institutions under one roof, we ensured that everyone could receive the same quality service, especially in the field of health. We put an end to discriminatory and oppressive practices by changing the dress code, which was a legacy of the coup period.
The issue of wages was one of the areas we were most sensitive to. What was the minimum wage when we took office? It was 184 liras, which corresponds to 126 dollars in dollars. What is the minimum wage today? It was 8 thousand 500 liras, which is approximately 440 dollars in dollar terms.
Another example is fuel prices, which the opposition constantly talks about. In 2002, the liter price of gasoline was 1.5 lira, the minimum wage could buy 110 liters of gasoline. Although the barrel price of oil increased from 25 dollars to 77 dollars in the intervening years, today 410 liters of gasoline can be purchased with the minimum wage. It is possible to extend similar examples to many topics.
The increase in minimum wage and other wages during the period of our new governments has increased purchasing power not only numerically but also in real terms.
My brothers,
Even just the minimum wage example shows the importance our government attaches to its workers, civil servants and retirees. When we set out, we said that we would not subject our employees to inflation. Thank God, we have always remained true to this promise in the last 21 years. Regardless of the global economic outlook or Turkey's financial conditions, we did not subject our employees to inflation.
We stood by all segments of our society, from retirees to civil servants, from disabled people to relatives of martyrs and veterans. We ensured that our entire nation received the share they deserved from the added value that emerged as our economy grew. In fact, we maintained this sensitivity despite the serious troubles our country experienced, natural disasters, global economic crises and conflicts in our region.
For example, during the Covid-19 epidemic, we prioritized protecting our people's jobs as well as their health. Despite all the pressure from the opposition, we did not give an opportunity to those in the economy who wanted to shut down our country. We showed the same attitude in the global economic crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. We kept the wheels turning uninterrupted with the support and incentives we provided in a wide range. We never neglected growth through investment, employment, production, exports and current account surplus, and we applied this model. We also encouraged production and investment with our low interest policy. While the world is chasing high interest rates, pay attention, we have strived to constantly reduce the interest rate and reduced it to 8.5%. Why? So that those who need to invest can come and invest, because if there is investment, there will be employment, and if there is employment, unemployment will gradually decrease. We have seen the positive results of all this in many areas, especially exports and employment.
If we had succumbed to the pressure of the opposition in those critical days when the wheels of the world stopped and supply chains were broken, we would be in a very bad place now. When we look back today, we understand better what a wise decision we made.
Particularly in the United States, recent bank failures, one after the other, reveal the risks of high interest rates. The situation in America is clear, thank God we have not encountered such a situation. We achieved this despite the pressure of the opposition and the insidious guidance of mandated economists disguised as advice.
With our balanced attitude in the Russia-Ukraine war, we protected Turkey from entering a vortex that would end in disaster.
85 million of our workers and laboring brothers have also benefited from our country's policies that prioritize its own interests and human life.
Our government continued to protect the rights and laws of its citizens even after the February 6 earthquakes, which were described as the disaster of the century. Do you know what the earthquake's cost to our country's economy is, according to calculations? It exceeds 100 billion dollars. Normally, no country in the world, no matter how developed, can cope with such a great disaster. But on the 90th day of the earthquake, we completely removed the debris and installed 837 thousand tents and 100 thousand containers. In addition, while we started the construction process of 142 thousand residences and village houses, we actually laid the foundations of 59 thousand of them. While carrying out all the work in the earthquake zone, we met the demands of 2 million 250 thousand brothers waiting for retirement age.
We increased the minimum pension to 7 thousand 500 liras and holiday bonuses to 2 thousand liras. We are working to improve the situation of our retirees who receive wages above this amount. With the opening of the new Assembly, we will hopefully make our citizens who receive a pension of more than 7 thousand 500 liras happy.
In addition, by bringing our Black Sea gas to our country, we gave the good news to our people that this month will be completely free and 25 cubic meters will be free for 1 year.
Again, during this period, we took many strategic steps, from TOGG hitting the roads to our Anadolu Ship, to the arrival of fuel rods to our Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, to our national combat aircraft Kaan leaving the hangar. We can add many more good news to this list, including the opening of the Zigana Tunnel and the discovery of oil in Gabar with a production capacity of 100 thousand barrels per day. In conclusion; We both healed the wounds of the earthquake and brought our country step by step closer to its goals.
My brothers,
The latest good news we give to our employees is the public collective labor agreements signed the other day. With the protocol made, we not only increased the minimum wage of approximately 700 thousand brothers and sisters, but also increased it by 45 percent, including the welfare share. Thus, we increased the lowest public worker wage from approximately 12 thousand lira to over 21 thousand lira. I hope that this collective agreement will be beneficial to our public workers and institutions again.
Now we have a salary regulation for our civil servants. According to the law, the salary increase rates of civil servants are determined in January and July. As you know, we introduced an increase in the welfare share in addition to the inflation difference in the salary increases given to civil servants. There was no such application before. At the beginning of the year, we increased the salaries of public officials by 30 percent in total by adding a 13.5 percent welfare share. Thus, in 2022, we increased the minimum civil servant salary from 392 lira to approximately 12 thousand lira, an increase of 136 percent in real terms. Now we are taking another step in July, we will regulate the lowest civil servant salary so that it is not lower than the lowest public worker salary. As is the case for public workers, we will increase the minimum wage to 15 thousand liras and make a similar increase in terms of inflation and welfare shares. Thus, the minimum civil servant salary will reach 22 thousand liras. These increases in civil servant salaries will automatically be reflected on retirees. We gave our Minister the necessary instructions to complete this work by July, which is the legal date.
We are determined to protect wage justice and labor peace. Another step we will take in the new legislative period, as it requires legal regulation; It will be aimed at our civil servants who have reached the first degree but cannot receive 3600 additional indicators. We will ensure that all our civil servants who are ranked first degree and meet the conditions can benefit from the right to 3600 additional indicators.
May our civil servants rest their hearts at ease and be of good cheer. Let them continue to trust us and believe in their Government. We do not violate the rights of any of our employees, nor do we allow them to be defeated.
No one should listen to the delusions of someone who has many scandals in his past, from bankrupting SSK to making his grandchild insured. As you know, they said everything from promising to distribute free tractors to farmers in the last election to making transportation, milk, water, in short, life free. Were tractors given to farmers or were they? We can give, but they can't. In fact, Kemal made promises of honor and decency not to play with anyone's money in the municipalities they won, but they did not keep any of them. Even though they did not do a proper job for the benefit of the nation, they dragged the municipalities into debt. As if it wasn't enough that they had broken all the promises they made regarding their honor, they continued to grin shamelessly when they were reminded of these. They think that our nation does not see this hypocrisy. If you want, let's answer these with Ziya Pasha's famous phrase: ""The most unexpected discovers the secrets of the innermost. Do you think everyone is blind and the world is stupid? Our nation will hold all of these to account when they come to the ballot box. Even the disgrace experienced during this two-month election period is enough to see their true face.
I wholeheartedly believe that the HAK-İŞ family, with whom I have been with us in every struggle, will do what is necessary on May 14, one of the most critical elections of our country.
With these thoughts, I wish HAK-İŞ's 15th Ordinary General Assembly to be beneficial once again. I pray that God will help you and I greet you all with love and respect.

"Their Speech at the Opening Ceremony of Konya Karapınar Solar Power Plant, Bozkır Dam, Abdülhamit Han Street and Other Projects",2023-05-02,"

We love Konya very much. We started our journey with Konya, we came to this day with Konya, and our love continues the same.
Konya, the city of loyalty, Konya, the city of solidarity, Konya, the city of national will, Konya, unique in the world. I greet you once again with longing and affection.
Today, once again, I greet Konya, the capital of capitals, Konya, the city of Mevlana, Konya, the city of saints, saints, and hearts burning with the love of God, with respect and affection. Yes, we come from Antalya and there were more than 100 thousand friends in Antalya. But now the number I received in Konya, I am saying the official figure, 140 thousand, thank God, there are now in the square. What love is this, O Lord, what love is this. So, the one who runs beyond his love... If you fall in love, you will find something in return.
And when we see this area right now, wow. And I see the banners are written. Look, a young man opened an interesting banner. Do you know what it says: ""The path can be walked with those who take the command from God, not from the mountains."" Now, where do they, along with those around Kemal, get their orders? He gets it from the terrorists in Qandil, right? We also receive the order from God. And are we ready to bury those who received the order from the mountain on May 14? Are we ready for this? I have no doubt about this anyway. I hope Konya will teach this the necessary lesson on May 14. Young people unfurled another banner: “Seven dissimilar people united with each other, you cannot walk seven meters with each other. They said, ""Let the Turkish century begin, directly with the Chief against the seven powers.""
My brothers,
Today, once again, I respectfully salute the young people of Konya, whose eyes I am fascinated by, its hard-working farmers, its industrialists who broke export and employment records, and my sisters who carry all the nobility of being from Konya.
How beautifully the poet says;
""Love for God is like the sun that never sets, Konya's
It is the cause of the saints, the cause of Konya
Knowledge and wisdom sprout like crops in the soil
The water and air of Konya make the ignorant perfect.
From Konevi, Mevlana, many saints and saints
Konya enjoys its blessings day and night.
Khans are the city of holy mothers who gave birth to khans.
Konya's dream cannot fit into centuries and millennia.”
I thank God for bringing us together with Konya once again. I thank God for allowing us to embrace my brothers from Konya again after 6 months. I am very pleased to be with you, the beautiful people of Konya, whose love, cause and dream are God and reality.
Thank God, I see before me a Konya that does not fit into the squares. I see a Konya that is preparing to write an epic again on May 14th. In this square, I see a Konya that protects its will, its future and its 21-year achievements. I would like to express my gratitude to each of you, on behalf of myself and my nation, for your loyalty to the covenant, your love and affection. May God preserve our brotherhood. I pray that our companionship will last forever.
Now I'm asking here, are we ready? Konya; Do we say no stopping on May 14, keep going? Do we say that we will continue with the right steps on May 14? Are we saying right now for the Turkish century on May 14?
This suits Konya, the capital of the Seljuks. This suits Konya, whose land is honored by never-setting suns like Sadreddin Konevi, Hazrat Mevlana, and Şems-i Tabrizi. Of course, this suits Konya, the city of our late Erbakan Hodja, where knowledge, wisdom and knowledge flourish in every corner. May God be pleased with you. No good comes from what Konya says no. With God's permission, evil will not contaminate what Konya says yes to.
Hopefully, Konya will be the guarantee of the Turkish century as it is the symbol of our existence, unity and well-being in Anatolia. Dear
People of Konya, My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As you know, we experienced one of the biggest natural disasters of the century on February 6. Especially the 7.6 magnitude Elbistan earthquake was felt very seriously in Konya. As soon as we received the news of the earthquake, we mobilized our municipalities along with all institutions of our state.
Now I want to say something in particular here; We quickly dispatched the teams of our Konya Metropolitan Municipality and district municipalities to neighboring provinces. We transferred Hatay, which suffered the most destruction in the earthquake, to Konya. Our municipalities from Konya have carried out works that we are truly proud of. They supported the earthquake victims in all their needs, from infrastructure to superstructure, from soup kitchens to tent and container city installation. Put the actions of all the opposition municipalities on one side of the scale, and put the services provided by Konya to the region on the other side, and Konya will outweigh all of them. Konya Metropolitan Municipality Mayor especially followed the situation. Our municipalities gave lessons to the opposition and taught them how to serve the nation. Konya once again showed all of Turkey what volunteer municipalism means.
I would like to congratulate all our municipalities who are trying to heal the wounds instead of showing off and advertising. On behalf of my nation, I would like to thank the people of Konya for their compassionate support of our disaster victims. Hopefully, we will recover the earthquake area as soon as possible, with unity of hand and heart. On the one hand, we continue to carry out the traces of the disaster and, on the other hand, to implement vision projects that will bring our nation to its dreams.
Now my brothers; In order to share with our nation the joy of the domestic gas we discovered and brought ashore in the Black Sea, did we make all natural gas bills in residences, including heating, free for the first month?
In addition, we deduct the amount of natural gas consumption corresponding to the kitchen and water heating needs of the residences from the bills for 1 year. We published the Presidential decree and decision regarding this good news in the Official Gazette yesterday. I wish good luck and good luck to all members of our nation.
Now, Mr. Kemal went to Zonguldak yesterday. He tells lie after lie to my miner brothers in Zonguldak. Well, in Zonguldak, there is Filyos right there, we extracted Sakarya natural gas there, Mr. Kemal. You thought it wasn't going to come out, you were wondering where it was. Here it is, we burned natural gas and started sending it to our citizens' homes.
If we promise, we will do it. We promised and we did it. We delivered our UAV ship, TCG Anadolu, which is the flagship of our Navy, to our Naval Forces in the past weeks. We started the deliveries of TOGG, our domestic electric vehicle that our nation has been waiting with hope for 60 years. We delivered our new Altay tank to our Armed Forces for testing. Yesterday, we took our national combat aircraft Kaan out of the hangar and had it built on the runway.
Did you watch? Do you like it? These are seriously scaring some people. There are those who are afraid inside, there are those who are afraid beyond the water, but mostly in Cudi, Gabar, Tendürek, Bestler Creek. As we bury the terrorists there, some people inside become disturbed. What does someone in Kandil say? He says, look, it's very interesting, the AK Party shot us in caves. What were we going to do, say, are you doing well? What if you will martyr my Mehmet and we will say goodbye to you? We will continue to avenge Mehmet until the end.
You are welcome, Mr. Kemal, to have meetings with you behind closed doors. Next to him is Davutoğlu, Bebecan, Karamollaoğlu and of course Ms. Meral, she leaves the table and goes away, then comes again, goes again. , we are fed up with you now, there are people under the table, that was not enough, now they have taken 2 mayors with them and they continue on their way with them. But while they are walking with those in Qandil, we are walking with the People's Alliance.
As the People's Alliance, are we preparing for May 14? Main stage, are we ready? Our women, our women's branches, are we ready? Guys, are we ready? May God bless you. I believe you will explode the ballot boxes.
Our country's first supersonic jet aircraft, Hürjet, made its flight. We took off our heavy class attack helicopter, Atak-2, for the first time. After Kızılelma, our Anka-3 unmanned aircraft took its first walk. In addition, we have taken many other historical steps, from the launch of our İMECE satellite to the identification of Turkey's first space travelers.
Do you know how many people, mostly young people, watched TEKNOFEST, the world's number one aviation and technology festival? We held it with a participation of over 2.5 million as of last night. Of course, we didn't stop there, let's watch briefly what we did in 20 years with a video.
My brothers,
We are working diligently to save Turkey from foreign dependence on energy. We are concerned about making the underground and aboveground riches that our Lord has given to our country available to our nation. Despite the opposition's criticism, we bought our drilling ships for this reason and started natural gas exploration for this reason. Currently, we have 4 drilling ships and two seismic research ships, we are now self-sufficient. These are our ships that belong only to ourselves, not from outside. We are building the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant for this purpose and as of now, we meet 10 percent of all our needs in Akkuyu and of course it has a second unit, a third unit and a fourth unit. It is not enough, I hope we will build the second nuclear power plant with the continuation of our power, we will probably build it in Sinop. Because Türkiye will no longer be an energy needer, but an energy exporter.
This is why we are increasing the share of solar and wind in our energy basket. Where will we go today where there are giant energy panels? To Karapınar. That's the size of how many football fields? We will tell you all about them in a little while and we will see where the panels of that huge power plant are located. And where did this happen? To Konya.
This is why we attach importance to processing the boron mine ourselves. We are opening oil wells in different parts of our country for this purpose. Thank God, we are now seeing the positive results of all these steps we have taken, one by one. Just as we foiled the lie that they find gas before every election with the Black Sea gas, we will continue to disappoint those who slander our energy moves with new good news.
We are determined to alleviate the century-old longing of our nation, which looks around and sighs, especially about oil. Thank God, we have now started to produce oil from wells that were previously poured with concrete because there was no oil, and from areas that had to be abandoned due to terrorism. As Turkey, we made one of the 10 biggest discoveries made on land in the world last year. Do you know where our country's daily production, which was approximately 40 thousand barrels 5-6 years ago, has doubled? It reached 80 thousand barrels per day.
Now I want to share a new good news with you. We found oil with a daily production capacity of 100 thousand barrels in Cudi, Gabar. Do you know what this means? O terrorists, we will bury you in those oil wells, we will bury you. This oil reserve, 20 kilometers away from Cizre, is of very high quality. We will be able to increase the oil we found at a depth of 2,600 meters underground to a production capacity of 100 thousand barrels with the 100 wells we will drill in the region. We have already started to ship the oil we received from the first well to refineries for processing.
Is there any doubt that this oil reserve, which alone will meet 1/10 of our daily consumption, will be for the benefit of our country and nation? No. We are also expecting new good news from the same region, okay? We named our well in Gabar after our martyr teacher Aybüke Yalçın, who was vilely murdered by the separatist organization, is it okay? Rest in peace. May God make him a neighbor to his Beloved Habib.
We named our other well, which we discovered in the same region before and produces 9 thousand barrels of oil per day, after our explosives expert petty officer, the martyr Esma Çevik.
Our new field, the area where our martyr Aybüke Yalçın-1 well is located, will hopefully provide more oil alone than produced in our entire country. Thus, we are taking a new step towards our country's energy independence with a daily oil production of 180 thousand barrels for now.
Look, we don't even talk about the total value of our reserves anymore. Otherwise, the value of our new discovery in Gabar reaches 10 billions of dollars. The value of our Black Sea gas is expressed in hundreds of billions of dollars.
What does Mr. Kemal say? He was going to bring 300 billion dollars from loan sharks in London. Ula Mr. Mr. Kemal, what do I say, what do you say? He was going to bring in 300 billion dollars from loan sharks. Mr. Kemal, look, this is money, this is it, Sakarya natural gas, Gabar, this is money. Now, however, we continue on our way with confident steps, we will continue. We are not looking for the source in loan sharks, we are looking for the value of our country itself, we are looking for it in our own lands, we are looking for it in our own riches.
Our only concern is; To maximize the contribution of our discoveries and investments to our country's energy independence. Because, just like the defense industry, energy independence is a condition of giving up the true freedom of countries and nations. For this reason, we cannot be proud of every energy source we have discovered.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I especially congratulate our Ministry of Energy and Turkish Petroleum, our engineers and workers who have signed this historical success. On this occasion, I once again commemorate our teacher Aybüke Yalçın, who was martyred by separatist scoundrels, and all our martyrs.
In fact, with these discoveries, we understand much better why the separatist terrorist organization haunts our country. You know, we have always wondered why oil is gushing out right across our country's borders, but not in our own lands. It turns out that it is not that there is no oil coming from our country's lands, it turns out that not getting oil from our country's lands means that our hands and feet are tied by the terrorist organization and international oil companies. It turns out that no tricks or traps were left for us to prevent us from benefiting from the oil fields we live on. After the discovery in Gabar, do we understand better why some people in this country do not want terrorism to end?
We understand much better why the imperialist powers transferred so much weapons and money to the PKK and its extensions in Syria, and why they want to surround our country with a terror corridor. We understand much better why, for no apparent reason, someone targets UAVs, UCAVs, which are our most important force in the fight against terrorism, and the companies that produce them. Yes, the discussions about Ataturk Airport are not a coincidence, nor are those who talk about touching UAVs and SIHAs innocent, nor is it without reason that the leaders of the terrorist organization openly support those who say these, nor is it in vain that the extensions of the separatist organization go from city to city and beg for votes for Kemal. All of these are just moves by those who want to leave Turkey out of the energy race.
If you want, let's take a look at who the candidate of the coalition, which is now confused about whether it is the 7th, 9th or 11th party, is working with and watch the video.
With God's permission, we will not fall into this trap. We will not consent to our country being pushed out of energy competition. We will not allow the rights of our nation and the Turkish Cypriots to be violated. We will not allow terrorist organizations, subcontractors of the imperialists, to come between us and our underground and surface resources. We will definitely remove the scourge of terrorism from Turkey's agenda. We will defeat anyone and overcome every obstacle that will prevent us from putting our country's underground and aboveground riches at the disposal of our nation. The Turkish century is the name of this good news, this is the symbol of determination, this is the symbol of this struggle.
Are you ready?
Konya, are you with us especially in this struggle?
Konya, are you with us on this journey?
Konya, are you with us in this construction and revival movement?
I believe in you, I trust in you, God first, I have no doubt that you will explode these ballot boxes on May 14.
My brothers,
We are all mortal in this world, none of us know what we will be tomorrow or what we will be tested with. Our Lord says so in the Surah Al-Mulk; “ellezî halakal mevte vel hayâte li yebluvekum eyyukum ahsenu amelâ ve huvel azî zul gafur.” Death, what is life to us? It is a means of testing. Let's see which of us will be tested more accurately? Our aim is to serve our nation with love until the command of God is fulfilled.
And let's not forget this: It is not clear where and how we will die. We are neither seeking office, nor political fortune, nor seats. Remember, we came to this nation not to be masters, but to be servants. We have only one goal, and that is to receive your blessings. It means leaving behind works that will be remembered fondly. We wouldn't change anything in this world for a heartfelt prayer of God's blessing from Konya. With this sensitivity, we have been serving Konya and all of Turkey with love, day and night, for 21 years.
We have made a public investment of 168 billion lira in Konya in the last 21 years.
We built 9 thousand 33 new classrooms in education. We added 4 new universities, two of which are state universities.
We opened higher education dormitory buildings with a capacity of 28 thousand people in youth and sports. We built 114 sports facilities, including a stadium.
We transferred resources worth 8.5 billion lira to our citizens in need in social assistance.
In health, we built 108 health facilities, 34 of which are hospitals, with 3,280 beds. Among these, we also have Konya City Hospital with 1250 beds.
We implemented 28 thousand 181 housing projects in environment and urban planning. Now, with my first house, we are building 7,655 houses, with my first workplace, we are building 500 workplaces for our tradesmen, and with my first land, we are providing land with ready infrastructure for 55 thousand houses. We have completed 10 of our 18 national garden projects in Konya, and we continue the construction of the remaining ones.
In transportation, we increased the length of the divided road we took over from 167 kilometers to 1269 kilometers. We put the Ankara-Konya and Konya-Karaman high-speed train lines into operation. Work on our KonyaRay project, which will reduce the 1-hour journey by half, and Necmettin Erbakan University, the new high-speed train station, and the Meram rail system line, continues. We built a terminal building for our airport with an annual capacity of 3 million passengers.
We built 25 dams, 2 drinking water facilities, 76 irrigation facilities, 41 ponds, 6 underground storage facilities and 4 hydroelectric power plants in Konya in agriculture and forestry. With the blue tunnel project, we brought together the fertile lands of Konya with the abundance of water. With our irrigation projects, we opened 1.1 million decares of agricultural land in Konya to irrigation, providing an annual agricultural income increase of 3.5 billion lira to our farmers. We will irrigate a total of 721 thousand decares of land with our 11 irrigation facilities under construction. We provided agricultural support worth 17 billion lira to our Konya farmers.
In industry and technology, we established 3 new organized industrial zones, 3 industrial zones, 2 technoparks, 2 research and development centers and a design center.
Of course, there are people who are unaware of what is going on in this country. What does the organized industrial zones say? He says we will establish technology high schools. Who said this? Mr. Kemal. Dear Mr. Kemal, we have already established vocational training schools in all organized industrial zones in our country. And when will you learn to speak correctly? Mr. Kemal, we increased the number of apprentices and journeymen in our vocational training centers from 159 thousand to 1 million 400 thousand. He also says that he will provide insurance for these students. We already insure our students in vocational education; May God correct you. On top of that, we pay 30 percent of the minimum wage to our apprentices in vocational training centers and 50 percent to our journeymen, Mr. Kemal. What does our Lord say? They have eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear, tongues that do not speak, because their hearts are sealed.
My brothers,
Either they have no idea, or even though they know, they are trying to confuse people with lies. Our brothers and sisters who work there and are educated know best what we do in industry and vocational education.
In terms of energy, by supplying natural gas to Konya and its 20 districts, we have provided natural gas to 80 percent of the provincial population. Today, we are adding new links to this investment chain.
We are putting into service 17 items with a total investment cost of 890 million liras in the field of environment and urban planning.
We are officially commissioning Akören District Integrated Hospital, headman's buildings, and 171 workplaces in Karapınar Meke Industrial Site. We are officially opening 12 agricultural and irrigation projects, including the Konya Bozkır Dam. We are officially putting into service the road works completed by our highways in Bozkır and Hadim, and the schools and hostels built by our Ministry of National Education in 7 different districts. Today, we present to your use the roads, gardens, social facilities, fields, parks, service buildings, neighborhood and headman's mansions that our metropolitan and district municipalities have brought to our city.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
With all this, we are officially opening 74 items, services and projects with a total investment cost of 6 billion lira. Of course, our biggest investment today is the solar power plant that we established in Karapınar, on an area of ​​20 thousand decares, with an investment of 1 billion dollars. This solar power plant with a power of 1350 megawatts, established by Kalyon Energy, will produce electricity to meet the annual electricity needs of 2 million people. This facility has the title of being the world's leading power plant and the largest power plant in Europe and our country in this field. Some people show their ignorance on this issue, like everything else, by asking why energy is not produced from the sun. We hope that the faces of those who think they can produce electricity with false winds will turn a little red when they come to Karapınar and see this facility.
I hope that all these investments will be beneficial to our city and to you, my brothers and sisters from Konya. I congratulate all our ministries, municipalities, companies and employees who contributed to the construction of these works.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Dear Konya residents,
May 14 is very important for all these services and investment moves to continue, we will work hard for that, right? We'll go door to door, right? Because Mr. Kemal and his partners say at every opportunity that they have come not to build but to destroy, not to build but to destroy, not to encourage but to threaten.
But O Kandil, you have no flag, you have no adhan, you have no homeland; We know your extensions. With God's permission, this nation will teach the necessary lesson to those who are stateless, without adhan and without the Quran on May 14th.
Are we ready to go door to door on May 14? Are we ready to leave no Konya resident unreached by May 14? Are we ready to conquer hearts once again by May 14? May God bless you all.
May God always make our brotherhood, conversation and companionship permanent.
Now we will renew an important covenant, are we ready Konya?
One nation… One flag… One homeland… One state…
We will be one… We will be big… We will be alive… We will be brothers… We will all be Turkey together…
I hope that the works we have opened will be beneficial to Konya. I wholeheartedly congratulate those who brought these investments to our city. I would like to thank Kalyon company on behalf of myself and my nation.
I greet each of you with love and respect and entrust you to God.
Stay healthy.

Their Speech During Their Visit to TEKNOFEST,2023-04-29,"

Dear Brother Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan,
My Brother Abdulhamid Dibeybe, Prime Minister of Libya,
Dear Istanbulites,
Ladies, Gentlemen,
Dear participants of TEKNOFEST, valuable young people; I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection.
Mashallah, this year Istanbul TEKNOFEST is another beautiful one and through you, I send my greetings to all the young hearts in the 81 provinces of our country. Once again, I greet with love all our young people and young brothers from all over our heartland. I am very pleased to be with you at TEKNOFEST, the world's number 1 aviation, space and technology festival. I would like to welcome our young people who came to TEKNOFEST from different cities of Istanbul and Turkey to our Istanbul.
I would especially like to thank the President of Azerbaijan, my dear brother and friend Ilham Aliyev, along with his spouses, for their participation. Likewise, I would like to thank my brother Dibeybe, Prime Minister of Libya. We are with you in the 7th edition of TEKNOFEST, whose fame extends beyond the borders of our country. TEKNOFEST, which I organized for the first time in 2018, has thankfully turned into a brand in its field. Last year, we experienced the joy of TEKNOFEST with our dear Azerbaijani youth in Baku. We came together with young people who are interested in technology, defense industry and science in different provinces of our country, from Samsun to Gaziantep. We are holding our technology festival this year first in Istanbul and then hopefully in Ankara.
I hope that TEKNOFEST, where concrete examples of our national technology move are exhibited, will be beneficial to our country, our nation and you, our youth. I would like to thank the T3 Foundation, our ministries, and all our stakeholder institutions and organizations for making us experience this moment of pride. I wholeheartedly congratulate all our brothers who participated in the competition, won the prize and opened new horizons with their projects and ideas. Thank God, the number of teams applying is increasing exponentially every year. As you know, we said Bismillah to this event in 2018 with 4 thousand 333 applications. This year, we reached 333 thousand teams and 1 million contestant applications from 81 provinces and 96 countries. The number of competition categories also increased from 14 to 41 main and 102 subcategories.
As the participation increased, the amount of our awards and incentives also increased. The process, which started with a total reward and support figure of 4 million lira, reached 44 million lira. I believe that TEKNOFEST, the festival of records and firsts, will raise the bar of success even higher in the coming period.
On this occasion, I congratulate our T3 Foundation and Baykar company for coming to the rescue of our nation after the February 6 earthquakes. Baykar once again demonstrated that he is the true son of this nation with his exemplary stance against the disaster of the century. Our young brothers, who are volunteers of T3 Foundation and TEKNOFEST, went to the region many times and supported our earthquake victims in their dark days. I congratulate you once again for your sacrifices and efforts, and may God bless you all.
Likewise, I would like to thank my brother İlham for the earthquake houses we have just laid the foundations of together in Kahramanmaraş. Azerbaijani authorities and people have shown what friendship and brotherhood mean in this process.
Dear Young People,
The greatest source of happiness for a politician is to see with his own eyes that his efforts have not been in vain. We have worked really hard to build a technology ecosystem in Turkey. We have fought hard to establish a climate in our country where our young people can follow their dreams without fear. Today, I am happy to see the saplings we planted years ago taking root, flourishing and bearing fruit. I thank God for allowing us to witness the ever-growing enthusiasm of TEKNOFEST youth.
Youth; Today, there are not only the architects of the Turkish century here, but also the Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebis of the future, the Ulugh Begs, Ferganis, Birunis, Ali Kuşçus of the future. Here there are Vecihi Hürkuş, Nuri Demirağ, Nuri Killigil, Şakir Zümre whose dreams were left unfinished. Here are tomorrow's scientists, engineers, intellectuals and entrepreneurs who study, research and whose hearts beat for their country and homeland.
Yes, there is also my dear in-laws, the late Özdemir Bayraktar, here. And their heir, my precious aunt Canan. She is a mother and a wife who personally handled all the accounting of this business, and they carried out this business like this. On the other hand, the brothers' embrace of this business was a separate dynamism for them. I pray that God will open your path, horizon and fortune to all of you.
We broke the shackles of backwardness in Turkey. We established the infrastructure of the great and powerful Turkey. We gave our young people the self-confidence of ""I can do it too."" We have shown that dependence on foreign sources, montageism, and living constantly dependent on others are not the destiny of our nation. Together with its own citizens, we laid the foundations of a Turkey that is the hope of all the oppressed and victimized. With our investments, we have made our country the shining star of its region. Hopefully, you will build the Turkish century.
Youth,
Remember, we are now guests of your time. You will carry this country to the league of giants of the world. You will make our dream of complete independence a reality. I hope you will plant that sacred flag on the bastion, which has been passed from hand to hand and from generation to generation for a thousand years.
As the youth of this country, you will shoulder our cause and hand over the flag to your children. I hope you will revive the values ​​that our martyrs died for. You, along with Gazi Mustafa Kemal, will make happy the souls of Fatih, Yavuz, Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan Abdülhamid, and the henna-laced lambs that fell to the ground in Çanakkale.
You will walk on the path opened by our War of Independence heroes, who made the world difficult for the dirty hands that reached for our sister's veil.
I see this youth in front of me right now. I see the good news of victory in our 40-year struggle in this square. Here I see the space travelers, inventors, pilots, engineers and physicists of tomorrow. I see new scientists who will follow in Aziz Sancar's footsteps and bring new Nobel Prizes to Turkey. Today, I see here a brilliant youth to whose hands we will hand over our country with peace of mind. I am happy to see the good news that a difficult process that involved our sacrifices and efforts has been successful.
Dear Young People,
One by one, we are implementing high-tech projects in our country, behind each of which lies the sweat, labor and determination of our engineers and technicians. You have only seen the developments we have experienced in recent months. My dear brother also expressed it just now. Kızılelma took off, TOGG was put on sale. Here is Kızılelma, standing right in front of us, Akıncı is here. Our ship TCG Anadolu has been delivered to the Naval Forces and hopefully TCG Anadolu will spend the last week in Izmir; It makes a lot of sense, you know what I mean.
Nearly 100 thousand citizens have visited TCG Anadolu so far, perhaps more than that. Black Sea natural gas has been put into service, there are people who cannot even digest this. You understand who cannot digest it. Work a little and you can have it too.
The National Combat Aircraft took to the runway. Our İMECE Satellite was sent into space. Our Gökbey Helicopter rose with our national engine. Altay Tank was delivered to our army for tests. Hürjet and Atak-2 flew. TEKNOFEST is the symbol of all this. The synergy created by this event in our country is starting to seriously disturb some people. The booming TEKNOFEST youth has already become a nightmare for some circles in our country.
With the scandalous statements they have made recently, they reveal the grudge and hatred they have been growing in their stomachs. One of them comes out and talks about touching Turkey's defense projects if they come to power, the other one comes out and claims that UAVs and SIHAs are made from models. Another one comes out; TCG says Anatolia has a lifespan of two bombs. Another one comes out; He talks about giving away the symbol of Turkey's most popular projects to American companies.
My brothers; Whatever they do is in vain. Neither their fancy sentences nor their hypocritical grins are enough to hide their discomfort with Turkey's defense industry moves and our country's companies breaking export records. The other day, as you know, the coalition table has increased considerably; First they said six, then it became seven, then it became nine, now there is a coalition table with nine. No matter what you do, nothing will come of it. We have seen these coalitions many times in the past. There were governments in this country for three months, there were governments for six months, there were governments for nine months, 1 year. What specifically does the presidential system provide to this country? This gain saved the country from these coalitions. Once we hit the road, we went with a bang and came to this day.
The candidate of the nine-party coalition said a lot of absurd things in the video he released at midnight. He began to reveal one by one the instructions given to him in America, where he went to eat hamburgers with FETO members. He has committed to give our airport, which hosts TEKNOFEST, where national technology projects are exhibited, to an American company. While there are local and national companies serving our country, our nation and our army, American companies acting as advertising agencies is called mandate. Dear Mr. Kemal, the people you met with met me and said that they had a desire to make such an investment in Turkey. I said come on, our door is open to everyone as long as they are investors, there is no obstacle. We haven't seen him again since that day. Investing in Turkey requires courage. And it also requires seeing that there is a reliable government in Turkey.
Those who try to undermine the goal of a fully independent Turkey in the defense industry are no different from the British and American Achievers' societies that opposed our War of Independence a century ago. Under the leadership of Kılıçdaroğlu and his supporters, Gazi's party was transformed into the American Supporters' Association. He mentions that space studies will be carried out here. If by this he means a satellite launch center, then such facilities would be established far away from settlements, on sea shores and in deserts, Mr. Kemal. The reason for this is; God forbid, in case of any mishap, no one will be harmed. Even thinking of such a place in the heart of a metropolis where 16 million people live is a disaster in itself. He didn't study well, as usual. If he means that technology development studies will be carried out here, thank God, we have established hundreds of places for this in Istanbul and all over our country. Startups and companies that achieve worldwide success emerge from each of our technoparks. Thank God, our research and development centers, the number of which we have increased to 1249, and our 316 design centers are working hard. Apparently, someone manipulated and deceived Mr. Kemal during his trip to America. They made this an absurd project by saying space, shuttle, Mars. Anyway, at least they didn't try to sell the Bosphorus Bridge to him. Even wasting so much breath is a waste for someone who has no merit other than reading what is put in front of him and repeating what is whispered into his ear.
I wish God's patience to our citizens who are considering voting for CHP, especially CHP, in honor of the memory of Gazi Mustafa Kemal. I pray that God may give patience to our people who have devoted their hearts to other parties to which this person was imposed upon as a presidential candidate. I wish the greatest patience to you, our young people, as they will be constantly exposed to it through various channels during an election period.
Hopefully young people; Are you ready to put an end to all these scenes of shame on May 14?
Are we ready to devote all our time and energy to the rapid construction of Turkey's century after the elections? We will accelerate the projects we have dreamed of and have been preparing for years for the new century of our Republic. We will now put the final touches on Turkey, which we will hand over to our youth, and complete its shortcomings. Our aim; Continue on your way, saying that it turns out there is a nice sound in this dome that remains. We will entrust the great and powerful Turkish heritage to you.
Dear Young People,
I would like to repeat here in your presence a point that I always say; We have only pursued a work and service policy in this country for 21 years. The biggest proof of this is the investments we have made and the services we have heralded in just the last few months. As we explain the good news, some people get upset, angry, and almost become disillusioned. Now, do you know what he says to my brothers in Giresun; He says he will increase the price of hazelnuts by 4 dollars. Did you believe it? Your life is a lie, what did you promise and fulfill? What would they do about water prices in Istanbul? They were going to take it down. What happened? What were they going to do, reduce the bus prices, what did they do? Ankara is like that, Izmir is like that, their lives are lies.
Now there are those who go further and say that your good news is not over. As long as the TEKNOFEST generation is on our side, good news will never end in this country, God willing. We will continue our way with new good news and new successes. As you know, two years ago, I publicly announced the national space program that will take our country to the top leagues in the global space race. Today, we are taking another important step towards making these dreams come true.
In the process we started in May, we identified two space passengers, one primary and one reserve. First of all, I would like to thank the thousands of citizens who applied to become space passengers. I also congratulate our friends who won the right to become space travelers among thousands of applicants.
Our friend, who will go on Turkey's first manned space mission, will stay at the International Space Station for 14 days. In this mission, our space traveler will perform 13 different experiments prepared by our country's valuable universities and research institutions. Our reserve candidate will reinforce his training by performing a suborbital flight. Our space traveler's meeting with space is planned to be in the last quarter of 2023.
Yes, the time has come. It is time to get to know our space passengers who will proudly carry our flag, which will be the symbol of Turkey's power and determination, in space.
First, let's watch the promotional film together.
Yes, our brother Alper Gezeravcı, who will go to the International Space Station, is a heroic Turkish pilot who has achieved significant success in our Air Force Command.
Our brother Tuna Cihangir Atasever, who was selected as a reserve, is a systems engineer working in the field of space launch systems at ROKETSAN. I have no doubt that both of our brothers will fulfill their duties in the best possible way. I pray to God for their success.
As I conclude my words, I would like to congratulate again our young people who won the TEKNOFEST competitions. I would like to express my gratitude again to those who contributed to the establishment of TEKNOFEST, its development and execution.
I greet you all with love and respect, stay healthy.
",2023-05-14,600 new members of the 28th term of the Turkish Grand National Assembly were determined. The presidential election went to the second round because none of the three candidates could secure a majority.,before
Their Speech at Hatay Disaster Coordination Center,2023-02-20,"

I greet you with love and respect.
Two weeks have passed since the February 6 earthquakes, described as the disaster of the century. This disaster, which caused destruction and great loss of life in 11 provinces of our country, once again reminded us all of the fact that Turkey is in a difficult geography with its earthquakes, fires, floods and all other threats. Because we love our country with a deep love, we accept its difficulties as well as its beauties.
We are proud to be the owner of the trust of this geography, which has been the most important battlefield of civilizations, cultures, states and societies since the ancient times of humanity, for the last thousand years. With this love, we have always defended our homeland, sometimes against invaders coming from outside, sometimes against subversives emerging from within, and sometimes against natural disasters that exceed human will. We have always resisted the Crusades, the Mongol raids, the many political and social turmoil we have experienced over the centuries, and the attacks coming from all around us in the last two centuries, with faith, courage and patience.
As a nation, we have not spared any sacrifice, including our lives, to protect the rights, law, honor and future of all our brothers and sisters in our geography. There is no need to go far, this year we have again demonstrated to the whole world our will to protect our homeland forever with our national struggle that we crowned by establishing our Republic, which we are preparing to leave its first century behind. Our struggle for democracy and development continued uninterrupted throughout the history of our Republic. Yes, no matter what we have experienced in this homeland for a thousand years, we have never surrendered, never given up, never despaired. We engraved the earthquakes we experienced two weeks ago today in our hearts and national memory as a painful page of this long and arduous walk.
Right now, there are many brothers and sisters among us who have lost their spouses, children, and relatives. I offer my condolences to all of them, my condolences, may God increase your patience, and let's recite Fatiha for the souls of our dead.
The 7.7 and 7.6 magnitude earthquakes, which we experienced nine hours apart, centered in Pazarcık and Elbistan districts of Kahramanmaraş, are described as unprecedented events in the world with their impact area and destructive power. It was determined that five separate fault lines that broke during the earthquake caused displacements exceeding seven meters in the soil we live on in an area of ​​hundreds of kilometers.
We know that when the difficulties caused by the harsh winter conditions were added to the destruction caused by the earthquake, there were some shortcomings and disruptions despite all our efforts in the first days after the earthquake. The fact that the public and non-governmental disaster capacity in the earthquake area was largely disabled at the first moment further increased the difficulties. From the moment we received the news of the earthquake, we mobilized all our ministries, institutions, municipalities and non-governmental organizations. We mobilized all the resources of the state and the nation to reach the region, initiate search and rescue efforts, and organize aid. We directed all public officials and all non-governmental organizations from Turkey's 81 provinces to the earthquake zone, apart from those directly responsible for this task, who can perform search and rescue, debris removal, aid and support security efforts. Our nation has already voluntarily participated in this mobilization with all its members, from 7 to 70. We called for international help and invited search-rescue and aid teams from other countries to our country.
We have created the legal infrastructure required to carry out the process through declarations of state of emergency, disaster area and force majeure. First of all, we worked day and night to rescue our citizens trapped under the buildings destroyed by the stream, and to reconnect our people who survived the disaster to life. Our teams carried out their heroic work despite the ongoing dangers caused by more than 6 thousand aftershocks, one of which was greater than 6 magnitudes, 37 of which were greater than 5 magnitudes, and 351 of which were greater than 4 magnitudes.
The debris of more than 71 thousand independent units in nearly 21 thousand completely destroyed buildings was removed. 412 thousand independent units in 118 thousand buildings that were demolished, urgently demolished and heavily damaged were evacuated. In addition, more than 133 thousand of our citizens in independent units in more than 24 thousand buildings with moderate damage were transferred to temporary shelter centers or safe places. On the other hand, it was determined that 3 million 108 thousand independent sections in 809 thousand buildings in the earthquake zone were slightly damaged or undamaged. Our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization is about to complete the damage assessment studies it carried out with its 7 thousand 328 personnel. Our citizens can access reports about the damage to their homes through the electronic government system. 271 thousand support, aid and security personnel, including more than 35 thousand search and rescue personnel, took part in the work carried out since the moment of the earthquake. More than 12 thousand heavy construction equipment from various parts of our country participated in debris removal and infrastructure activities in the region.
77 aircraft, 120 helicopters, 38 ships and 45 unmanned aerial vehicles belonging to our public institutions, especially our Ministry of National Defense, police and gendarmerie organizations, participated in the rescue, aid and evacuation efforts. Under-wreck and behind-the-wall imaging systems of our Presidency of Defense Industries were also actively used in search and rescue activities.
Hundreds of non-governmental organizations, municipalities, and volunteer teams from all over our country, especially the Red Crescent, support our earthquake victims with food and clothing aid through mobile kitchens.
Hot meals are served to approximately 2 million 400 thousand citizens a day. The number of blankets distributed in the region reached 3 million, the number of bear tents set up reached 188 thousand, and the number of containers put into service reached 10 thousand. Blanket, tent and container shipments continue, especially to the heavily damaged cities of the earthquake region. We will be able to increase the number of containers, of which 65 thousand more are currently being installed, to 100 thousand in the first stage, and to 200 thousand if necessary.
Currently, the number of earthquake victims sheltered in tents has reached 751 thousand, the number of those sheltered in containers has reached 24 thousand, the number of those sheltered in our dormitories has reached 252 thousand, the number of those sheltered in schools and facilities affiliated with the Ministry of National Education has reached 462 thousand, and the number of those sheltered in hotels or guesthouses belonging to the public and private sectors has reached 195 thousand. Thus, the housing needs of a total of 1 million 684 thousand citizens were met.
Based on their requests, 62 thousand of our citizens were evacuated from the earthquake zone to other cities by road, 289 thousand by air, 21 thousand by railway, and 1156 by sea. Additionally, we have many citizens who go out of the region and to safe places in the region by their own means.
Thank God, our nation has once again shown its magnanimity by opening its arms to its brothers and sisters who came to their city from the earthquake zone and sharing all their opportunities with them.
Undoubtedly, even though their number is very small, there may be poor people who seek to turn the earthquake into an opportunity and exploit the earthquake victims. Although the necessary legal actions are taken regarding the complaints that reach the public or our institutions, our nation imposes the real punishment by convicting them in its conscience.
On the other hand, on this day when we are about to reach the end of the search and rescue efforts, 41 thousand 156 citizens who died in the earthquake were buried. The number of people rescued from the rubble reached 114 thousand 834. This number will be finalized soon after the debris currently being removed is finished and the records are checked.
On this occasion, I once again wish God's mercy to each of our citizens and brothers who lost their lives in the earthquake, patience to their relatives, and a speedy recovery to our loved ones. I pray that God protects our country from all kinds of disasters, troubles and accidents.
I would like to express my gratitude to the public officials, mayors and staff, non-governmental organizations, volunteers, and everyone who has been with the people here with their prayers since the first moment of the earthquake until today, from search and rescue to aid.
My Dear Nation,
Dear friends,
Our citizens living in earthquake zones should be sure of this: We will restore all of our cities with their residences, workplaces, industry, agriculture, historical and cultural values, without allowing the slightest regression or the slightest neglect. We will never leave any of our citizens alone, neither in their pain, nor in their efforts to put their lives back in order, nor in their efforts to build their future.
As a state and a nation, we will protect this region, which contains not only our own but also the common heritage of humanity. We are taking steps to normalize life in solid and slightly damaged buildings. We will begin to move our citizens living in tent cities and container cities to solid, safe and peaceful homes that we will build within a year.
Our TOKİ, which survived the earthquake without any damage to a single building, continues its preparations rapidly. In March, 40 thousand 426 houses were destroyed in Hatay, 45 thousand 67 houses in Kahramanmaraş, 25 thousand 882 houses in Adıyaman, 18 thousand 544 houses in Gaziantep, 44 thousand 770 houses in Malatya, 9 thousand 550 houses in Osmaniye. We are starting the construction of 6 thousand houses in Diyarbakır, 3 thousand houses in Şanlıurfa, 3 thousand 750 houses in Elazığ, 2 thousand 500 houses in Adana and 250 houses in Kilis. As the damage assessment, debris removal and location determination processes are completed, the number of these housing units will increase in each province. We design all residences within the framework of a new city plan, in accordance with its own architecture, natural, historical and cultural texture, by looking at the ground quality and distance to the fault line. None of our residences will exceed the ground floor plus 3 or 4 floors. We will carry out the renovation works in our villages, with their houses, barns, gardens and parks, according to their unique architecture, just like we did in Manavgat. We carry out the revival process according to the principles of scientificity, speed and the strength of our structures. I will underline one more thing here; We will never carry out construction and renovation works in this region with the logic of strengthening, all of them are ground from scratch plus 3, you didn't know, 4, we will do our construction in this way.
We work in intensive consultation with our geophysics, geotechnics, geology, seismology teachers and earthquake experts from all universities in our country, and we act according to the results.
Cost-benefit analyzes and planning for the quality and rapid supply of all building materials required for our construction, from iron to steel, from cement to ceramics, are ongoing.
We saw once again in these earthquakes that structures built with the right techniques on solid ground did not collapse. For this purpose, we activated all the leading architecture, engineering offices, project offices and city plans of our country. We want to keep our settlements away from disasters caused by ground liquefaction by shifting them from the plains to the mountains as much as possible.
We are making plans to protect our ancient settlements in a way that is in line with their historical and cultural texture and at the same time strongly.
While planning the revitalization of our cities, we also take the opinions of our citizens, business people and local administrators in our disaster-damaged provinces, along with our scientists and experts. We take every step in accordance with common sense. We carry out the ground surveys that we care most about with the technique described as microzonation. According to these studies, zoning restrictions, floor height and density reductions are entirely aimed at ensuring the safety of life and property of our citizens.
We also postponed TOKİ installment payments in 11 provinces affected by the earthquake for three months.
While we continue our revival activities rapidly, we also prioritize education. We evaluate the situation of each of our primary and secondary schools separately. We will ensure that education starts on March 1 in Adana, Kilis, Diyarbakır and Şanlıurfa. We determined this date as 13 March for Gaziantep and Osmaniye, and 27 March for Hatay, Adıyaman, Malatya and Kahramanmaraş.
We will not require attendance for our students in earthquake zone provinces. We provide all kinds of facilities to our students who want to transfer to other provinces. Our secondary school and high school students who will continue their education in other provinces will be able to directly transfer to hostel schools. In addition, we will ensure that our children in tent cities and other accommodation centers continue their education through transportation or similar methods.
We do not cause any disruption in the health services provided both in our undamaged hospitals and other facilities and in the temporary health centers established. We carefully monitor the treatment of our injured people who have been transferred to other provinces.
We closely follow the diligent work of our healthcare professionals in the earthquake region and the places where our earthquake victims were taken. I would like to thank all our healthcare professionals, from doctors to nurses, from UMKE team to pharmacists, who supported our nation during these disaster days.
Apart from some exceptional incidents, there were no serious problems regarding security services. We stand by our earthquake victims whenever they need, 24 hours a day, with our reinforced police, gendarmerie, and with the help of our military when necessary.
We are rapidly protecting our 244 cultural assets, which were damaged to varying degrees in the disaster of the century. We immediately started the necessary work for the renovation and repair of our cultural assets such as tombs, mosques, churches, synagogues and registered buildings.
Our Ministry of Culture and Tourism has taken action to preserve cultural structures that are not under public ownership, even if they are destroyed, in a manner befitting their historical importance. Our aim; Our aim is to bring back our cultural assets, just like residences and workplaces, to our country within one year.
My Dear Nation,
Dear friends,
As soon as we received the news of the earthquake, we allocated a budget of 100 billion lira from the Treasury for the work to be carried out in the region. Our institutions' earthquake-related funding requests are fulfilled immediately. We provide 10 thousand lira aid to each household damaged in the earthquake. We provide moving aid of 15 thousand liras and rent aid of between 2 thousand and 5 thousand liras to those living in demolished, to be demolished, heavily and moderately damaged buildings. We provide cash support of 100 thousand liras each to the relatives of our deceased citizens so that they can meet their urgent needs.
We ensure that payments regarding notices received within the scope of natural disaster insurance are made quickly. We facilitate premium payments for traffic insurance policies in emergency areas and ensure that no additional premiums are requested for policies that cannot be renewed on time due to an earthquake.
By considering the earthquake as a force majeure event for public tenders, we prevent wasting time with additional applications in this regard. Necessary warnings have been made to banks to keep the banking system in the region operational.
We doubled the credit card installment periods for our citizens in the earthquake zone. Maturity limits will not be taken into account in postponed consumer and vehicle loans. In addition to their contribution to the 50 billion lira solidarity package we previously announced, our banks provide additional support for the earthquake zone. Our Central Bank contributed to the Turkey One Heart Campaign with 30 billion liras, our Ziraat Bank with 20 billion liras, our Foundations Bank with 12 billion liras, our Halk Bank with 7 billion liras, and our Ziraat, Vakıf and Emlak Katılım companies with 1 billion liras each, for a total of 72 billion liras. The loan debts of all our citizens living in heavily damaged provinces and districts are automatically postponed for 6 months, and in other places in the region, they are postponed for 1 month, depending on demand. All of our citizens who were damaged in the earthquake can benefit from a 6-month postponement upon request. Our public banks write off the loan debts of our citizens who died in the earthquake.
We postponed the Treasury-backed loan payments from Halk Bank for 150 thousand tradesmen whose workplaces and businesses were damaged for 6 months. We have also prepared a 20 billion lira earthquake zone business and investment support package for such businesses. We gave our farmers who were damaged in the earthquake the opportunity to postpone their Treasury-backed loans from Ziraat Bank and Tarım Kredi for 1 year. We postponed the payments of the loans of 152 municipalities in the region where heavy destruction occurred to Iller Bank for 3 months. In addition, in order to prevent the negative impact of the earthquake on economic activities across the country, we increased the KGF package of 250 billion lira, which we previously announced, to 350 billion lira with an addition of 100 billion lira.
Our public banks started to provide special loans with favorable conditions to the disaster area to heal the earthquake wounds. Thus, the in-kind and cash support provided by our banks to the earthquake region reached 80 billion lira.
We are depositing the diesel and fertilizer supports paid in kind to our farmers in the region, totaling 2.8 billion lira, in cash to their accounts in February. We will make livestock support payments of 530 million lira throughout the year to our farmers in the earthquake zone provinces by the end of February. In addition, we will provide 1.5 billion lira of feed support to our producers in these provinces for 2 million cattle and 9 million sheep.
We will replace the losses of our farmers, whose animals perished in the earthquake, as cows if they are cows, sheep if they are sheep, chickens if they are chickens, and bees if they are bees, free of charge. We will compensate the losses of our breeders and breeders in the same way.
We will immediately meet the urgent sugar needs of nearly 1.5 million tons of 12 thousand beekeepers in these provinces.
On the other hand, we ensure rapid employment of 20 thousand citizens in the provinces of the region within the scope of our Turkish Employment Agency's social benefit work project. We are doing and will do whatever is necessary to make our tradesmen, artisans, small and medium-sized business owners, industrialists and farmers, whom we see as the backbone of our country, the dynamo of our cities as soon as possible.
Within the scope of the declaration of force majeure, we postponed the obligations of our taxpayers in these provinces to the finance until July 31. In this regard, we postponed the declaration and notification periods of taxpayers in the region until August 15, and the payment periods of accrued taxes until August 31. Motor vehicle taxpayers will also benefit from these postponements.
We are postponing the March, May and July installments of taxpayers within the scope of the Restructuring Law to August, October and December.
We do not impose taxes or add VAT to aid provided to earthquake victims. We ensure that in-kind and cash aid provided against receipt can be deducted from the tax base.
We are reducing the VAT rate on prefabricated buildings and containers to be built in the region to 1 percent by the end of the year.
We are using all public inspection tools, especially tax and social security inspections, in the harshest way, for those who have unfairly increased prices, especially for urgently needed products.
There are some products in particular, and there are people who abuse their export. It is a state of emergency, I especially warn about these, seriously, where they are caught by our relevant units, the necessary interrogation and accounting will be done once.
We also removed the default status for investors in the earthquake zone so that they do not suffer from share purchase transactions.
We have taken effective intervention into extraordinary negative developments in companies' share values ​​beyond the restrictive provisions in the Capital Markets Board legislation.
As you can see, we stand by and support each of our people who were harmed by the earthquake, without leaving any segment out, and we mobilize our resources to help them hold on to life again.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Hatay is the city that suffered the heaviest destruction and loss of life in the earthquake. The bodies of 17 thousand 436 citizens were taken out from under 6 thousand 251 buildings that turned into rubble in our city and buried, and the number of injured people exceeded 30 thousand.
Of the few buildings whose debris removal process is still ongoing, almost all of them are in Hatay. In addition to the demolished ones, the number of buildings to be urgently demolished and heavily damaged is over 34 thousand, and the number of independent sections there is over 134 thousand. In other words; Nearly one-third of the buildings in Hatay have become uninhabitable.
The number of search-rescue and support personnel we have assigned in Hatay to date is nearly 75 thousand, and the number of construction equipment is close to five thousand. 180 thousand citizens continue their lives in 40 thousand tents set up for earthquake survivors. We contributed to overcoming the heating problem with the 20 thousand sacks of coal and 21 thousand sacks of wood we distributed.
Since the containers coming from Qatar will be unloaded at Iskenderun Port, we plan to install a significant part of them in the Hatay region.
As the debris is removed, problems with electricity, natural gas and water are solved.
On the issue that our mukhtar just expressed, we will hopefully solve those problems by giving our mukhtars our support at the container point.
After the damaged runway and connection roads of Hatay Airport were repaired, we opened Hatay Airport to humanitarian aid planes and returning passenger flights within a week. But the head of the Main Opposition continues to tell such lies that their municipality has reconstructed and repaired Hatay Airport. Know your place, this is not your job, you won't understand these things. I have always kept silent until today, but the position I was in forced me to keep silent. Be honest, let's see that one day you are honest, but unfortunately such honesty does not exist. The day I personally came to Hatay, I sent my Deputy Chairman there and told him to go there and see, because Mr. Binali was the Minister during the construction period and he knows what is going on. There is no such thing as a municipality coming and developing the place, but they are full of lies. As a matter of fact, I will name it now, IGA, that is, Kalyon İnşaat, one of the partners of Istanbul Airport, took over the place in 5 days and quickly completed and built it and delivered it to our nation; This is the truth of the matter. But unfortunately there is no truth or honesty in these.
If you are looking at the problems in communication, these are all over the place. Now, our communication problems have been solved by mobile stations being dispatched to the region and making the existing infrastructure operational.
We have immediately started and are continuing to work to revive the entire city, especially the districts of Antakya, Kırıkhan, İskenderun, Samandağ, Arsuz, Reyhanlı and Defne, where the greatest destruction occurred in the earthquake.
We were talking about this in the car with Mr. Devlet today, we will build these places from scratch once. In other words, let's strengthen it, let's do it this way, let's not do it that way, we will hopefully build a new Antakya from scratch, we will rebuild Arsuz, we will rebuild Iskenderun, etc. By rebuilding all destroyed and ruined places from scratch, we will ensure that all our citizens can settle here in peace of mind, but we will be allowed at least one year. And as of now, our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization has started its work, all plan and project studies are continuing rapidly, ground surveys are continuing rapidly, hopefully we will take steps with all these.
To support our citizens engaged in animal husbandry in the region, we distributed 2,300 tons of feed and 150 animal tents to our farmers.
Hatay, where Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atatürk prepared the infrastructure for joining our country after a short separation by saying ""it is my personal matter"", is a city that keeps alive the accumulation of different civilizations in our geography. Many values, from the first known church of Christianity to thousands of years old synagogues and the Habib-i Neccar Mosque, the first Islamic temple in Anatolia, have managed to live side by side in these lands until today. We will revive Hatay with all its colors within the framework of our emergency action plan that we started by saying ""for Hatay right now"". We will rebuild our destroyed civilization values, especially our Hatay Parliament Building, in accordance with the original, and we will restore the damaged ones.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We have identified all the deficiencies and disruptions related to the earthquake, down to the smallest detail, except for those with disabilities that are beyond human will, and hopefully we will do whatever we can to prevent it from recurring in the future. In this context, we are reviewing and strengthening the disaster plans we have prepared for all 81 provinces, with priority given to those with high earthquake risk, in the light of recent experiences.
Of course, there is also this: We are accelerating our work by interpreting the statement - Ibn Khaldun - that geography is destiny, as making preparations to cope with the difficulties more effectively by using the advantages of our geography.
In addition to natural disasters, we consider all kinds of threats to our existence as a state and nation as risks. We plan to transform our current disaster and crisis management system into a structure that will prevent all material and moral grievances of our people against all kinds of natural, political, economic and social risks and threats.
Hopefully, after leaving the urgent issues related to the earthquake behind, we will consider this issue as our priority agenda and take the necessary steps. In this context, we have already started to operate some mechanisms. We put into effect, through our governorship, the earthquake emergency action plan in Istanbul, which was completed during the late Kadir Topbaş's term, but was not implemented later. In the first stage, it was decided that 109 of our 128 schools, which were determined to be at risk, would be demolished and rebuilt, and 109 would be strengthened. 93 of these schools, including their students, were immediately evacuated by being transferred to different places. We are determined to quickly eliminate the issues that waste time and even create obstacles in our efforts to transform our stock, which has a low structure against earthquakes and other disasters, more quickly.
Of course, I have a request here, and it is this: Please do not let my citizens hinder our urban transformation plans. If we are taking steps at the point of urban transformation, let our citizens help us in this regard and let's start these constructions quickly. In addition to accelerating legal processes, we will share with our nation everyone who prevents or delays urban transformation plans due to political or commercial concerns.
The disaster caused today by those who prevented the urban transformation works in Iskenderun with campaigns and lawsuits is and should be a lesson to everyone. We know that similar situations are experienced in other cities, especially Istanbul. We expect the obstruction efforts, carried out by some ideological obsessions and some by simple self-interest, to come to an end.
We believe that all institutions of our state and 85 million people of our nation will take their place in the work that will increase our country's capacity to combat crisis and disaster as one heart.
Finally, I would like to complete my words by sharing with you the measures regarding the recycling of debris excavations and debris in the earthquake zone.
We will transport the waste to areas with suitable topography and geology that will not harm the environment and humans, and subject them to separation and classification processes there. After all the usable elements are separated, we will use the remaining concrete and brick waste as filling material in appropriate works in the new places we will build. Thus, we will eliminate debris with a system that both evaluates waste and protects the environment.
Hopefully, by working shoulder to shoulder with the state and the nation, we will leave these troubled days behind in a short time. We will overcome the disaster of the century together, as 85 million people, by displaying the solidarity of the century. I pray that God will help our country and nation.
With these feelings, I once again greet you all with love and respect, stay in good health.
I would like to underline one issue in particular; Please do not believe the rumors about changing the demographic structure of Hatay. No one has the power to change the demographic structure of Hatay. It is useful for you to know this.

Their Speech After the Cabinet Meeting,2023-02-14,"

My Dear Nation,
Dear Press Members,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Our country was shaken by two major earthquakes on February 6, in an area of ​​unprecedented magnitude and magnitude unprecedented in its history.
We experienced the two biggest disasters in the history of the Republic after the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, one after the other, on the same day. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake centered in Kahramanmaraş's Pazarcık district occurred on February 6 at 04:17, and the 7.6 magnitude earthquake centered in Kahramanmaraş's Elbistan district occurred at 13:24 on the same day.
While these earthquakes, the number of aftershocks of which reached 3,170, caused heavy destruction in the provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Adıyaman, Gaziantep, Malatya, Osmaniye, Kilis, Adana, Şanlıurfa and Diyarbakır, where approximately 13.5 million citizens live, they also caused small-scale destruction in some nearby provinces. caused damage. Depending on the length of the ruptured fault, the earthquake's destruction spread over an area of ​​approximately 500 kilometers, and its felt effect spread over an area of ​​more than a thousand kilometers. The disaster, which occurred in an area larger than the territorial integrity of many countries in the world, occurred seven kilometers closer to the surface than other major earthquakes in history, increasing the destruction with its multiplier effect. These successive earthquakes released an energy equivalent to hundreds of the most powerful atomic bombs. While most of the major earthquakes in the world occur in the oceans and affect the land, the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes occurred directly under our settlements. As a matter of fact, by the consensus of all experts in the world, the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes are considered an exceptional natural event due to their size, destructiveness and successive occurrences. Such a large earthquake, which caused a three-meter slide southwards in our country, brought serious losses of life.
May God have mercy on each of the 35 thousand 418 citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake, and I offer my condolences to their relatives and our nation. I pray to God for a speedy recovery for our 105 thousand 505 injured people who escaped from the rubble or were rescued by search and rescue teams. 13 thousand 208 of our injured are still under treatment in our hospitals.
Unfortunately, the consecutive occurrence of two disasters of a magnitude that is rare even in the history of world earthquakes has made the situation before us even worse. Some of the buildings damaged in the first earthquake completely collapsed in the second earthquake. Of the more than 19 thousand buildings that turned into rubble, the intervention of 15 thousand was completed. So far, 1 million 850 thousand houses and workplaces in approximately 369 thousand buildings in the earthquake zone have been examined by the teams of the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization Climate Change. According to initial determinations, it was determined that 211 thousand residences in 47 thousand buildings in the earthquake zone were collapsed, were to be demolished urgently and were seriously damaged. The exact numbers will be revealed when the damage assessment studies are completed within 1 week.
In addition to the magnitude of the damage in the earthquake area, the harsh winter conditions and the destruction in the infrastructure, especially transportation and energy, made our job very difficult. All these problems initially caused serious disruptions in both search-rescue and aid efforts. Despite this, we immediately mobilized the remaining capacities of our cities in the region and the public facilities throughout our country, starting from nearby cities. Despite the width of the disaster area, the magnitude of the destruction and the obstacles caused by the winter season, we pushed the conditions to the end. We mobilized as a state and nation to reach our earthquake-hit cities as quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition to transportation and energy, the damaged drinking water and sewage infrastructures of our cities brought additional problems for earthquake victims and aid teams.
Of course, we also experienced the disruptions that can be seen in any country in the world where such a great disaster occurs. But our nation should have no doubt about this: Our state, with its ministries, institutions, municipalities, civil society, international aid organizations, in short, has struggled with all its resources to reach the earthquake zone as soon as possible and start working. Our nation, with all its members, took action spontaneously to come to the aid of the earthquake victims or to collect and send aid to them.
As the hours passed, our teams from other places also joined the work that our public officials and citizens who survived the earthquake started immediately. As the difficulties of the first hours and days were overcome, the work carried out began to become more systematic and effective. With close coordination between AFAD Center and our provinces, the settlements affected by the earthquake were reached. Work throughout the region has been streamlined with all processes, from search and rescue to distribution of relief materials, from debris removal to health and security services. Approximately 250 thousand public servants, including those from other 71 provinces of Turkey, are involved in the work in the earthquake zone. In addition to public personnel, the number of professional staff directly participating in search and rescue efforts, together with non-governmental organizations and international aid teams, exceeded 35 thousand. The number of work machines assigned to the field reached 12 thousand 235, the number of aircraft reached 76, the number of helicopters reached 121, the number of ships reached 26, and the number of unmanned aerial vehicles reached 45.
The fact that our search and rescue teams were able to rescue our citizens alive from under the rubble, even after long hours after the earthquake, is our most important source of consolation in this dark situation.
320 mobile kitchens belonging to various institutions distribute hot meals in the region every day. The number of hot meals distributed by our Red Crescent alone amounted to 20 million, bread to 22 million, and water to 15.5 million.
We received responses from 100 countries to the international call for help we made immediately after the earthquake. 84 of them actually participated in the work in the field, with a total of 10 thousand 943 search and rescue personnel. The teams of four countries completed their work and returned. All five countries informed our representatives that they would send teams. I would like to underline that this figure corresponds to a very significant part of the world's total search and rescue capacity.
In addition, I had telephone conversations with the heads of state and government of 42 countries from all over the world, who called us to support and offer their condolences to our country. My dear brother Sheikh Tamim, the Emir of Qatar, and ministerial representatives from various countries came to our country and personally expressed their condolences.
Additionally, humanitarian aid was delivered to our country with 444 flights from 61 different countries. Our friends and brothers all over the world, from Africa to the Turkish Republics, from the Gulf Region to Europe, from Asia to America, mobilized for our nation. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to express my gratitude to each of our friends who stood by us with their aid teams, financial aid and commitments, moral support and prayers on this dark day in Turkey.
My Dear Nation,
We will continue our work until we get the last citizen trapped under the collapsed buildings in the earthquake zone. When we bury our dead, we will bury their pain in our hearts and place their memories in the most sacred corner of our hearts to preserve them for a lifetime. After completing the search and rescue efforts completely, we will accelerate the debris removal process. We will quickly complete the ongoing work. We will rebuild every house and every workplace that the earthquake destroyed or made uninhabitable and deliver them to their rightful owners.
TOKİ is an institution that emerged victoriously from this earthquake with the quality and safety of the 1 million 180 thousand buildings it built across the country. In addition, the 3.3 million houses that we have urban transformed have made a significant contribution to the earthquake safety of our country, thus we have provided 24 million people with houses where they can live in peace. The fact that 98 percent of all buildings destroyed in the last disaster were built before 1999 shows us the progress we have made in building standards and inspection, but also reminds us that we need to be more strict. In this context, in the light of scientific data, preparations for new houses and cities to be built in the region have been started by our Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change and TOKİ. Knowing that we do not have even a single minute to save, we will immediately start construction work wherever the damage assessment is completed. According to the current situation, we can immediately start the construction of 30 thousand houses as of the beginning of March. Gradually, within a few months, the construction of all the residences we will build away from the fault lines will begin. Our aim; To complete the construction of a number of quality and safe buildings that will meet the housing needs in the entire earthquake zone within one year. During this period, we plan to meet the temporary shelter needs of earthquake victims with tents, containers and prefabricated structures, dormitories, hotel rooms and public guesthouses allocated for this purpose, rental housing in other provinces, in short, with all the opportunities our country has.
I ask my citizens in the earthquake zone to be patient for a year. Hopefully, we will completely compensate for the destruction caused by the earthquake by building houses in suitable areas where they can be revived according to the analyzes to be made, and in suitable areas for those that need to be moved elsewhere.
Just as we erased the traces of destruction and delivered new houses to their owners in the past in the Van, Elazığ, Malatya, İzmir, Bingöl earthquakes, Kastamonu, Bartın, Sinop, Giresun flood disasters, Antalya and Muğla fires, and all other disasters, with God's permission, the same thing will happen here. we will do. In this process, we will not leave any of our citizens abandoned materially or morally, and we will ensure that aid and shelter efforts continue regularly.
My request from my citizens living in the earthquake zone is to protect their cities, districts, neighborhoods, homes, jobs, in short, their lives with all their elements. Together, we will relieve the pain of this disaster, heal its wounds, and compensate its losses, without ever giving in to discouragement, weariness, fatigue, or despair.
Yesterday, I was at Istanbul Çam Sakura Hospital and I had the opportunity to see the earthquake victims there, their children, their mothers and all their families in person. While many of them are coming to their families in Istanbul, the injured are receiving treatment at Çam Sakura Hospital. At Çam Sakura Hospital, treatments are provided without leaving anything out. And at this point, our Ministry of Health is making the necessary interventions by distributing it to different hospitals in Istanbul. And in this context, I have already announced that we will provide 15 thousand lira moving and five thousand lira to two thousand lira rental aid per household that has become uninhabitable in the first stage, as well as 10 thousand lira support aid per household.
We cover the fuel costs of our citizens who take their families to provinces outside the earthquake zone with their own vehicles. In addition, we provide cash aid of 100 thousand lira to the relatives of our citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake for their urgent needs. We will also provide additional support to our citizens according to the needs that will arise in the coming days. As a state and a nation, we will join hands and not leave any victim and oppressed unattended.
We already know the generosity of our nation and the wealth of our business people from past disasters. Our institutions have already taken action. Our banking sector, under the leadership of our Ministry of Treasury and Finance, allocated a certain percentage of their 2022 profits, currently around 50 billion lira, to the earthquake as a solidarity package. This amount will be used for studies for earthquake victims.
Additionally, additional Credit Guarantee Fund guaranteed resources have been prepared for businesses in the region. We will provide every necessary contribution to ensure that the region, which contributes 20 billion dollars to our country's exports, gets back on its feet with employment, production, trade and exports as soon as possible.
Approximately 638 thousand taxpayers will benefit from the force majeure declared in the provinces in our earthquake zone, which includes many elements from tax deferrals to banking regulations.
We use all of the aid provided to AFAD at home and abroad, which currently amounts to 8.3 billion lira, for the earthquake zone.
Tomorrow evening at 20:00, a charity campaign will be organized with the participation of all television channels and radios in Turkey, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Azerbaijan with the slogan ""Turkey is one heart"".
As Cabinet members and public officials who attended the Cabinet Meeting, we decided to donate a total of 136 million 589 thousand liras to AFAD for earthquake victims, with the commitments made by ourselves and our friends from their salaries and the contributions of our business ministers.
My Dear Nation,
We visited 10 provinces where great destruction and loss of life occurred since the 3rd day of the earthquake, saw the work on site, and offered our condolences and wishes to get well soon to our citizens.
Our Vice President coordinates the work with my fellow ministers at the AFAD center day and night. Our ministers have been working diligently in our provinces in the region since the first day.
While we are removing the ruins, we are trying to create the capacity to provide shelter to millions of our citizens in the most humane conditions during this winter apocalypse. We have currently met the shelter needs of a total of 1.6 million earthquake victims, approximately 890 thousand of whom are in public dormitories and facilities and 50 thousand of whom are in hotels. We estimate that approximately 2 million 200 thousand of our citizens left the region through evacuations and their own means.
We have exceeded 175 thousand in the number of tents established, 5 thousand 400 in the number of containers, and 2 million 652 thousand in the number of blankets sent to the region.
We will put 10 thousand containers that started to leave Qatar at the service of those in need with reinforcements from within and outside the country. These 10 thousand containers, which are really beautiful and modern, were built in Qatar during the World Cup. Thanks to the Emir of Qatar, he is sending these 10 thousand containers to our country and as of now, the ships are being loaded from one side and the first ship is on the way. Of course, this journey takes at least 7 hours. With the arrival of these ships gradually, these containers will be distributed to the region from Iskenderun and Mersin Ports.
The flow of clothing, food, cleaning products and other materials to the region continues uninterrupted. The number of materials brought to the region through donations and other methods reached 25 million.
Our Ministry of Culture and Tourism has ensured that a certain portion of the capacities of hotels closed due to the tourism season and all hotels across the country will be allocated to earthquake victims. We also use other accommodation facilities, especially public guesthouses, for this purpose.
We also opened the dormitories affiliated with our Credit and Dormitories Institution, which has the fastest and most effective accommodation potential of our country, to earthquake victims without causing any harm to our students.
Thousands of our university students, academics and administrative staff, all of whom we express our gratitude to, take an active part in the work in the earthquake zone.
Attendance will not be required in the second term in all schools affiliated with our Ministry of National Education in the earthquake zone. Education will start on February 20 in primary and secondary schools in our other 71 provinces. The fact that only 95 of the 20 thousand 868 school buildings in the earthquake zone are ruined and heavily matted provides the opportunity for our students who wish to start education in schools with suitable conditions in 11 provinces, including Elazığ, as of March 1. We have created the capacity to meet the demands of all our families who want to transfer their children to schools in other provinces.
We follow with appreciation the work carried out by our army of educators in every field, from shelter to food, from search and rescue to support and organizations.
Our Ministry of Internal Affairs has shouldered the burden of the earthquake from the first moment with its entire central and civil organization, police, gendarmerie, coast guard and municipalities, especially AFAD. Our Police Department, with its 73 thousand personnel and our gendarmerie with 65 thousand personnel, provides service day and night in every aspect in the region.
Nearly 10 thousand volunteers working under the coordination of AFAD are writing an epic with their efforts.
Our Ministry of National Defense and Turkish Armed Forces have mobilized all their land, sea and air resources to help earthquake victims, remove debris, ensure security and carry out logistics services.
I would like to thank once again the 28 thousand heroic Turkish soldiers currently serving in the region for their efforts and sacrifices.
Our Ministry of Health serves both our injured and earthquake victims with the field hospitals it has established in addition to the existing hospitals, with 3 thousand 759 personnel in 1259 ambulances sent to the region and more than 3 thousand UMKE personnel.
While our Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure is taking action to ensure that the closed roads and Hatay Airport become operational as soon as possible, our Turkish Airlines is also transporting search and rescue teams to the region and earthquake victims to other provinces. Here's what we did with Hatay Airport in 5 days, we put it back into operation.
Our Ministry of Energy quickly mobilized relevant institutions to deliver the electricity and natural gas that were cut off due to collapsed poles and damaged infrastructure to our cities as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, the truly courageous struggle of all the miners who came to the earthquake zone here from the Zonguldak Turkey Coal Enterprises of our Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources will never be erased from our memories. The tunnels they opened and the way they took our earthquake victims out of these tunnels were truly extraordinary situations. Likewise, all other elements of AFAD fought this struggle in this way.
Our Ministry of Family and Social Services fulfills its responsibilities in its field of duty with its 5 thousand 108 personnel, from providing psychosocial support to earthquake victims to caring for orphans, the elderly and the disabled.
Our Ministry of Justice assigned hundreds of prosecutors in the region to carry out the legal procedures required for the burial of the bodies, to follow up on those responsible for the collapsed buildings, and to carry out public order work.
While our Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry controlled the dams in the region through DSI, it directed the personnel and equipment of our General Directorate of Forestry for search-rescue and aid works. This is where politics got ugly. What did they do? They started talking about the fact that the dams had burst and unfortunately the dams could no longer hold water. With the slanders made by social media at this point, especially in this difficult time when we need to be united and act as a unit, unfortunately, yes, politics in Turkey and a certain section of the Main Opposition have become seriously ugly. On the one hand, these steps are being taken on social media with such lies, and on the other hand, yes, you see, they are going to go to the CMB regarding the steps taken at Borsa Istanbul and demonstrate in front of the CMB, and they are talking about the money of this nation being destroyed at the CMB or in different places.
Dear friends,
The day is a time to be one, a time to be together. If you have documents about such things, you have never spoken with such documents in your hand throughout your life, your life is a lie, you have always acted with lies. Here too, the liar's candle burns until nightfall. Just so you know, your candle has already burned and continues to burn. These slanders will never be forgiven by my nation.
I have traveled around the election districts for years, and now I am traveling around the disaster areas, I will travel again, I will go to these regions again and interact with my citizens.
In the meantime, we are rapidly making the support payment of 8.3 billion lira for our 2.2 million farmers and 8.2 million farmers in the region where ÇKS applications have been extended until May 8.
While our Ministry of Commerce increases its inspections to prevent earthquake opportunists, it also supports our tradesmen and craftsmen.
Our Ministry of Labor and Social Security is taking steps to help our employees in earthquake-prone cities, one of the leading production regions of our country, and to facilitate Social Security Institution services.
Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through our diplomatic representatives, is taking measures to meet the demands of our citizens abroad and the teams coming to our country.
From our religious community to our miners, from our non-governmental organizations to our business world, everyone is making a selfless effort to alleviate the burden of our earthquake victims. I would like to thank all our institutions, public officials, non-governmental organizations and volunteers once again for their efforts, sacrifices and struggles.
My Dear Nation,
While we are experiencing one of the rare disasters that nations and states may encounter for centuries, we are going through a period in which we need unity, solidarity, solidarity and conscience the most. We are working with all our strength to erase the traces of this disaster from our country and build a bright future for our people, completely disregarding the mischief, lies and delusions of the corrupters. In an environment where millions of our people are writhing in pain in front of the ruins of the earthquake disaster and others share their pain, I truly feel sad to see those attacking left and right just to gain political gain. For now, we also take note of those who expose the feelings of heartbroken people to all kinds of depravity, from exploitation to racism, slander and disinformation to devalue the self-sacrificing work carried out.
While people are in trouble for their lives, as I just said, we will never forget those who go to the CMB and engage in politics, those who provoke our students, those who try to sabotage the activities carried out with all their heart and soul by provoking people against their state.
Out of respect for our nation and as required by the office I currently represent, we will of course not forgive those who seek to turn the earthquake disaster into political gain, but we will not stoop to their level either. Now is the time to heal the wounds, relieve the pain, repair what was destroyed, and reconnect millions of our people to life. We use our time, energy and opportunities just for this.
We pray that God protects our country and nation from all kinds of disasters, troubles and accidents, and may God help us.
Once again, I greet you all with love and respect, stay in good health.

",2023-02-06,"Severe earthquakes with magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.7, respectively, in Kahramanmaraş province, affected 11 provinces. It was reported that 50 thousand people died and 107 thousand people were injured.",after
Their Speech in the Diyarbakır Earthquake Zone,2023-02-11,"

Dear Diyarbakır residents,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with love and respect. First of all, I wish to get well soon to all the cities affected by the earthquake, including Diyarbakır.
As you know, Diyarbakır was one of the provinces affected by the earthquake disaster with a magnitude of 7.7 and then 7.6 that we experienced on Monday. These earthquakes are 3 times larger and 3 times more destructive than the 1999 earthquake, which was the biggest disaster in our country's recent memory. Again, it is calculated to be a much larger area and a much more destructive disaster than the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. It is not possible to compare the destructiveness of the 1943 Çankırı, 1953 Çanakkale, 1944 Gerede, 1966 Varto, 1967 Mudurnu, 1970 Gediz, 1976 Muradiye earthquakes, which had magnitudes above 7, with the destructiveness of this earthquake. These two consecutive earthquakes, let alone their aftershocks, are at a very high level in our country's earthquake inventory. What we see and hear during our visits to our cities is proof of what a great disaster Turkey is facing. The world's leading scientists agree on the magnitude and destructiveness of the earthquake our country experienced.
Although this earthquake, described as the disaster of the century, was felt in an area of ​​​​almost a thousand kilometers, it actually caused destruction in an area of ​​500 kilometers. Our cities, where earthquakes caused destruction, are home to 13.5 million people. This number is approaching 20 million, including the adjacent cities where tremors are felt and therefore our people experience earthquake anxiety. It would be safe to say that in some parts of our settlements close to fault lines, there is almost no stone left on top. Huge cracks in the land and slides that leave highways and railways bent like thin wires are also signs of the severity of the earthquake.
The second earthquake caused relatively less loss of life because it occurred during the day, but it caused the damage to increase significantly by completely destroying the damaged buildings in the first earthquake. In addition to the collapsed buildings, hundreds of thousands of buildings have become uninhabitable due to their damage.
So far, the total loss of life in the earthquake region has reached 21 thousand 43. Additionally, 80 thousand 97 of our injured people were rescued. In this earthquake, unfortunately, nearly 320 buildings in Diyarbakır, 7 of which were completely destroyed, became unusable, 255 of our brothers died and 901 of our brothers were hospitalized with injuries. May God have mercy on our brothers and sisters who lost their lives in the entire earthquake area, and I wish patience to their families, loved ones and relatives. I pray for a speedy recovery for each of our injured.
Search and rescue activities have been completed in some of our cities, and work continues at full speed in others. We are transferring the teams in the regions where the work has been completed to the provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Hatay and Adıyaman, where the destruction is more severe.
We saw Kahramanmaraş and Hatay on Wednesday and Adıyaman yesterday, identified the problems and gave the necessary instructions. Hopefully, we will complete the work here quickly and not leave any of our citizens dead or alive under the rubble. Then, we will quickly begin debris removal and reconstruction activities. We are making plans to rebuild hundreds of thousands of houses with their infrastructure and superstructure, or more precisely, to rebuild our cities that suffered great destruction in the earthquake. We will start taking concrete steps in a few weeks. Just as we have previously supported our people in the earthquakes in Van, Elazığ, Malatya and İzmir, in the floods in our cities of Kastamonu, Bartın, Sinop and Giresun, in the fires in Antalya and Muğla, in short, in all disasters, hopefully we will heal the wounds here in a short time. I hope to wait a year, we will complete the construction and revival works within a year. Just as we have accomplished these things in earthquakes and floods in the provinces I have just listed, I hope we will achieve these in Diyarbakır and our other nine provinces.
We have mobilized all the resources of our state. We have allocated 100 billion from the Treasury and Finance alone for these works. Trust us, believe us, we have not and will not leave our citizens in trouble, in poverty or on the streets. We are in total earthquake mobilization with our AFAD, Red Crescent, municipalities, civil society and volunteers. Currently, 160 thousand personnel, including teams from abroad, are actively working in 10 provinces. Our institutions and philanthropists provide hot meals to earthquake victims and aid teams through mobile kitchens and soup kitchens. Our military, police and gendarmerie are working hard to ensure security as well as to distribute aid effectively.
Unfortunately, some groups, be it political parties or NGOs, are still pursuing immoral and impudent attacks even at a time when this unity and solidarity should be at its peak. The moment is the moment of unity, the time to be in unity. And just as we have managed and dealt with many earthquakes, floods and fire disasters so far, this government has the will to handle them today, too, with God's permission, so don't worry.
Ships, planes, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, belonging to our Turkish Armed Forces, other security units, and tens of thousands of construction equipment from all over our country are operating in the region. Despite their different areas of responsibility, thousands of personnel from all our public institutions serve our people in the region with great sacrifice. I would like to thank all our teams and volunteers who fought so bravely despite the cold, frost, insomnia and many other difficulties. We know very well that we cannot pay the dues of those hidden heroes who do not seek publicity, fame, profit or being on the agenda. As the President of Türkiye, I say may God bless them all.
I would also like to express my gratitude to all friendly and brother countries who showed solidarity with our nation by sending search and rescue teams in these difficult days.
My brothers,
No matter how great our pain is, I wholeheartedly believe that we will overcome all these troubles by working together as a state and nation. In addition to our tent cities, which are now widespread in suitable places in each of our cities, we have also started the installation of shelter centers consisting of containers and prefabricated structures. We place earthquake victims who want to go to other provinces in hotels, dormitories and public guesthouses within a certain plan.
Today, I am explaining one more thing here, which is this: We will use the dormitories of all our universities belonging to the Credit and Dormitories Institution for these purposes, because we are currently holidaying our universities once until the summer, and they will continue with completely distance education. And at this point, we will renovate our universities and hopefully use the dormitories of the Credit and Dormitories Institution as guesthouses.
I was in Osmaniye two days ago, the dormitory building with a capacity of 2,200 people is sparkling clean and they hosted all our citizens and earthquake victims in Osmaniye in that dormitory, food and drink, everything is there and I witnessed the happiness of my citizens there. There is currently a capacity of 6 thousand 663 here. Now we will start taking them to our dormitories here in the same way, thus transferring them from tents to here.
We place earthquake victims who want to go to other provinces in hotels, dormitories and public guesthouses within a certain plan. We are also starting to provide moving and rental assistance to our citizens who would prefer to stay by renting a house outside such places and container cities.
Turkish Airlines carries out the transfer of teams going to the earthquake zone and our citizens who want to reach other provinces from there, free of charge, within a certain system.
The March and April summonses of over 13 thousand of our enlisted soldiers residing in the earthquake zone or registered in the population of the earthquake zone provinces have also been postponed to May. In other words, we have achieved such a postponement and pause here by postponing the March and April summons of over 13 thousand of our enlisted soldiers to May.
First; The aid to be sent to the region must be collected and transported in conjunction with AFAD units. We do not have any problems with in-kind aid; these are provided under the coordination of AFAD. Otherwise, there is a danger that this aid will be wasted.
Latter; It is the healthiest and most accurate method for our citizens who want to provide transportation assistance to earthquake victims to do so through AFAD accounts. Unfortunately, even in such dark days, there may be scoundrels who have no sense of humanity enough to attempt to defraud our nation. We declared a state of emergency. Has this been passed by our Parliament? Passed. Now what does this mean? Now, the steps to be taken such as looting or kidnapping, those who do such things should know that the safe hand of the state is on their backs.
Condolence messages and offers of material and moral support continue to come from the international community.
I ask our nation to trust their state and Government. We are a great nation that has overcome many difficulties in its thousand-year history in this geography. We are a state that has overcome many attacks, from invasion attempts to coups and terrorism. We are a country that has repeatedly disappointed those who say it will never be able to stand up again. We are a government that is true to its word and has fulfilled all the commitments it has made to its nation so far. Hopefully we will leave these difficult days behind.
Once again, I express my best wishes to my brothers from Diyarbakır and, with God's permission, we will rebuild and revive these destroyed houses within 1 year.
I pray that God never leaves us face to face with such tests again.
Thank you.

Their Speech in Adıyaman Earthquake Zone,2023-02-10,"

As a nation, we are facing one of the greatest disasters in our history. Unfortunately, we suffered great losses with the consecutive earthquakes of magnitude 7.7 and then magnitude 7.6 on Monday.
First of all, there was serious destruction in 10 provinces. Of course, the day before, we visited Kahramanmaraş, the center of the earthquake, Hatay and Adana provinces and assessed the situation there. Yesterday, I was in Gaziantep, Osmaniye and Kilis, where I assessed the situation and stayed with my earthquake-affected brothers. We are now in Adıyaman and from here we will move to Malatya a little later.
First of all, I would like to express my condolences to Adıyaman and all my brothers from Adıyaman, and I wish a speedy recovery from my Lord to our injured.
I know very well that words are inadequate to describe the pain we are experiencing. Unfortunately, according to the latest findings, the number of our citizens who lost their lives in our 10 provinces increased to 18 thousand 991, and the number of those rescued reached 75 thousand 523. In addition, more than 76 thousand citizens from the region were evacuated and sent to other provinces of our country upon their request.
In Adıyaman, 3 thousand 225 citizens died in 1,944 collapsed buildings, while 12 thousand 432 citizens were rescued with injuries. I pray God's mercy to my deceased brothers. We know that, according to our belief, the rank of those who die in such disasters is martyrdom.
As for the relatives of all our brothers and sisters who lost their lives in the earthquake, I say that we have decided to build all of these buildings within a year, hopefully. I gave the necessary instructions to both our Minister and our relevant units on this matter.
Since the moment of the earthquake, our state has been in the field with all its institutions, personnel, equipment, tools, search-rescue and aid activities. Unfortunately, our job was very difficult as the devastating effect of the earthquake spread to 10 provinces and an area of ​​500 kilometers. Added to this is the fact that most of the public officials who will provide first aid and organization in the region are either themselves or their families under destruction. The fact that the region is experiencing a winter with a severity that we have not seen in recent times has emerged as another obstacle. Some of the roads have been exposed to a serious traffic load due to the ruins caused by the earthquake, some due to weather conditions, and some due to vehicles coming from outside and concentrating inside. Despite all these negativities, we, together with our nation, directed all the resources of our state to the earthquake region under the coordination of AFAD. We mobilized public facilities in all other cities of our country for the earthquake zone.
We decided to declare a disaster area and a state of emergency. With this, some unfortunately ignorant people commit robberies, rob markets, attack workplaces, and some unfortunately pursue abuses. With the state of emergency, the state has taken over the powers in this regard, and in the future, the necessary sanctions will be applied to those who commit these abuses as soon as they are caught.
Of course, there were some shortcomings and disruptions in this process, but our state and nation came to the aid of the earthquake victims with all their resources. For example, in Adıyaman, my Minister of Transport, Mr. Adil, has been here from the very first moment, and later, my Minister Mehmet Muş from Kilis came here after he finished his duty there, and under the leadership of my two ministers, the work here has started to be carried out together with our governors from surrounding provinces and different provinces. .
Our priority has always been people, lives, and we will not allow this to be exploited and our sincerity in this regard cannot be questioned by anyone, God willing. For this reason, these efforts continue with all official and civil search and rescue teams in our country and search and rescue teams from all over the world. So far, teams continue to come to our country within the framework of aid offers from 94 different countries. The destruction affected so many buildings in such a large area that, although we gathered perhaps the largest search and rescue team in the world, with more than 141 thousand people, including approximately 30 thousand trained search and rescue personnel, it is a fact that unfortunately we could not reach the speed we desired.
Our nation is a witness, my dear brothers and sisters; Our state with its ministries, municipalities and all other institutions, all our non-governmental organizations regardless of their views, each of our citizens outside the earthquake zone, and our friends and brothers from all over the world have made every effort to stand by our earthquake victims.
Search and rescue efforts have been completed in Şanlıurfa and Kilis provinces, where the destruction was relatively limited, and debris removal efforts have begun. We continue our search and rescue efforts in our other provinces with determination to leave no building with people underneath.
I would especially like to express this: Within a year, hopefully, we will reconstruct these collapsed buildings with the type of projects we have and deliver them to their owners. By the way, we will give 10 thousand lira to our citizens. In addition to all these, we will enable our citizens who do not or do not want to stay in tents to move into residences by paying the rent. If there are houses available to visit in Adıyaman, my citizens will be able to stay there as of a year, either by renting them or by renting them in different provinces by moving to different provinces, and in the meantime, hopefully we will have built the houses here.
Of course, with all this, we have the efforts of our teams, public officials, civil society members and volunteers who work like bees everywhere in the earthquake zone. We have personally witnessed how our young people struggle to help with the work in the earthquake zone.
Likewise, we have personally witnessed the fortitude of our nation, even though they were unable to enter their homes due to the aftershocks that continued to remain under the earthquake rubble; May God bless my nation.
This nation is a submissive nation. This nation has experienced many such troubles and disasters, but we have always been left alone with them during our 20-year rule. And we experienced these in Van, in Bingöl, in the same way in Elazığ, in Malatya, in the same way, in Giresun, in Kastamonu, in the Izmir earthquake, in all the cities that were shaken by earthquake disasters that I cannot think of right now. We have always been with them and delivered their homes to them by fulfilling our promise on time. We have already started preparations, we have given the necessary instructions to both my Minister and TOKİ, instructing the reserve areas to be identified, construction to be started quickly there, and the debris to be removed from one side.
Meanwhile, of course, there are requests for accommodation in existing hotels from different places. Here too, if our citizens want to settle there, we can settle them there.
Our Turkish Airlines and other airlines are free of charge for both the outgoing aid teams and the earthquake victims coming from there. I would like to underline this. Turkish Airlines has to bring both the departing and the arriving free of charge, and they have been given the necessary instructions. Let my nation watching us on their screens be aware of this.
We provide hot meals to earthquake victims and our aid teams through mobile kitchens, soup kitchens and volunteers.
Our army, police and gendarmerie take an active role in both ensuring security and carrying out aid activities. Currently, 26 ships, 75 aircraft, 81 helicopters, as well as more than 12 thousand construction machines of all kinds belonging to our Turkish Armed Forces and other security units are working in the region day and night.
Of course, in the meantime, I, my people, all my citizens, please do not believe them, regardless of the institution, organization or political party that exploits this matter, both in the earthquake zone and outside the region. At such a time, in such a situation, at a time when there should be unity and solidarity, do not give credit to those who exploit this. Because this nation is noble, I hope it will give the necessary answer to such degenerates in the necessary time.
Currently, aid supplies are pouring into the earthquake zone from all over our country and abroad. May God bless everyone who sent this aid. Aid in the earthquake zone must be collected, sent and distributed within a certain plan, otherwise the efforts will be wasted.
I call out to all my citizens from here again; Please do not randomly collect aid and send it on the road without contacting AFAD or other institutions, especially the Red Crescent, which carries out regional aid activities. Because the biggest problem in the region right now is; It is to ensure the logistics of the traffic caused by tens of thousands of vehicles coming from outside and the aid they carry. We know that there is no problem with basic needs. It is very important to meet the needs that will continue in the coming days, weeks and months with a planned and conscious aid activity. Providing cash aid through AFAD is a method that will eliminate abuses and hesitations. Every penny of the donations made to AFAD accounts by people from all walks of life, from our business world to our MPs, from our students to our tradesmen, is spent for activities in the earthquake zone.
In the process of rebuilding our cities with their hundreds of thousands of houses, infrastructure and superstructure, we will need the support of both our nation and the world, as well as the state treasury. I have no doubt that everyone with a generous heart will support the state in this process with the contribution they can make.
Our state has been there before, I repeat; If the wounds were healed as soon as possible in the earthquakes in Elazığ, Malatya, İzmir and Van, the fires in Antalya and Muğla, the floods in Kastamonu, Sinop, Bartın and Giresun, in short, other disasters, I hope we are able to do the same here. In this context, in the first stage, we will provide the support I have just mentioned from the AFAD emergency aid allowance, and we are preparing to provide 15 thousand liras per household, including moving aid. We hope to provide rent assistance, especially to those of our citizens in these households who will be housed outside of container cities. We will continue to expand this assistance in a way that will not cause any of our citizens to suffer.
I believe that as long as we act in unity and solidarity as a nation, we will overcome this test with success, with God's permission. We first started by extinguishing the fire in our hearts, and we are preparing a comprehensive program that will enable the country to get back on its feet, especially in the earthquake zone. We will not allow those who plunder while our nation groans under the earthquake ruins, nor will we allow opportunists who want to turn this pain into political plunder.
Once again, I would like to express my best wishes to my brothers from Adıyaman. May God not let our people face such difficult tests again.
I would like to thank our teams, volunteers and non-governmental organizations who have worked devotedly both in Adıyaman and in other provinces since the first moments of the earthquake.
On behalf of myself, my nation and my country, I would like to express my gratitude to all friendly and brotherly countries who came to the aid of our nation by saying that a friend can be seen on a dark day.
Thank you.

Speech from the State Information Coordination Center regarding the Earthquake,2023-02-07,"

My Dear Nation,
Dear Press Members,
I greet you with love and respect. As a nation, we are experiencing the most painful days in our history.
Two major earthquakes centered in Pazarcık and Elbistan districts of Kahramanmaraş caused great destruction in 10 provinces in a wide area where approximately 13.5 million citizens live. While the intensity of the Pazarcık-centered earthquake, which occurred at 04:17 in the morning, was 7.7 according to monent tensor analysis, the intensity of the Elbistan-centered earthquake, which occurred at 13:24, was measured as 7.6. Experts describe these two earthquakes as exceptional ground movements that are independent of each other but trigger each other and have no precedent in the world.
Both earthquakes occurred at a distance of 7 kilometers from the earth, which increased the severity of the destruction exponentially. Due to the width of the ruptured faults, these earthquakes caused great destruction in a much wider area compared to their counterparts. Therefore, we are faced with one of the greatest disasters not only in the history of our Republic, but also in our geography and the world. Our state, with all its institutions, organizations, personnel, vehicles, equipment and means, started to work in disaster areas with the spirit of mobilization from the first moment of the earthquake.
Considering the devastating effect of the earthquake spreading to our 10 provinces, we instructed our expert personnel and vehicles from all over our country to immediately move to the region. Despite the difficulties caused by the weather conditions, our teams fought selflessly to reach the disaster area and participate in the work. The dangers posed by numerous aftershocks to damaged buildings also negatively affect the work. Regardless of the difficulty of the conditions, we rapidly continue our search and rescue efforts with the support of our citizens and volunteers, using all the resources of our state. Currently, 53 thousand 317 search and rescue officers and support personnel are working in the debris area, and this number is increasing every hour with additional teams coming from home and abroad. Many more public officials, non-governmental organization officials and volunteers are also taking part in aid efforts.
We are also taking step by step measures to meet all the needs of disaster victims who survived the earthquake, from shelter to clothing, from food to heating. So far, 54 thousand tents, 102 thousand beds and other necessary materials have been sent to the region to be delivered to disaster victims. We appointed additional governors and district governors to support our current administrators in each province where the disaster occurred.
All of the managers of public institutions in the 81 provinces of our country are making intense efforts to work on the earthquake zone in their own cities. In addition, a minister in each province oversees the activities carried out. Our Vice President Fuat Oktay also coordinates the work at AFAD Center. We follow the developments moment by moment through the Presidential Crisis Center, in constant contact with our friends in the field, and take the necessary interventions. In the first stage, we allocated a resource of 100 billion to our institutions for emergency aid and support activities.
As I stated at the press conference we held at AFAD yesterday, it is vital to keep transportation and communication lines open. Due to the harsh winter conditions, there are still difficulties in delivering search and rescue teams, equipment and aid materials to the earthquake region. For this reason, I would like to remind you again that no one should use the roads leading to or within the earthquake zone unless necessary, and that phone calls should not be made except for urgent needs. We allocated some of our airports in the region only to aid flights. In the field of health, nearly a thousand ambulances, 241 UMKE teams and a total of 5 thousand medical personnel on duty in two ambulance aircraft were transferred to the region.
Our citizens all over our country donate blood to ensure that our stocks are kept strong in case of need. Many personnel from our security forces, members of our Ministry of Internal Affairs and Turkish Armed Forces, were assigned to search and rescue operations. In addition to thousands of personnel in the land elements, our Turkish Armed Forces is involved in search and establishment, evacuation and transportation of aid materials with all its resources, including 10 ships of our navy and 54 high-capacity cargo planes of our air force.
Our Police Department is already on the field with all its elements. In addition to thousands of expert personnel, our Gendarmerie is on duty everywhere in the disaster area with its 26 cargo planes and our Coast Guard Command with its ships and boats. Our security guards also actively participate in these activities.
We also activated our unmanned aerial vehicles for faster and more detailed detection of the effects of the earthquake over a wide area.
Thousands of volunteers with search and rescue training and equipment from all over our country flock to the region under the coordination of AFAD.
In addition to the units affiliated to our ministries, all our municipalities, regardless of party, send their tools and aid materials to the region. Thousands of construction equipment that will take part in the restoration of the infrastructure are on the move towards the region from all over our country. We are close witnesses to the sincere efforts of our non-governmental organizations from the first moment of the earthquake.
As progress is made in search and rescue efforts, unfortunately, the number of dead and injured also increases. We currently have 3 thousand 549 deaths and 22 thousand 168 injured. Our greatest consolation is that more than 8 thousand of our citizens have been rescued alive from the rubble so far. The injured, who are taken out from under the rubble, are sent to hospitals in other parts of our country, especially Mersin, Istanbul and Ankara, and receive treatment after their first intervention in the region.
May God have mercy on our citizens who lost their lives, my condolences to their relatives and our nation, and I wish a speedy recovery to our injured.
In respect to the pain our nation suffered from this great disaster we have experienced, we declared national mourning for a week, starting from yesterday until next Sunday.
My Dear Nation,
While search and rescue efforts in the region continue, each of our institutions takes additional measures regarding their areas of responsibility and announces them to the public. In this context, education was suspended in schools across the country until February 13, and in schools in the disaster area until February 20.
In the public sector, especially all suitable buildings were allocated for the shelter needs of disaster victims. Necessary plans are being made to provide services to disaster victims in hotels that have already suspended their operations due to the winter season, starting from places close to the disaster area. 50 thousand beds have been prepared for this purpose in the Antalya region alone.
Efforts are continuing to ensure a controlled supply of electricity and natural gas flows, which have been cut off due to damage to distribution lines or as a precaution. Satellite transmission terminals were sent to the region to ensure that there was no interruption in communication. Arrangements are being made to ensure traffic flow in places where there is destruction that causes transportation disruption.
While the state and the nation are working together to overcome this historical disaster, we are closely monitoring those who intend to pit our people against each other with false news and distortions. This is not the day to argue with them. When the day comes, we will open the notebook we are currently keeping. Our prosecutors identify those who attempt to cause social chaos with such inhumane methods and quickly take the necessary action.
So far, we have received offers of assistance from 70 different countries and 14 international organizations. We met with 18 heads of state and government who called us on the phone. I would like to thank all our friends, all heads of state and government who called us, sent messages, and made statements to convey their support and offer of help on this difficult day for our country. The support of the international community is valuable to us for its moral impact rather than the nature of the aid received. I would also like to express my gratitude to each and every one of our brothers and sisters all over our geography who volunteer to support our nation with their prayers.
I invite our citizens and business world who want to help heal the earthquake wounds to donate to AFAD accounts. No fee will be charged for transfers made to AFAD's Turkish Lira and foreign currency accounts in all leading banks and participation companies in our country.
However, the gravity of the earthquake disaster we are experiencing and its effects make it necessary for us to take extraordinary measures. We declare the 10 provinces where the earthquake occurred as disaster areas affecting general life. In order to ensure that search and rescue activities and subsequent work can be carried out quickly, we decided to declare a state of emergency, based on the authority given to us by Article 119 of the Constitution. We will quickly complete the Presidential and Parliamentary processes regarding this decision, which will cover 10 provinces where the earthquake occurred and will last three months.
My Dear Nation,
Aware that we are experiencing one of the biggest disasters not only in our country but also in the world, we strive to mobilize all the resources of the country and the nation in a planned and effective manner. Of course, there are places where we cannot reach the desired speed in search-rescue and aid efforts due to reasons such as the size of the disaster area, the severity of the destruction, and adverse weather conditions. But our citizens affected by the disaster should be sure that; The state is working with all its might to lend a hand to him, to save his life, to make his life easier. Overcoming the difficulties one by one, we charge to the field with a determination that will leave no ruin unreached, no debris unmoved, no need unmet. As a country that has overcome many challenges with state-nation solidarity, we will hopefully overcome the destruction caused by the earthquake disaster. Our priority; To speed up search and rescue efforts and to deliver emergency aid. Then, we will quickly begin debris removal and then reconstruction activities.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Meanwhile, Qatar is currently preparing to send 10 thousand containers to our country. Likewise, in addition to the many containers to which we will provide urgent aid, caravans are also reaching the center in many places, and we will allocate these caravans to families in urgent need.
May God help our country and nation.
Thank you.

Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2019-06-25,"

My Dear Nation,
Dear Members of Parliament,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to God that our Group Meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country. I hope that the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality renewal election held on Sunday will bring good things to our city and our country. I congratulate once again CHP candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu, who was elected as the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality according to unofficial results.
The decision of the people of Istanbul has a special place in our heads. As it is known, regarding the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayoral election in the March 31 elections, problems were detected in both the assembly minutes and ballot box committees that would affect the result. Thereupon, the Supreme Electoral Council decided to renew the metropolitan elections. Of course, in these elections, our party won the election with an overwhelming majority in both the municipal council and the metropolitan city. The commission elections that followed were completely won by the AK Party. Our friends took office as vice presidents. Of course, the process we have experienced so far is a completely legal process. Of course, we wanted the People's Alliance candidate Binali Bey to win the election. I would like to thank him for his efforts and struggle.
Mr. Binali started his journey of serving his nation, which he started as a bureaucrat in Istanbul, and has continued until today as a member of parliament, minister, Prime Minister and Speaker of the Parliament. He was a candidate for the Metropolitan Municipality Mayor to implement all his years of knowledge, experience, and projects, but this is how the people of Istanbul appreciated him. I would like to underline and reiterate that what is really important for us is the manifestation of the national will in the healthiest, safest and most uneventful way. Beyond who won the last election, it is valuable in itself because it eliminates hesitations about the manifestation of the national will.
The winner of March 31, the real election across Turkey, is unquestionably the People's Alliance, AK Party and MHP. Our nation supported us throughout the country in the March 31 elections with a rate of approximately 60 percent in the Provincial General Assembly, 52 percent in the Metropolitan Municipalities, and 55 percent in the Provincial Municipalities. In Istanbul, as the People's Alliance, we achieved another undisputed victory by winning 25 of 39 districts and 180 of 312 municipal council seats. This is especially important in Istanbul in the metropolitan elections, that is, it is important in terms of where we came from in the local elections since 2004. 45.3 percent in 2004. In 2009, it was 44.7 percent. We received 47.9 percent of the votes in 2014. Last Sunday, our vote rate was 45 percent, but this rate was not enough for us to win. Until the 2024 elections, as AK Party and MHP, we will strive to provide the best services to our people with the 25 district municipalities and 180 Metropolitan Municipality council members we have in Istanbul. Likewise, as the President, ministries and institutions, we will continue to implement our projects, investments and goals regarding Istanbul. We will hopefully walk on this path until our last breath, seeing it as our greatest honor to serve this city to which we have a deep love. Now, we have a four-year uninterrupted action period for the Presidency and Parliament and a five-year period for municipalities. From now on, we will continue our work by concentrating all our work and strength on the upcoming agenda. In our understanding of politics, there is never any way to be angry with the nation, to be offended by the nation, and especially to blame the nation. On the contrary, we will take account of why we could not explain ourselves to our nation both on March 31 and June 23. We will identify where there are deficiencies, disconnections and inaccuracies in each area and look for ways to eliminate them. According to the results of this evaluation, we will take the steps we need to take with determination, but we have the power to make our definitions together within ourselves, not according to the definitions made by outsiders.
We do not have the luxury of turning a deaf ear and ignoring the messages given by our nation. In this regard, I want all my brothers who love the People's Alliance, our Party and us to be comforted. As Yunus Emre said;
We loved and fell in love, we were loved and became beloved.
We are always newly born, who can get tired of us?
Yes, we will continue to work as long as God gives us life and strength to be worthy of our nation's love and trust.
Dear friends,
Since the day it was founded, the AK Party has been a movement based on the superiority of the national will, walking on the path shown by the nation, and working for our common goals. In this way, we have found the support of our nation in every struggle we have entered for 17 years. When tutelage forces came against us and even tried to prevent us from electing a President, we sought refuge in our nation. We have always taken the strength from our nation to continue the struggle when our development moves were tried to be sabotaged. When they attacked us internationally to isolate us, we said one munite together with our nation.
When they set their sights on our unity and solidarity by disrupting the streets during the Gezi events, we broke this game together with our nation.
When the FETO treason gang attempted a coup through its extensions within the police and judiciary, we stood together with our nation against the scoundrels.
We crushed the heads of the terrorists together with our nation when they unleashed terrorist organizations such as PKK and DAESH on us and tried to drown the cities of our country in blood and fire.
When an attempt was made to surround our borders using terrorist organizations, we, together with our nation, broke the chains drawn to our south. Likewise, when they tried to invade our country with their tanks, artillery, planes, helicopters and weapons on July 15, we prevented the coup together with our nation.
Together with our nation, we are facing the traps in the economy that continue in parallel with all these events, but became an open attack last August. Attacks on Turkey's atmosphere of stability and trust, which they have never been able to destroy, continued yesterday, continue today, and will continue tomorrow. No matter what anyone does, we will continue to move forward with determination towards our own goals together with our nation. We work day and night for this. For example, we currently have a one-week trip to Japan and China for the G-20 Meeting and an official visit tomorrow, Wednesday. Following the visit to Japan, we are making this visit to China. At the G-20, we will discuss our bilateral relations and the world's economic and political agenda with the leaders of the most developed countries and representatives of global institutions. We will hold meetings to contribute to the growth of the Turkish economy in harmony with the world. We will discuss these discussions intensively there with our ministers.
We continue our multifaceted pursuit of Turkey's security needs. In this context, we hope to start receiving the S-400 Air Defense Systems we ordered next month. Our doors have always been open to different supply options regarding our security needs. Turkey does not have to negotiate with any country on the issue of meeting its own security needs, get permission on this issue, and especially not bow down to pressure. The S-400 issue is directly related to our sovereign rights and we will not step back from it.
We will express our country's views at the Southeastern European Countries Cooperation Initiative Summit in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July. We will attend the United Nations General Assembly in September, as every year. In addition to representing our country in the General Assembly, we will hold many bilateral meetings with heads of state and government from all over the world. The tension in the Gulf is a source of great threat not only for our country but for the whole world. We are doing our part to leave this tension behind by respecting the rights and laws of the countries in the region. We support all initiatives that will turn the ongoing trade war between China and America into a direction that will turn it into a profitable direction for everyone. We continue to oppose in the loudest voice the policies of hostility carried out worldwide against Islam, Muslims and the Turks, who are seen as their greatest representatives. We have not and will not make the slightest concession in our determination to express the violations against the privacy of Jerusalem and the rights of Palestinians on every platform.
Dear friends,
Turkey, which develops and develops in every field, naturally constantly faces new and greater challenges. In the face of these tests, we always preferred to challenge, instead of acting coy and retreating into our shell as in the past.
At a time when such critical developments that concern our region and the world are taking place, someone is trying to confine our country to itself again. The goal is to push Turkey out of the reorganized global game. Since we saw this intention from the very beginning, we made our preparations. We have demonstrated our stance by not making the slightest compromise on our policies regarding our country's basic diplomatic, security and economic priorities, and by not succumbing to any threats.
We are taking determined steps to neutralize the separatist terrorist organization at home and abroad. With our operations, we have achieved success in preventing terrorist threats against our country from Northern Iraq at their source. We foiled all the attacks of the terrorist organization against our gains in Syria. We have failed all efforts to make Turkey a part of the crisis and destruction in our region. The statements made by the terrorist leader in Imrali to the public in recent days and the evaluations regarding them are signs that serious differences of opinion have emerged within the organization, both in domestic and regional policies. One by one, we have foiled and are disrupting the schemes aimed at resurrecting the DAESH terrorist organization and unleashing it on us.
We will continue the steps we have taken in the region with determination until we gain consent to the fair sharing of all kinds of natural resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. Look, we will never allow initiatives that ignore the rights, laws and interests of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots regarding oil and natural gas exploration activities in this basin.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Of course, we did not have such drilling or exploration ships in the past, but if you can find them around the world through rental systems, you will rent them and come and carry out this work. But thank God, we now have 4 such ships, both exploration and drilling ships. Now, with these ships, we have started to continue our work in the Eastern Mediterranean and the process continues increasingly. Of course, along with all these, we also carry out their protection and security together with the relevant units of our Armed Forces.
The Greek Prime Minister keeps saying things of his own. No matter what he says, we have rights there, and in the same way, both our exploration and drilling ships will continue their activities in order to protect these rights, and our Armed Forces have taken, are taking and will take the necessary precautions.
Of course, those who are engaged in politics in our country, so-called politicians, are or may criticize us as to why we are taking such steps at this point. But they do not have such a problem, they do not have such a problem, so what are the rights of my compatriots in Northern Cyprus? Are these rights given to them or is there any sensitivity about these rights? They don't have such a problem, but we have a problem. We say that our compatriots have rights to whatever oil and natural gas is produced in that region, and the involvement of the Northern Cypriot administrators in determining and investigating these rights is the thesis we have defended from the very beginning.
And I have always said one thing: France has nothing to say about this place. Here, Turkey speaks and is the guarantor, Greece speaks and is the guarantor, England speaks and is the guarantor. But France, you cannot speak, you do not have such authority. And if there are people here who are interested in water, they may also have something to say. But when it comes to Cyprus, there are three guarantor countries, but they can talk.
We have pushed, are pushing and will push to the end the political, diplomatic and military solutions that will ensure that the crisis in Syria is resolved to a solution that will eliminate our country's security concerns and humanitarian burdens. As you know right now, the most important issue here was a terrorist corridor incident. We eliminated this terror corridor with our interventions. Right now, we want to turn this terror corridor into a security corridor, and for this purpose, let's provide settlement opportunities for refugees in Turkey in this security corridor. And with this settlement opportunity, those who are talking, those who say 'we are coalition forces', we are this and that, okay, come on then, come on, give your support, let's establish settlements for them in this security corridor together, let's try to settle them there. In this regard, let America come and support us with its logistics support and air guards. We carry out these infrastructure and superstructure works intensively at the settlement point, especially with TIKA, where our experience is very advanced. I told these to many Western countries, especially Obama, I told him in the past, I told Mr. I talked about these with Ms. Merkel, and she said that she could provide such support at this point and that this project was appropriate, but there was no development from there. Likewise, I met with Saud and he said so too. He said these when we talked to him after the G-20 Meeting in China, but there is no sound from there either. They always say, just talk and come back, unfortunately nothing happens after that.
And of course, despite all this, we are trying to expand the safe zones beyond our borders as much as possible to ensure the return of Syrians currently in our country. So far, 330 thousand people have returned. I believe that this figure will reach millions in a short time when we solve the problems in Manbij and the east of the Euphrates.
In this whole picture, our nation, with its will in the June 24 and March 31 elections, said to the AK Party and the Nationalist Movement Party, with which we act in the same alliance, that we should not stop, continue on our way. We have 2023 goals ahead of us that we need to work really hard to achieve. Hopefully, we will definitely achieve these goals by overcoming the obstacles we encounter, breaking the shackles that are tried to put on our feet, and working day and night.
Dear friends,
Economy and security issues will again be at the top of our agenda in the coming period. Turkey's main goal in the economy is to develop production and exports based on high technology, design, branding and high added value.
Unfortunately, some so-called politicians in Turkey are trying to make a profit by belittling the steps we have taken in education, they are trying to make a profit by belittling the steps we have taken in healthcare, they are trying to make a profit by belittling the steps we have taken in justice and security, they are trying to make a premium by belittling the steps we have taken in transportation. That's what someone says today, this is what he says: ""Are you going to get votes by saying I built so many divided roads?"" On the other hand, tell me this: Will this nation vote for you because we brought a high-speed train? Or I'm going even further: Will this nation vote for you because we increased the number of airports from 26 to 56? What's left, that won't happen, that won't happen, what will happen? Then why do you exist, why do you exist? So what do political staff do in this country?
Now, I would like to show you a beautiful image of one of our citizens on the screen. He understood, but the so-called politician, I won't name any names, couldn't understand. I guess he'll understand it too if he gets the chance to watch it. Let's get into it right away.
My brother from Kahramanmaraş understood this, but this lady still could not understand. This is one of course, hundreds of tunnels, we pierced the mountains with hundreds of tunnels, alhamdulillah, we came here. Why couldn't they do this until now? Why do you feel uncomfortable doing it now? You should also say that knowledge is a compliment and say thank you. No, it is your duty. Okay, but you have also served as ministers and ministers in the past, why couldn't you do these things, why couldn't you do them? Jealousy is a very bad disease. But whether they want it or not, we will continue to build these roads, hopefully we will continue to open these tunnels, we will continue to build bridges, we will also build the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, we will also build the Osman Gazi Bridge, we will also build the likes of Marmaray, we will also build the Eurasia Tunnel. , we will continue to do so.
My brothers,
In addition to all this, we are well aware of how economic traps aimed at darkening and hindering the future of our country overwhelm our nation in its daily life. We know very well what difficulties our entrepreneurs, businessmen, tradesmen and employees go through when they are overwhelmed by the triangle of exchange rate, interest and inflation. For this purpose, we are trying to stabilize the economy, eliminate the instability in the exchange rate, reduce interest rates, reduce inflation to single digits again, and increase employment. Hopefully, the signals of this have started to come. It is clear that we cannot bring production, investment, trade and employment to the level we want without ensuring stability in the economy. Those who know Turkey's potential, capacity and capabilities in production and manpower always focus their attacks on our country's economy on this point of stability.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We took and continue to take precautions accordingly. Since last year, we have been implementing a program that targets healthy, sustainable and balanced growth that is resistant to shocks, stronger in international competition. With God's help and the foresight of our nation, we will hopefully soon see our economy begin to rise again. Despite everything, we grew by 2.6 percent last year, and we closed the first quarter of this year with a growth of 1.3 percent compared to the previous quarter, when we look at the seasonal effect, despite the annual contraction. As of June, indicators in every field point to a positive rise. The dollar exchange rate has been below 6 lira for a while, our Central Bank foreign exchange reserves have approached the level of 100 billion dollars again, the stock market has increased from 86 thousand to over 95 thousand in a month, bond interest rates have fallen below 19 percent, our country risk premium is declining. There is a positive increase in all confidence indices that measure the pulse of the economy in June.
There is also an increase in capacity utilization rates in the manufacturing industry. The positive rise in our exports and tourism sector continues. Hopefully, we will exceed 170 in exports and over 50 million tourists in tourism, God willing, this is the current picture. This situation also caused the current account deficit to decrease tremendously. In fact, we expect to have an annualized current account surplus as of this month.
We left behind the problems in employment in 2018 and started to increase especially since March. Hopefully, we will not only compensate for our losses as soon as possible, but also reach a much more advanced level.
The interest of international investors in our country continues to increase. Almost every day, our relevant institutions hold meetings about new investments and organize programs.
In short, we do not give opportunity to those who try to corner Turkey through regional crises and domestic political developments. I believe that, God willing, we will share some good news with you again after the G-20 and China trip.
We continue the structural reforms in the economy uninterruptedly. We announced our judicial reform strategy document, which reveals our country's will to raise its standards in terms of democracy and justice, at the end of last month, and now we are finalizing the work and we will immediately share it with you and send it to our Parliament.
There are many reform regulations on the agenda of our Turkish Grand National Assembly, especially the new military system. As you know, our Minister of Defense visited the Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, the Chairman of the İyi Party and the Chairman of the Republican People's Party as of yesterday and informed them in detail about this issue. And they no longer have the opportunity to say, ""We didn't know this or that"" about this issue. Now, wherever there are problems, they have heard them personally from our Minister of Defense.
I hope that the new military service regulation, which will provide great convenience for our young people in planning their lives, will be beneficial.
This regulation will also enable our Turkish Armed Forces to strengthen its professional structure and plan its committed resources more systematically.
Each of our ministries and institutions is working to achieve our 2023 goals in their own fields. As you can see, we continue to work, produce, solve problems and realize new breakthroughs for our country and nation. We are determined to give the best answer to those who aim to disrupt Turkey's stability with our actions, reforms and achievements. For this reason, I would like to remind once again an issue that we repeat at every opportunity. My brothers, we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together. When we achieve this, there is no problem that we cannot overcome, with God's permission.
Dear friends;
As a party founded by our nation itself, the AK Party has provided comprehensive services that reach each of the 81 provinces and 82 million people during its 17-year rule. In our world, there is absolutely no place for discrimination, marginalization, belittling people, and mapping the country according to regions, origins, and temperament. Just as we believe in unity in diversity, we are also convinced that there can be no diversity without unity.
My brothers,
It's not about embracing with words, it's about action and we did it. Here is the Southeast, here is the East, who was there as a party here? Apart from the certain party, we have always been there, we are still there today, and hopefully we will be there tomorrow too. We have grown, strengthened and enriched our country by seeing our differences as wealth and succeeding in mobilizing all members of our nation. All our citizens, without exception, have benefited from every service we have provided to our country and every investment we have made so far.
Some people are tweeting about bringing different opportunities for the Kurds. What didn't we bring, what didn't we bring? They have eyes but they cannot see. I advise them to go and visit the Southeast. Visit Şanlıurfa, visit Gaziantep, visit Diyarbakır, visit Siirt, visit Mardin. Go and see what the situation here is today compared to 10 years ago. While some people were burning and destroying our schools, burning and destroying our mosques, and creating tunnels under the houses to terrorize those places in their own way, who saved all these places from these terrorist attacks? We were. Who brought our schools back to their feet? We were. Who rebuilt our mosques and put them at the service of our people? We were. Who built all the roads with their infrastructure and superstructure? We were.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
If we had put our Kurdish brothers aside, we would never have visited those places like those before us, but we did. Why? Because this country is ours, this country is ours with 780 thousand square kilometers, there can be no discrimination here. We embraced 82 million people, made them brothers, and brought this service everywhere, and we will continue to do so. In the coming period, we will give priority to works that will touch the daily lives of every person without exception, make their work easier, and increase their level of welfare. We will do whatever is necessary to strengthen the bridges of our hearts with our brothers from every origin, every region, every disposition and every opinion, without any discrimination. We will run to anyone who takes one step closer to us. As we always do, we will continue to walk towards wherever our nation points us and work for whatever it demands from us.
We will act according to the headlines of our nation, not the headlines of the media. Instead of being tempted to deviate from the paths imposed on our country, we will move towards our own goals, even if it is difficult. In this critical period that the world is going through, we will not miss the opportunities that will come to societies, perhaps once in a hundred years, as in the past, but we will definitely take advantage of them.
Considering the reforms, projects, investments and services that Turkey has made in the last 17 years as a starting point, we will work with all our strength to achieve greater ones. Instead of wasting our time on useless political conflicts that tire our nation, we are determined to use it to bequeath the visions of 2053 and 2071 to our children. We will be the companion of everyone who takes action with sincere intentions to serve our people. We will stand by everyone who has ideas, knowledge and efforts to ensure that our country develops, develops and rises above the level of contemporary civilization. Just as we have supported every positive initiative, no matter how big or small, no matter how small or small, no matter how ordinary or extraordinary, we will continue to support it from now on. We will mobilize all means to provide a better life for all members of this country, men and women, young and old, and to make their dreams come true, because we love this country. Because we are in love with this nation. There is no knot that love cannot solve, no obstacle that love cannot overcome. There is no stopping or resting for us until we reach the destination of this blessed journey we are walking with you.
Before I end my words, I would like to make a reminder about the June 24 elections, the first anniversary of which we reached yesterday. With these elections, Turkey has completed the transition to the Presidential Government System, which is the biggest management reform in its history, and has started to operate it with all its elements. Of course, it will take time for such a major reform to be implemented and implemented. However, in general terms, we see that our nation has accepted this system and our country has adapted. We initiated a comprehensive study within the Presidency on the results of the one-year implementation of the new management system, its shortcomings, shortcomings and aspects that need to be improved. We will carry out this evaluation study with the participation of our ministries, institutions, academics, media members and all relevant segments under the coordination of our Vice President Fuat Oktay, and hopefully we will share the results with our nation.
On this occasion, I would like to once again express my gratitude to our nation for its support of our new management system. With these feelings, I wish you success in your Parliamentary work.
Stay healthy.

Dear World Eye Hospitals Group Family,
Dear Professors,
Dear Businessmen,
Artists,
athletes,
Ladies,
Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank our brother Eray Kapıcıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dünya Göz Hospitals Group, for bringing us together around this beautiful table today.
I wish success to Dünya Eye Group, which has become an important brand in the field of eye diseases in our country and in the world with its activities for nearly a quarter of a century, in its future endeavors.
World Eye Group, which serves an average of 60 thousand foreign patients every year in addition to our citizens, is among the 500 largest service exporters of our country. This group of hospitals is one of the examples of what Turkish people can achieve when they work with determination and do not give up the struggle. I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Eray and his entire team for their contributions to our country.
In addition to our industrialists and manufacturers, the service sector, especially the health sector, has great responsibilities in helping Turkey achieve its 2023 targets. Our country's potential, infrastructure, trained human resources and practicality of doing business put our businessmen not one, but 3-5 steps ahead in every field we focus on. We strive to utilize this great advantage in every field, from the service sector to the defense industry, from textile to tourism. Thank God, the business world we support and stand behind does not embarrass us and makes us all proud with its successes. Likewise, our artists and athletes are achieving successes that make our country proud.
For a long time, efforts have been made to diminish the productivity, skills, innovation and design aspects of the country's people. After all the years we wasted with political, social, cultural and economic fights within ourselves, I believe that we have finally entered a period in which we can reveal our true power and true potential. Even what we have experienced in the last 6 years is enough to show that there is no difficulty that this nation cannot overcome if it protects its unity, solidarity and brotherhood.
If any of these troubles, ranging from attacks by terrorist organizations to coup attempts and economic traps, had happened to a European country, rest assured, it would have been destroyed. But thank God, Türkiye emerged from every test it faced by increasing its strength. Every challenge we have overcome and every operation we have failed has strengthened the strength of our state. Of course, we may encounter losses of life and some problems in the economy in the fight against terrorism. But let's not forget that being a martyr is not an ordinary event. In Akif's words, ""If you squeeze the soil, shuheda will gush out, shuheda!"" ""Let God take my soul, my soul, all that I have, and don't let the world destroy me from my only homeland."" This is so important. And reaching such a position is not the profit of every brave man, but the profit of a private man.
There is a direct relationship between the situation our country is trying to be reduced to and the prices we pay. I've always said it, I'll say it again, they will run away, we will chase them, we entered their lairs, we will continue to enter their dens. Because no one has the right to disturb the peace of this beloved nation. Therefore, we will continue this struggle determinedly until peace and prosperity are found. In recent days and weeks, you have seen and heard how those at the highest levels of terrorists have been neutralized.
Dear Friends,
82 million of us will continue to fight firmly against those who want to Middle Easternize, Balkanize, and perhaps even Africanize. Maybe we will continue to pay the price, but there is no doubt that we will succeed in leaving a much stronger, more independent Turkey to our children, where they can realize their 2023, 2053 and 2071 visions. The way to do this is for each of us to do our own job in the best way possible. Are we academics? We will open new horizons for our country with our works and research. Are we educators? We will strive to provide the best education to new generations. Are we healthcare professionals? We will strive to provide the most advanced health services to our nation and all humanity. Are we industrialists, businessmen, tradesmen? We will strive to make the best production and achieve the best service quality. Are we artists or athletes? We will work to become number one in our field by improving ourselves in the best way possible. Dünya Eye Group is one of the best examples of doing its job well. I know that there are many more successful examples among us in every field. Hopefully, we will spread this understanding to our entire nation, from the top to the bottom. We will ensure that especially our young people prepare themselves for life with this approach. This is called the struggle for the great and powerful Türkiye. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for the support you have given us in this struggle.
Dear friends,
Just as everyone has a job, it is the job of politicians to govern the country, put forward the vision required for this, and carry out the actions. Politics is not a profession, it is the name of dedication to serving the country and the nation. Whoever engages in politics for other purposes is, first of all, unfair to his country and nation. In our political struggle of more than 40 years, we have always strived to move our country and nation forward with the strength we received from the civilization and history we belong to. We worked day and night to better serve all of our people. It is the nation that provides the politician with the power and opportunity necessary for his struggle, supervises him, and liquidates him when necessary. For this reason, we have always opposed tutelage, political engineering, and the rude understanding that sees itself above the national will. We have come to this day with our political struggle, expecting help from God and support from the nation. We have always complied with the elections, the ballot box, and the will that emerged from the ballot box, and we have never harmed the trust of the nation.
Thank God, our nation has never left us alone since 1994. First, he gave this brother of his the task of serving Istanbul as the Metropolitan Mayor. Then, as the Prime Minister, we reached the authority of serving our 81 provinces. As President, we took this service journey to the top with the new management system. We emerged victorious in the latest March 31 elections with a rate of approximately 60 percent in provincial councils, 52 percent in metropolitan municipalities, and 55 percent in provincial mayors throughout Turkey. In Istanbul, as the People's Alliance, we unquestionably won by winning 25 of 30 districts and 180 of 312 Municipal Council members. Currently, all commissions of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Council belong to the AK Party and the People's Alliance. In addition, all of the commissions currently belong to the People's Alliance. Thus, it is obvious that the AK Party and the People's Alliance are under the control of the AK Party, with its commissions and parliament, in terms of management. The deputy presidents also belong to the People's Alliance.
I want to express something with this; Here, apart from Sunday's election, everything is actually over as the People's Alliance. Now there is only a presidential event on display, but something that is missing will be completed.
There are some things being said. For example, you have owned the municipality for 25 years, what have you done? A person must be blind to say this. First of all, when I first became the Mayor of Istanbul, I think all my brothers here know, we all know how filthy Istanbul is with its mountains of garbage, and you also know how we cleaned Istanbul from these mountains of garbage in a short time.
And it was at the end of the first year, an international meeting was held in Cemal Reşit Rey Hall, which belongs to world environmentalism, that is, the Habitat-2 Summit, and the following was included in the final declaration of that summit: Istanbul is the cleanest city in the world.
Dear Friends,
This didn't happen by lying around, it happened by working. And at this point, with the steps we took and the work we did, we made Istanbul sparkling at that time.
It's not over, as you all know, Istanbul was thirsty, it was like an oasis, it had become like this. And we were filling the bathtubs with water, we were buying water from gas stations as if we were getting gas, and we were bringing those cans and filling them into the bathtubs. We all experienced this together, let's refresh our memories. But does a 30-year-old or a 31-year-old know about those mountains of garbage? He doesn't know. Does he know thirst? He doesn't know. Does he know about air pollution? He doesn't know that either. Think about it, we brought water to Terkos by drilling 140 kilometers from the Istranca Mountains and drilled the mountains. And we didn't stop there, we brought water 210 kilometers from Melen to Ömerli. We didn't stop there, we built tubes under the Bosphorus and for mutual displacement, in case there is no water on the Anatolian Side, we pump it from the European Side, if it happens on the European Side, we pump it from the Anatolian Side to the European Side so that Istanbul is thirsty. Let it not remain and we achieved this.
But now sometimes they say, this is Izmir, Izmir was thirsty, we brought water to Izmir, we didn't care because this place is CHP. It is not our duty, it is the duty of the Metropolitan Municipality. We built the Gördes Dam and brought water to Izmir.
Look, right now the Gulf of Izmir smells exactly like our Golden Horn. You know how the Golden Horn smells. I am a child of this neighborhood. But we cleaned this Golden Horn, made it like this, now there are fish in this Golden Horn.
And we talked to everyone in this Golden Horn, the teachers and so on, do you know what they told us? If we turn the estuary into land by filling it, this will be solved, otherwise it will not be solved. So why should we turn this place into land? We met with many contractor companies, and also with international professors who have experience in this field, and they said, ""We can solve it."" I will not mention the name of the company, that company already knows itself very well and pumps this sludge from here to a quarry in Alibeyköy, 9.5 kilometers away from here, just like the oil lines, imagine a strainer there. We poured it there, and we took the mud from there and transported it to different places. Now it has become a 650 thousand square meter playground; look from where to where. But the Golden Horn has also become like this. And in order to make this Golden Horn work permanently, we connected clean water from the Bosphorus to here in the same way. By connecting clean water from the Bosphorus to here, the Golden Horn has now become a clean water with circulation and fish can now be caught easily.
And we didn't stop there, of course. Our ancestor, the Conqueror, manages the ships by land, but can his grandchildren remain in peace? We didn't stop either, what did we do? We built Marmaray under the Bosphorus on October 29, 2013, and since Marmaray was built, 350 million people have passed through there. Where is this? Marmaray, rail system from Asia to Europe. We said, it's not enough, what should we do? Oh, and we also built the Eurasia Tunnel, again the Eurasia Tunnel, as you know, under the sea, it is the Asia-Europe connection, and it is currently in service.
We said it wasn't enough, God bless those who built the Martyrs Bridge, Fatih Sultan Bridge, and we built the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, thus three necklaces were built on the Bosphorus.
We decided to take further steps in transportation. Remember, when we took office in 1994, were there intersections, diving-exiting, underground-surface, such things back then? Did not have. We came and started doing these things. And thank God, there have been nearly 100 such underpasses and overpasses in Istanbul since then.
In addition, for example, we brought the metrobus event, it is cheap in terms of cost, mass production and motrobus from Söğütlüçeşme to Beylikdüzü. It's right in front of your eyes, it's impossible to see this. What do you say you have done in 25 years? Here's the metrobus, it's there too.
And we also built light rail systems, and they continue. It's not over yet, I hope this rail system will also go to the Airport, the work continues. We did not stop there, for example, there is currently a rail system from Üsküdar to Çekmeköy, and it is in the form of a metro, which is currently in service.
With all this, these are the ones that come to my mind right now, because we have done a lot for Istanbul, but there are many more things we can do. Hopefully, we will build a three-storey tube under the Bosphorus in the same way, both cars will pass through there and we will connect Asia to Europe by using the rail system.
All this, you look at the metropolitan elections on one side, Binali Bey, and on the other side, he was the Mayor of Beylikdüzü, and CHP's candidate is now. Can this person be compared to Binali Yıldırım Bey? Mr. Binali started working as İDO General Manager together with me. I became Prime Minister, he came to Ankara with me as a member of parliament and I gave him the post of Minister of Transport and he continued as Minister of Transport.
My brothers,
Friends; Let's think carefully about this: In this country, where 6 thousand 100 kilometers of divided roads were built in 79 years throughout the history of the Republic, we, and this is very interesting, added 17 thousand kilometers of divided roads in 17 years, and thanks to Binali Yıldırım Bey, who managed this. We acquired 25 airports, there are 56 airports now, again, I was the Prime Minister, but my Minister of Transport was Binali Bey. And now, wherever you go in my country, you leave your home and go to the airport within half an hour or 45 minutes. Who would have thought that an airport would be built in Hakkari? They are deceiving my Kurdish brothers with false statements. Weren't we the ones who brought the airport to Hakkari? Weren't we the ones who brought the airport to Iğdır and Kars? Weren't we the ones who brought the airport to Ağrı? Well, we brought these. Why? Well, we are not discriminatory. We loved Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Bosnians, Roma, whoever they are, because of the Creator, and we provided this service to all of them. And we promised, we said that whatever is in the west will be in the east, whatever is in the north will be in the south, and we did these and this service will continue as it is, we cannot stop, it does not suit us to stop.
And I recommend that those who do not go to the Southeast, please go to the Southeast, those houses they destroyed, those ditches they dug... You know who dug it, the terrorist organization PKK and you know which party is its political representative right now, and these are the lands of my beloved homeland. They poisoned the right to life of those people by digging holes and opening tunnels under the houses there. So, what did we do? We built houses from scratch everywhere with the appointment of trustees. You can't recognize Diyarbakır right now, you see, there are 3 round trips and 3 round trips, plus pedestrian trips etc., we have built such a city that sparkles at night. When you enter Suriçi, Suriçi is also completely different. Historical castle etc., we have covered them. Likewise, we built picnic areas on the banks of the Tigris River, where you can both watch the Tigris and have a family picnic there. Why? Even if he is a Kurd, he is my brother and he is a human being, and it is my duty to serve him, because we came to this nation not to be masters, but to be servants. Therefore, this is what it takes to be a servant. We have taken these steps and we continue to do so.
As you know, a suspicious situation emerged in the metropolitan elections, where the number of consolidation minutes was 30 thousand, and the illegal ballot box committee chairmen were 212 thousand. As it is known, the difference between the two candidates decreased from 29 thousand to 13 thousand. In the face of this situation, the Supreme Electoral Board decided to renew the elections. Election renewal is not limited to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality; similar decisions were made in many other districts and towns. On Sunday, the people of Istanbul will elect the Metropolitan Mayor who will govern them for the next 5 years. As academics, businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders of this country, you know very well who has the real preparation, project and experience to govern Istanbul. The candidate who can properly carry the responsibility of this city and the trust of Istanbulites is clear. At this point, I trust your foresight and foresight. I wholeheartedly believe that Istanbul will make the most appropriate decision, especially regarding its future.
My request from you is that if there are citizens around you who voted for CHP, HDP, Good Party, Saadet Party or others, you share your opinions about the future of Istanbul with them.
Like many of my friends here, we have not forgotten the conditions under which we took over Istanbul in 1994 and the difficulties we brought to this day, but the young generation does not know these, but you know them as their fathers, uncles and uncles. Everyone who knows this person closely, or at least has detected the inconsistencies in his words, knows that the CHP candidate is a much more backward, more unprincipled, and much more incompetent model of the mentality we adopted in 1994. As President, we have nothing to do with individuals. Our entire struggle is to ensure that this city of Istanbul does not suffer a similar disaster again.
Remember, the CHP Metropolitan Municipality Mayor before 1994 and the CHP Mayor in Ümraniye again, the Ümraniye garbage dump exploded and 39 people died there. But we turned that garbage dump into sports facilities after we took office; This is our difference.
All our efforts are to ensure that this city, the apple of the world's eye, continues its journey in safe and competent hands. I hope that June 23 will be beneficial at this point.
I call on my fellow citizens of Istanbul to protect their democratic rights by going to the polls. Currently, with the intense work of our organizations from different provinces, we are bringing our citizens from Istanbul to Istanbul by buses etc.
And with these feelings, I once again offer my love and respect to all of you. I would like to thank Mr. Eray once again for this nice meeting.

Their Speech at the Bahçelievler Mass Opening Ceremony,2019-06-20,"

Beautiful People of Saint Istanbul,
My Brothers from Bahçelievler;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I send my love and respect to my brothers and sisters in all neighborhoods, districts, streets and households of Bahçelievler.
We last met with you, hugged and made up for our longings, just one day before the March 31 elections. Bahçelievler showed that it did not leave us alone by deeming my brother Hakan Bahadır worthy of the post of District Mayor with 50 percent of the votes in the March 31 elections. Hopefully, we will work day and night together to raise Bahçelievler to higher levels in line with our dreams and goals.
I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your support, love, covenant keeping and appreciation.
I hope that the 13 different works and services that we will inaugurate here today, with a total investment amount of 339 trillion liras, will be beneficial to our district and city.
Today, we are officially opening the Şirinevler Minibus Terminal and parking lot, metrobus pedestrian overpass, State Hospital multi-storey car park, Merkez Mahallesi Youth Center, Saklıvadi Sports Facility, family counseling center, psychotherapy center and other works that our Metropolitan Municipality brought to our district.
Today, we are holding the official opening of the congress center, Siyavuşpaşa sports complex and car park, square car park, nation's garden and other works, which were completed by Bahçelievler Municipality and are truly a very important work.
Dear brothers and sisters,
In the last 15 years, our Metropolitan Municipality has invested 1.5 quadrillion lira in our Bahçelievler district. Our brother Binali Yıldırım has very important preparations regarding the investments and services he will make in Bahçelievler, along with our other districts, in the coming period. Hopefully, we will open these together.
I congratulate our institutions, our Metropolitan Municipality and our District Municipality for providing all these services to our district.
My brothers; As you know, there is a renewal election for the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality on Sunday. In this election, the people of Istanbul will decide on one of two candidates. On the one hand, the Nation Alliance supported by the mentality of terrorist organizations... Doesn't it say so? What does Kandil say? Our votes are for the candidate of the Nation Alliance. It is clear who the candidate of the Nation Alliance is, I will not name names, there is no need. But we know that; Currently, CHP Chairman Mr. Kemal is disturbed by some things and cannot go out to the squares. Because their candidates avoid even mentioning the name of the Chairman. And all of these are lies, from top to bottom. Just as their Chairman lies, their candidates are also liars. And these, my dear brothers, also play all kinds of games beyond lies. When they are going to appear on a television program with Mr. Yıldırım, they meet with the moderator at the Marmara Etap Hotel before the television program, take the questions from him, make their preparations with these questions and appear on the program that night. And we have their documents. And right next to where he is sitting, my brothers, there are boxes, and you see those cardboards inside those boxes. A question comes up and a card is immediately taken out. We have their pictures, all recorded. But what does it say? I did no such thing. What happened then? They had to accept it, they had to. The liar's candle burns until nightfall. These did not burn even until Isha, and went out quickly. But are we ready to extinguish this candle completely on Sunday? So no stopping... No stopping...
My brothers,
Now I come to our candidate. Who is Binali Yıldırım? We wanted to enter the elections with a mayoral candidate who started his service journey in Istanbul with the Minister of Transport, my IDO General Manager, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Parliament, and all of them, and now he is worthy of our Istanbul. And we said to Binali Bey; Let's leave the Presidency of the Assembly and hopefully make you a candidate for mayor of Istanbul.
Of course, there is the CHP candidate on the other side. Who is this candidate? If we tell what this candidate has done, it will be better understood who he is. He accuses the Metropolitan administration by talking about the Court of Accounts reports at every opportunity. No public harm was detected in any of the issues included in the 2016 financial audit reports of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, therefore it is not subject to prosecution. However, 11 transactions that caused public harm were detected regarding the activities of this person only in 2016 during his term as Beylikdüzü Mayor. By whom? by the Court of Accounts. We have these documents, but he could not produce such a document. At the end of the trial, it was decided to compensate him for these damages. Therefore, this candidate's record is corrupt as determined by the Court of Accounts reports.
So, what else has this candidate done? He also denied the fact that the gap was constantly decreasing, which he himself stated on the election night; Here's another lie. He denied that they opposed or prevented the AK Party's application for a recount of all votes. Brothers and sisters, what was the difference? 29 Where did he land? There is a difference of 16 points to 13. Did he deny these? So, where are they? They stole and stole. What does this person say now? He says who stole it? You're not going to ask us this, you're going to ask yourself this. The perpetrator is obvious. How did it go from 29 points to 13 points?
Look, there are two languages ​​here, one is the legal language, the other is the political language. In political language this is called stealing, in legal language it is corruption, irregularity, this is what you did. And now we said, look, 10 ballot boxes have been counted, this is the table. If all of them had been counted, then we would not have held an election on this Sunday, we would not be faced with such a situation. But they ignored the intentional combining errors that are clearly visible in the minutes in their possession, almost all of which are against Binali Yıldırım.
My brothers,
See, when the ballot boxes are counted, the signatures are made after the counting is done, but here, the signatures were taken when they arrived there in the morning, and after the counting in the evening, the chairman of the ballot box committee filled them in as he wished. Now are we ready to spoil this game on Sunday? Are we ready? So, are we ready to teach these thieves of national will the necessary lesson?
They were not satisfied with this, he went and signed the Anıtkabir book saying ""I am the mayor"" even before he received his certificate of certificate, that is, even though he was not the mayor. What kind of a job is this, what kind of ambition is this? And the certificate given by the Istanbul Provincial Election Board is not the final certificate. Where is the final certificate? It is the certificate issued by the Supreme Electoral Council. I have experienced these, I know them well. So what happened now? Did the Supreme Electoral Council cancel this certificate of election? Now, what are we doing for him? We are going to the election. What happened to Anıtkabir with this signature? Anıtkabir management took that leaf away; Take another lesson. Why? The liar's candle burns until nightfall. This person is exactly what they call someone who uses a title he does not have.
What does he do next? As soon as they enter the municipality's doors, they bring in people from outside and try to copy the municipality's data, contrary to the law and all procedures. 3 people bring the data from outside, not the municipality's staff, and copy the data. After that, he says, what will happen, these things will be done; very brash. And my dear brothers and sisters, they know very well what these data thieves are called, both in the legal literature and in politics. However, municipal data is always backed up in two different places as a technical necessity. So, his concern is not to protect the data, but to take them and serve them somewhere. Do you know what method this is? This is the FETO method, FETO. So these would always steal data. With what? They did the same thing here with their members of the judiciary. Fortunately, this attempt was blocked by a court decision.
What else is he doing? While he is in Ankara, he signs documents in Istanbul. However, when a mayor is out of town, the person representing him is authorized to sign.
My brothers,
What is one of the segments this person targets? Non-governmental organizations. Supposedly, 100 million lira of money was transferred to these organizations from the municipal budget, and they did not make any cash payments other than carrying out joint projects with such organizations, which all carry out work for women, youth, children, disabled people, serve education, health, culture, sports, and do charitable works. There is no money transfer. In other words, this person is trying to destroy the bridges of Istanbulites' hearts.
What else is he doing? I just told you about the television program in which the two candidates will participate together. They lock themselves in the same room with the moderator and do their work there. So, what does it say? One says we met for 2-3 minutes, the other says we met for 5-10 minutes, the other says we met for 10-15 minutes. However, we determined that the duration of the interview was 45 minutes, they stayed in the same room together, that is, they stole the questions. I'm telling you, it's a lie, always a lie. Moreover, not only that, he can tell the lie that Binali Bey asked the questions in the television program he appeared on, without blushing.
Else, he goes to Ordu during the holidays and when he is prevented from passing through the VIP gate, which he wants to use even though he has no right to do so, he insults the governor of the state, in other words, he acts as an executioner of dignity.
My brothers,
Governors are the representatives of the President in that province. Insulting the Governor is insulting the Presidency. I go further, it is an insult to the nation. You can't just stand up and call a governor ""dog"". He saw that this was going to be difficult, what did he do this time? He said, I didn't say ""it"". What did you say? I said, he says, “simplification”, he maneuvered like this. Are these all in the television recordings? There is. Is there media, print media? There is. Do you think this nation is a sucker? Here's all that came to light. I am now calling out to my brothers who are devoted to the Republican People's Party, can such a man be appointed as the head of Istanbul? I call out to the supporters of the Good Party, can such a man be appointed as the head of Istanbul? I call out to those who are devoted to HDP, can such a man become the president of Istanbul? I call out to my Saadet Party brothers and sisters, can such a man be appointed as the head of Istanbul? It would be a shame for Istanbul. Moreover, the municipality's council is overwhelmingly from the AK Party, and all of the commissions are from the AK Party. All of the vice presidents are from the AK Party.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Even if this is just chosen as window dressing, it is enough window dressing that he will be the mayor. What will he rule with? Who will stand against him if he makes the slightest mistake? Parliament will be erected. Now he says, those who will not employ me have already started talking. So, he knows that he won't act properly. And AK Party municipal council members know that they will not give way to those who do not act properly.
My brothers,
Whatever you ask about what he did and said, he denies it. He's always in the ""I didn't see, I didn't hear, I didn't say"" mode. There are also things like “I enjoy it”. “I enjoy this, I enjoy that” I hope your enjoyment increases. It will increase even more after Sunday. To put it like in the late Ahmet Kaya's song, it is inconsistency no matter how you look at it.
Can the management of Istanbul be entrusted to a CHP candidate who is so unaware of what he does and what is happening around him? Can the future of this ancient city be handed over to those who say that the oppression started in 1453 and those who still want to take revenge for 1453 in the back of their minds? Can a city as valuable as Istanbul be left in the hands of such a political approach? The Chairman of the CHP is not there, the provincial president who insulted the faith of the nation is not there.
You know what the Istanbul Provincial Mayor is busy with? DHKP-C is the representative of a complete terrorist organization. In addition, he is very good with pigs, which is another feature of his. My brothers, their managers are not there, and even the candidate is not there. Now he won't go to the streets anymore. The CHP candidate, who plays the role assigned to him, constantly falters, but no one speaks up. Because they know that if those in the background step into the field, their true colors will be revealed. Calls to support this party's candidate either come from Qandil or from somewhere outside. What did they say about me? I am saying this CHP mentality, now they are perverting it too; They said, ""Erdogan's fate will be like Morsi's,"" you remember? Now that Morsi has passed away, these CHP members started tweeting. What did they say in their tweets? Erdoğan said, ""Your fate will be like Morsi."" Now I am calling out to this CHP mentality, you crooked mentality, wrong mentality, let them know this: We started this path wearing our shrouds and we are determined to walk this path by embracing God's will wherever, however and whenever it is.
And Morsi's death is a blessed death, a happy death. While he was dying in the courtroom for 25 minutes, this cruel Egyptian administration and the judicial institutions and boards there did not call a doctor or this or that, they waited there for his death. Now I am calling out from here, I am calling out to the Egyptian administration, I am calling out to the Egyptian judicial authorities; Long live Hell for the oppressors.
My brothers,
We elect the Metropolitan Mayor who will govern Istanbul. When we go to the ballot box, our measurement is; It should be who will manage this city better with his projects, experience, talent and team. From here, I call out again to my citizens who have devoted their hearts to CHP, HDP, İyi Party, Saadet Party; Istanbul is not a city whose future can be put at risk or its achievements can be jeopardized for any reason. We must all protect Istanbul together. We should hand over the management of the city to whichever of the Metropolitan Municipality mayoral candidates can overcome Istanbul's transportation problems, urban transformation works, greenery, landscaping and social services. I believe that we should go to the polls on June 23 with this sense of responsibility, not only for our own future but especially for the future of our children.
Now I expect such an answer from you that all 39 districts will hear this. Are you ready?
O Istanbul, do you support the national will, democracy and the ballot box on June 23?
O Istanbul, will you protect the future of our city and our children on June 23?
Hey Istanbul, do you surrender the management of the Metropolitan Municipality to experience, knowledge and sincerity on June 23?
Istanbul, do you say Binali Yıldırım on June 23? God willing, I hope this will be finished on Sunday, God willing.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
The greatest proof of our love, affection and value for Istanbul is that we nominate one of the best project developers of our country as a candidate for this city. If you pay attention, whenever our brother Binali Yıldırım says project, investment, service, the other party immediately diverts the matter to another side with words.
When I saw these, I remembered 1994. At that time, when I aspired to govern Istanbul, the other candidates we competed with were busy with their political fights, not their projects and service commitments. We were the only candidate whose heart ached for Istanbul, who wanted to do something, and who had a project to solve the problems. This city made us Mayor not because it was infatuated with our karakaş or karagöz, but with the belief that we would provide it with the best service. Shortly after taking office, we changed the face of Istanbul in every aspect, from garbage to cleaning, from drinking water to sewage infrastructure, from natural gas to transportation, from social assistance to sports facilities. We continued to be closely interested in every issue of Istanbul during our Prime Ministry and Presidency.
Today, in the election debates, those who support the CHP candidate talk about everything, without considering whether it is right or wrong, except what service they will do to Istanbul. 25 years have passed, but their minds have not changed at all. They still look down on the nation, they still disregard the nation, they still think they can run a cheese ship with words, they still believe they can overlook the truth from where they sit, or more frankly, they still think they can deceive the nation.
We have endless respect for every choice. Our effort and concern stem from the fact that we dream of a better future for Istanbul and our country. We all saw together how Izmir, one of the most beautiful cities of Turkey, was wasted in the hands of this mentality. Izmir was thirsty, we brought water to Izmir, we brought water to Izmir from Gördes Dam. Why didn't they? Just like Istanbul was thirsty too, right? Of course, young people do not remember this, but people aged 30 and 40 do. Were we carrying water? Were we filling the bathtubs? Water stations were established in Istanbul to carry water in canisters. This brother of yours brought water from the Istranca Mountains to Istanbul, 140 kilometers, we pierced the mountains. We brought water to Ömerli from Melen on the Anatolian Side in the same way. We said, it wasn't enough, we created tube passages under the Bosphorus, and from there we transferred water from Anatolia to Europe, and from Europe to Anatolia. Why? We did these so that the people of Istanbul would not go thirsty. My brothers; Their minds and minds cannot comprehend these things.
It's not over, did we remove the mountains of garbage? There was a CHP administration in charge, the garbage dump in Ümraniye exploded, as you know, and 39 of our citizens died there. Who was in the municipality? Again CHP. But we solved it, it is now sports facilities, we solved these.
Was Istanbul's air polluted? Remember, what did the newspapers distribute? He was distributing masks. And 50 thousand houses had natural gas, do you know what we did with it? While I was going to prison, we brought natural gas to 1 million 250 thousand homes and cleaned the air in Istanbul. Now 6.5 million homes have natural gas. Who did this? We did it, not CHP, AK Party did it.
It's not over, Golden Horn, you know the Golden Horn, how did the Golden Horn smell? We have made that Golden Horn clean now. And you know, there was Sütlüce Slaughterhouse next to it, what did we do there? Now we have built the Haliç Congress Center; Look from where to where, we did these. And we carried the mud we extracted from the Golden Horn to the Alibeyköy quarries, 9.5 kilometers away; this is us.
And now metrobuses pass through here, right? Where does it come from? From Söğütlüçeşme. Where is it going? He goes to Beylikdüzü, where the CHP candidate is. Who did these again? We did it. And now we're building light rail? We do that too.
My brothers,
It's not over, have we built Marmaray under the Bosphorus? And did we open it on October 29, 2013? Do you know how many people have passed through Marmaray since then? 350 million. Let me see those who use their hands like this. Mashallah mashallah. Here we do, they talk.
Have you ever used the Eurasia Tunnel? Who did it? We did it. My ancestor, Fatih, sailed ships by land. We also conduct it under the sea; this is it.
And we built the third bridge, the first bridge, the second bridge, and the third, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge. What did we do with heavy vehicles? We took it there, we did it again.
Now I come to the most important one, Istanbul Airport; Thank God, it is currently among the top three in the world. Germany's Berlin Airport has not been built for 17 years, but we built it in 5 years. Did you see it, did you like it? This is our difference.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
With all this, we are now turning Atatürk Airport into a public garden and building an exhibition center next to it. On the other side, we are creating a small airport where heads of state come and land. And hopefully, our 25 district municipalities will enrich our districts with their public gardens and public coffeehouses. But hopefully, we will take this much further under the leadership of Mr. Binali. Izmir could be in a much worse situation today. But as your brother who loves Istanbul, we are saddened by this situation of Izmir. The smell is overwhelming in the Gulf. Because Izmir is in the hands of CHP members. CHP means dirt, CHP means garbage, CHP means sewage. We have cleaning.
Now, how will we take our Istanbul further? I say that; Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Friday, Saturday, what's left? Three days, counting today. Are we ready to go door to door? Are we ready to warn all our citizens by phone or by seeing them in person? And hopefully, are we ready to bring my brother Binali Yıldırım to the showcase of our Istanbul as the Metropolitan Mayor on Sunday evening? That's why we nominated our brother Binali Yıldırım to Istanbul. And the service caravan will move quickly, we will not compromise on this. But I believe in you, I believe in your Rabia. And they won't be able to divide us, they won't be able to tear us apart. Because what do we say?
One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state. We will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together. Oh no negligence.
Thank you, long live.

"Their Speech at the ""Istanbul, Together We Are Turkey"" Meeting",2019-06-19,"

Dear Istanbulites,
Dear Guests,
Dear Opinion Leaders of Our Neighborhoods,
Ladies,
Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I would like to thank each and every one of you for attending our meeting. I would like to express my gratitude to the valuable managers of our Fikr-i Asım Association, who made it possible for us to meet under the same roof this evening with the slogan ""We are Turkey Together"", and to all our friends who contributed to our meeting.
I wish success to our Fikr-i Asım Association, which acts with the aim of raising patriots who are the guarantee of the spiritual and national unity of our country and bringing different segments of society together around common ideals.
First of all, I would like to express one thing here; As you know, a very unfair and ugly campaign has been carried out lately targeting our voluntary organizations. Our foundations and associations, which raise people, take care of our youth, support the education of our children with scholarships, dormitories, intellectual, academic, social and cultural studies, are being tried to be destroyed. The duty of a politician or an administrator is not to prevent good deeds, but to eliminate the bad, harmful and useless. The responsibility of a mayor is to help everyone who protects our national and moral values ​​without excluding anyone. Drying up the charity fountains that serve our people will only benefit terrorist organizations such as PKK, DAESH and DHKP-C. Declaring war on foundations and associations only benefits mankurt houses and drug barons like FETO.
Our voluntary organizations are the raiders of our cause for a brighter and stronger Turkey. The supporting pillars of our tradition today, as in history, are the foundations and associations that love the nation and the country. With this understanding, we have tried to stand by our volunteer organizations since our Metropolitan Municipality, without alienating anyone or making any discrimination. We have always supported these organizations in their activities for the benefit of our country and nation within the boundaries drawn by the law. We have especially tried to use the opportunities given to us by the nation in projects that will benefit our nation and contribute to our city and our people, and hopefully we will continue our way in this way.
Today, we will continue to support our beautiful unity here and our nation-loving organizations such as Fikr-i Asım Association, which is instrumental in this unity.
Dear Guests,
Today, there are soldiers of national will here who have strengthened the power of Turkish democracy with their work, efforts and achievements in their neighborhoods. Today, we have fellow citizens from different districts and districts of Istanbul. Today, we have brothers here from different political views, different origins, and different dispositions. Today, we have friends and brothers here who I can call the core of the great Turkish family of 82 million people. This hall is the essence and summary of not only Istanbul, but all of Turkey. This hall is the best example of our love and the bridge of brotherhood that we have built from the past to the present in Anatolia, which has been our homeland for a thousand years. Yes, we are Turkey together.
We founded this country together, we stopped the seven heifers together in Çanakkale. We made Anatolia a cemetery for the most powerful armies in the world. We carried our War of Independence to victory together. We are a family of 82 million people, including Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Arabs, Bosnians, Roma, Sunnis and Alevis. We are all children of the same climate, including Erzurum, Kahramanmaraş, Edirne, Trabzon, Rize, Samsun, İzmir and Diyarbakır. We are the children of a common belief, a common creed, a common history, who have built history and civilization together. We have been living under the same sky for centuries, sharing the same destiny, heading in the same direction every day, and keeping side together. We all feel the peace of the Azan of Muhammad adorning the skies of Istanbul five times a day in our hearts. We are all connected to this country, where a brave man lies in every inch of its land, not with dry words, but with faith, love and great passion. Our flag is clear, our call to prayer is clear, our nation is clear, our faith is clear.
No one can divide us, no one can build walls between our hearts, no one can cast a shadow on our eternal and eternal brotherhood, because we do not receive instructions from Kandil, we do not receive instructions from terrorists, therefore they will not be able to divide us. But if someone can walk on the road with Qandil, take a step with them and not say they have nothing to do with the PKK, we need to think about this. If he can't stay and say ""I have no connection with DHKP-C, I have no relationship with them"", let's put question marks here.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We are facing such a test this Sunday. We did not and will not tolerate surgery being performed on 780 thousand kilometers of homeland. We never allow discord to be brought between our cities and regions. Each of our 81 provinces and 82 million citizens is equally valuable in our eyes and deserves the same degree of respect and service. It is our commitment to these common values ​​that keeps us standing and gives us the strength to resist all kinds of attacks and all kinds of operations.
My brothers,
We derive our strength not from centers of tutelage, but from the unity and solidarity of our nation, as it is here today. We draw our strength from the brotherhood of Turks and Kurds, Arabs and Laz, Circassians and Bosnians, Tatars and Zazas, Roma and Albanians. What does our Lord say? We created you in tribes, we created you in tribes so that you could get to know each other better and understand each other. Notice there is no separation. But while we are talking about this, while we are thinking like this, unfortunately there are those who constantly provoke separation in our country, and we will not give them the opportunity.
We derive our strength from the solidarity of the Turkish nation, which has stood by us like a mountain with its prayers and support for 40 years. We derive our strength from the sincerity of the oppressed and victimized who break their sleep in the pitch black of the night and raise their hands to the sky. This is why we have been saying for 40 years that we love creation because of the Creator. That's why we see politics as a means of making hearts and making the palace of our people's hearts prosperous. This is why we are struggling to bring together every individual of the 82 million people on the common ground of Turkey. Our cause is the cause of unity, solidarity and brotherhood. Our policy is that if you do it wholeheartedly, you will win hearts. Thank God, we have never engaged in regional politics, identity politics, or exploitation politics, nor have we been among those who divided the map of Turkey into different colors or sowed the seeds of discord among our people. We have become a cause that is not confined to only certain provinces or coastal areas, but has received votes and strong support from all provinces of our country, from all segments of society, and this is how we have come to this day.
For the last 17 years, we have embraced and embraced all of our citizens, whether they voted for us or not. We said that whatever is in the north should be in the south, we said that whatever is in the west should be in the east, and we said that whatever opportunities these regions have, the 780 thousand square kilometers of our Turkey should have the same opportunities. Izmir is thirsty, we did not say let them be thirsty, we came and built the Gördes Dam, we gave water to Izmir. Likewise, we did not leave it alone because İZBAN is not working, Izmir Municipality cannot do it, we said to our Minister of Transport, Binali Bey, come and take over 50 percent of this place and let's complete İZBAN and put it into action, and we did it.
Please note that currently the journey between Istanbul and Izmir is reduced to 3.5 hours. We are doing that now and opening the Istanbul-Izmir road at the end of this year. Either we did these things, this cannot happen with this CHP mentality. We have love, we have problems.
Remember, remember Izmir Airport, what kind of airport was there in Izmir 25 years ago, we came and built the current Adnan Menderes Airport 17 years ago. Remember what it was like in those days. Türkiye was freed from the shackles that were placed on its feet during our period.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
During our period, our nation again gained the service and work policy it had longed for for years. In the last 17 years, our democracy has strengthened, tutelage has declined, and the unity and solidarity of our nation has been strengthened like never before.
My brothers; As the result of 17 years, I would like to clearly state a truth here. Today, the AK Party is the party of every segment of society and everyone in our country. We have always been the representative of both religious and secular people, young and old alike. Today, our movement, our cause is the only movement that can embrace 82 million people in all their colors, receiving votes and support from the east, west, north and south.
The People's Alliance and the AK Party are the guarantee of Turkey's internal peace, tranquility, stability and, most importantly, its national survival. But there are those who are uncomfortable with this concept of survival.
My brothers,
If the AK Party exists, if the People's Alliance is alive, if we can meet on minimum common ground, Turkey's future is bright, God willing. If we can come together when the issue is our homeland, our national survival and independence, the path and horizon of our country is open. Look, we are currently clearing all the red list, gray list, this list-this list terrorists. What did we say, what did we say? We said we would enter their lair. We said that until we ensure the peace of our people, we will continue this cleaning operation in Cudi, Gabar, Tendürek, and all the way to Kandil, regardless of mountain or stone. Here's what we started to do in Iraq with the latest Operation Claw, we started to clean them up. They will run away, we will chase. By the way, we have martyrs, it is true. But remember:
""To gush Martyrs land tighter the şüheda!
Let Huda take away my soul, my life, and all that I have,
""Don't let my only homeland make me miserable in the world.""
With Şüheda, these lands became a homeland, and from now on, with Şüheda, these lands will continue to be a homeland. That's why I hope flag, land, homeland, these are intertwined with each other.
“What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it.
If you died in pursuit of land it is the motherland.""
This nation's greatest strength is not its tanks, weapons or aircraft. The greatest strength of this nation is the unity, solidarity, and ancient brotherhood that has been kneaded with joy and sadness for a thousand years. As long as we embrace each other as 82 million people, there is no force that can destroy us or hinder our blessed journey. No obstacle can stand in the way of nations united around the same ideal and marching towards the same goal. I believe that it will be better understood if we put it in the concise words of our Independence Poet, the late Mehmet Akif:
“An enemy cannot enter a nation without division.
""As long as he hits the ball together, hearts cannot digest it.""
That's why, as the President of Turkey and as your brother who carries the trust of the nation on his back, I make this warning at every opportunity. Politics is never a zero-sum game. Politics is the art of bringing people together around common values ​​and common ideals. Politics is done not to divide but to unite, not to polarize but to bring hearts together. The key to both economic development and social development is unity politics. Whoever sees politics as a zero-sum game is doing it wrong. I say it openly to whoever uses politics as a tool to cause our people to fight against each other; He is betraying this nation. This nation will never forgive anyone who undermines the Turkish ship with 82 million people on board for their own benefit. Whoever turns the Parliament rostrum into a platform of slander is destroying not only his own reputation but also the reputation of politics. Whoever turns lies into a method of doing politics is undermining Turkish democracy.
My brothers,
A person who calls the governor of this nation ""a dog"" cannot become a politician, please know this. Then he said, “I didn't say dog, I said simplify”; And who are you going to deceive? Do you think this nation is a fool? Visual media detected this, print media detected this. And our Governor has insight and told me this: ""President, I think it would be right if I filed the lawsuit on the eve of the election."" I told him to be patient and file a lawsuit after the election, because anyone who would call the governor of this nation ""a dog"" cannot be a son of this nation anyway. And my dear brothers and sisters; Imagine, you will be the Mayor of a city like Istanbul, and on the other hand, you will use this expression to the governor of the nation. Do you know what the governor of this state means? It means the representative of the President in that province.
And forget that, here's what's interesting about the incident that was broadcast not on one television channel last night, but on all television channels: 2-3 days in advance, the person called the moderator draws this person, gives him all the information about what to ask, what to do, and so on. Appearing on a television program. Such information is not given to Mr. Yıldırım, it is given to this person. And he denies that too, but what happened? The place has ears, don't forget, and we now have the identification of which room at the Marmara Etap Hotel, how they met, how many minutes they met.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
This is immoral, this is immoral and this is immoral, such a thing cannot happen. Those who base political competition on immorality will lose sooner or later, hopefully on Sunday, with the foresight of my nation.
Turning political competition into a fight, and especially injecting hate speech into Turkish politics, does no one any good. Our country is a country that has paid a heavy price for such provocations in the past. We all know very well that the road leading to the 1960 coup was paved long ago with the events in Kayseri and Uşak. We remember very well how the junta members waited for the environment to mature before the September 12 coup, while they had the opportunity. We know very well how some strange people were introduced to the market before the February 28 intervention and how these people were constantly kept on the agenda by the media. Likewise, we all remember very well what the FETO scoundrels who infiltrated the state, from the Gezi incidents to the pit and ISIS terrorism, did to stir up the nation and how they turned a blind eye to terrorism.
At this point, we will all be very careful and will never allow anyone to escalate the atmosphere in our neighbourhoods, our surroundings, the apartments and districts we live in. We will protect our brotherhood, we will protect our democracy. We will protect the unity and solidarity of our people. We will protect this beloved homeland, watered with the blood of hennaed lambs.
We will protect our Rabia, the guarantee of our national survival, which we symbolize as one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state. My brothers; We will be united, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will all be Turkey and we will protect our homeland.
My brothers,
On June 23, as Istanbulites, we will once again go to the polls and elect the Metropolitan Mayor who will govern this beautiful city, entrusted to Fatih, for the next five years. I probably don't need to tell you what we did to Istanbul, you are the ones who know it best. And whatever we have done for Istanbul in 24-25 years, you should know that from now on, we will continue this at a much higher level, hopefully with our brother Binali Yıldırım, with his experience and dynamism.
I already hope that these elections will be beneficial for our country, our nation and our brothers and sisters in Istanbul.
Until today, we have not recognized any power above the national will. We protected the ballot box, which we saw as the honor of our democracy, at the expense of our lives. During the Gezi events and the coup in Egypt, CHP MPs said democracy is not just about the ballot box; As you know, the same statement is the statement of the PKK. PKK has never seen democracy as the ballot box. Now we need to show them on Sunday that this is all about the ballot box.
Last time, on the night of July 15, while some people were rushing to the ATMs, we, shoulder to shoulder with our people, protected Turkish democracy from the biggest, most treacherous attack in its history. Now you see that the cowards who escaped from the tanks on the night of July 15 are trying to give us and the nation a lesson in democracy.
What did those who applauded the coup in Egypt say? They said, ""Erdogan's fate will be worse than Morsi's."" My brothers; Know this well: We set out on this journey wearing our shroud. Those who did not speak out against the massacre in Adeviye Square are now making judgments from the podiums. However, we know their cemaziülevvels.
Look, the United Nations is now announcing its report on the Jamal Khashoggi incident, and the report states that the Saudis are definitely guilty of this, that they definitely had knowledge of this, and now the United Nations is announcing that their attitude towards Turkey is wrong. Now they will pay the price for this, they will pay the price.
And let me say this clearly: Mohammed Morsi's death is not a normal death, Mohammed Morsi's death is definitely suspicious and we will follow up on this.
We know very well how they tried to discredit the July 15 saga with the label of a controlled coup - that's what Mr. Kemal said, a controlled coup. We remember like it was yesterday how they took care of those who said ""the army is on duty"" at the Republic rallies, those who burned shopkeepers' shops during the Gezi events, and the separatists who set fire to the streets during the pit protests. It is of no value for those who did not protect democracy and national will in the most difficult times yesterday to talk about rights, law and justice today. In any case, neither we nor our beloved nation pay any attention to what they say. We leave them alone with their inconsistencies and embrace our struggle for democracy for our country and our future.
The irregularities, unlawfulness, and conspiracies against the national will that took place at the ballot box on the night of March 31 further strengthened our determination. By counting only the invalid votes, the difference between the two candidates decreased from 29 thousand to 13 thousand, and nearly 16 thousand votes were saved from usurpation.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Now the rival candidate says, who is the thief? Let me tell you friends, look, there are two types of these expressions. First, there are thieves, the theft of votes. Two, there are irregularities. Irregularity is a legal expression, but theft is a political expression. Now, if the votes drop from 29 thousand to 13 thousand, we will express this with something as politicians, we say, since these votes have decreased from here to here, it means 16 thousand votes have been stolen, we need to see this.
And ultimately what does he say? What did those who first said that they trusted and believed in the members of the Supreme Electoral Council say later? They said there was a gang in YSK; You didn't say that before. Well, when the Supreme Electoral Council announced the result, which did not suit them, they stated that this time the Supreme Electoral Council was made up of gangs, because for them, their interests are above all else. But God willing, the truth has been manifested, it will be manifested, but it will be thanks to you. If we work here successfully for 4 days, our Istanbul will get the administration it deserves.
My brothers,
Look, let's take it in these 24 years, from the buses you took in Istanbul, what kind of buses did you take? Icaruses are famous, could they be entered because of the smell? And I became the Mayor, I bought Mercedes' cars to Istanbul, because I thought it would suit my fellow citizens of Istanbul.
It's not over, you already know the Golden Horn very well, was the Golden Horn worth the smell? It was impassable and we turned the Golden Horn into its current state and fishing is now possible here.
The place where we are currently meeting, what was this place? This was the famous Sütlüce slaughterhouse. And as you know, right behind us, my dear brothers, there were offal sellers, was it possible to pass from here? It couldn't be passed. I am a child of this place, I was born and raised here, right here in Okmeydanı. And we laid the foundation during my term as Mayor and turned this place into a congress center, now look at this beauty. Since then, international and national congresses have been held here, and this is how we won them.
Let's skip that, we said about the Golden Horn right now, we are pumping water from the Bosphorus to the Golden Horn to ensure permanent cleanliness, so that there will be no problems here.
Istanbul is thirsty, we brought water from the Istranca Mountains to Istanbul, there will be no problem until 2040. We brought water from Melen to Ömerli in the same way, there is no problem anymore. We said, let's play it safe, we also built tubes under the Bosphorus, and if there is a problem on the European side, we will quench the thirst on both sides by pumping water from Asia, and if there is a problem in Asia, from Europe.
We removed the mountains of garbage, there are no mountains of garbage in Istanbul anymore, but remember the day when there were mountains of garbage. And much more interestingly, there was a garbage explosion in Ümraniye, the Metropolitan Mayor was a CHP member, the Ümraniye Mayor was a CHP member, it exploded and 39 of our citizens died there. Didn't the CHP mentality account for this? He gave up, and after that, he could not win the election in Ümraniye again, nor could he win the election in Istanbul. But now he should not win from now on either, because Istanbul cannot be handed over to them, it is very important.
And look, now the metro has been built from Üsküdar to Çekmeköy. Once we get on the metro, it goes from Üsküdar to Çekmeköy, and it doesn't have a driver, it goes by remote control, the most modern, most advanced technology. And from there it is now returning to Ataşehir. And we didn't stop there, we built the metro from Kadıköy to Kartal, Pendik in the same way, we didn't say there is CHP around here. Why? We said this would suit the beauty of Istanbul, we said we are in love with Istanbul. We brought the metrobus from Sögütlüçeşme to Beylikdüzü.
And there were no intersections, underpasses and overpasses in Istanbul before us. We came and equipped Istanbul with these underpasses and overpasses. And today I was in Sancaktepe, while passing through those underpasses, I said thank God, these are all our works. And much more importantly, alhamdulillah, we have now taken new steps to build Marmaray in Istanbul on October 29, 2013. And do you know how many passengers have passed through Marmaray since then? 350 million.
We said, we built the rail system, it suits us, let's also build a tunnel under the sea for cars to pass through, we built the Eurasia Tunnel, cars can pass through there.
We said, may God have mercy on those who built the first bridge and the second bridge, now we need a third bridge here, we built the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, we transferred more heavy vehicles there, and it was done. These are things that have been done, look, pay attention, I'm not talking about what will be done, I'm talking about what has been done. Now, hopefully, we will build another 3-storey line to the Bosphorus.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
These are the ones that come to my mind, of course. Alhamdulillah, we have done so much, so much. Now, of course, the most important thing is the airport we built in Istanbul. Look, the Germans have not been able to build an airport in Berlin for 17 years. We built this airport in 5 years. That's the difference, that's the difference.
Hopefully, we are now enjoying the public gardens. We are turning the old Atatürk Airport into a public garden. We turn the buildings next to it into a fair. We leave a small airport on the other side. And apart from this, I hope our district mayors continue to work intensively with public gardens and public cafeterias in their districts. Of course, stadiums, swimming pools, indoor sports halls, we are the ones who build them. We do, they talk.
The events that have occurred since the evening of March 31 have clearly revealed the difference in caliber, quality and character between my brother Binali Bey and the CHP candidate.
Mr. Binali was my General Manager at İDO, then he became my Member of Parliament and Minister of Transport, then he became Prime Minister, then he became the Speaker of the Parliament. He has national and international experience. I wonder what your opponent has, what experience he has? So, we need to think carefully about this issue here, and as a worthy mayor of Istanbul, we specifically selected and nominated a candidate with high caliber and qualifications.
It has been clearly seen whose concern is serving Istanbul and who acts as if stealing goods from a fire. The candidate polished by political engineers has been unmasked everywhere, from Anıtkabir to the scandal at Ordu Airport. Hopefully, on June 23, our nation will make the right decision and Anatolian wisdom will once again prevail over the politics of lies and slander.
Istanbul, which has been managed in safe hands for 25 years, will march to 2023 under the administration of a worthy president with his knowledge, sincerity, vision and state experience, hopefully under the management of my brother Binali Bey.
I believe that you, my brothers, who are the local serdars of the struggle for democracy, will make the right choice at this point.
I entrust my brother, Mr. Binali, to all of Istanbul before you.
On this occasion, I once again wish God's mercy to my brother Mohammed Morsi, the last elected President of Egypt. I express my condolences to his family, loved ones and all the Egyptian people.
I pray that God will always preserve our unity, solidarity and brotherhood. May God not allow Turkey, which is the hope of the oppressed and victimized, to stumble. May God make the June 23 elections beneficial for our democracy.
I thank each and every one of you and entrust you to God, stay safe and sound.

Their Speech at the Sancaktepe Mass Opening Ceremony,2019-06-19,"

Respected beautiful people of Sancaktepe,
Dear brothers and sisters,
Ladies,
Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Happy day, may our future be bright, may our Sunday be blessed.
I send my love and respect to my brothers and sisters in all neighborhoods, districts, streets and households of Sancaktepe.
We last met with you on March 5th and made up for our longing. Sancaktepe showed that it did not leave us alone by deeming Ms. Şeyma Döğücü worthy of the post of District Mayor with 50 percent of the votes in the 31 March elections. Ms. Şeyma was a sister of ours who was trained in our party's organization and was appointed to this position with the enthusiasm of serving Istanbul and our district. Together with our sister Şeyma, who had previously served as the Deputy Mayor of the Municipality, my sisters and I said, ""After İsmail Bey, a lady's hand should touch this place,"" and we started a new process here. You also deemed him worthy of the Mayorship with the highest vote rate ever. Hopefully, we will work day and night together to raise Sancaktepe to a level that meets our dreams and goals. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your support, love, covenant keeping and appreciation.
I hope that the 28 items of investment and services that we will inaugurate here today, the total amount of which reaches 276 trillion lira in the old figure, will be beneficial to our district and city.
Among the works we will be opening are a congress center, many schools, mansions built in our neighborhoods, information centers, sports fields, mosques, children's gardens and similar service units. Fatih recreation area, girls' dormitory, health center, traffic training area and disabled rehabilitation center are among the works we will open today.
My brothers,
In addition, 8 kilometers of stream improvement and 7.5 kilometers of side road arrangement, 64 kilometers of waste water lines, sacrifice area, and many municipal service units are among the works we will inaugurate. I congratulate our institutions, our Metropolitan Municipality and our District Municipality for providing all these services to our district. I would like to thank both our Metropolitan Municipality mayors, my brother İsmail and Ms. Şeyma on behalf of myself and my nation.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Let's go back in time, I would like to make an evaluation with you here. I would like to see how many people know about Sancaktpe 20 years ago. I'm talking about 20 years ago. Young people don't know this, do they? Because I believe that if young people knew this, they would vote differently. But when we go back 20 years, there is a fact: Was there such a Sancaktepe 20 years ago? I wonder if there was such a Sancaktepe with its infrastructure, superstructure, schools, hospitals, recreation areas, with its natural gas? Was there such a Sancaktepe with its water? Remember, weren't there mountains of garbage here too? But thank God, we came to power, Sancaktepe became a different district, we made it this way. And Sancaktepe literally rose from its ashes.
Now someone is out there and doing things in their own way. He says, what have you done in 25 years? The person who said this is the candidate opposite my brother Binali Yıldırım. It's as if the man didn't live in Istanbul, he doesn't know what happened anywhere in Istanbul. He learned after 2014 that they are still very new in this business.
My brothers,
AK Party is a party that has come to the agenda and hearts of our nation with projects, investments and services since the day it was founded. There will never be a place in our vocabulary for saying what you cannot do, especially for empty talk, especially for lying and slandering. When we came before you, we first told you about our works and actions. Then we asked for support by expressing our projects, preparations, and what we would do. Because this country and nation are fed up with empty talk, hypocrisy, pretending to be someone they are not, taqiyya, speaking differently to the public and doing other things behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Turkey has wasted precious years in the past because of this populist understanding of politics. The countries with which we started our development journey under similar conditions after the Second World War have surpassed us by leaps and bounds in the following years due to such skids. We were able to make significant leaps only during the late Menderes and late Özal periods. Both men were made to pay for their services through a chain of cruelty ranging from execution to all kinds of torture and insults. When we look at other countries, we see that they have become among the most developed countries in the world today, with a planned and determined journey. It was the AK Party that broke this vicious circle in our country, and we achieved this in 17 years.
Have we made this revolution in education?
Have we made this revolution in health?
Have we made this revolution in transportation?
Have we made this revolution in energy?
Are my citizens now free from air pollution?
Did he get rid of the mountains of garbage?
Here is Ümraniye, the garbage dump in Ümraniye, who was the Metropolitan Mayor then? CHP. Who was in Ümraniye? CHP. And when this place exploded, unfortunately 39 of our citizens died in Ümraniye. Either this is CHP, CHP is garbage, pit, mud. Know that those who come now will be no different. That's why we have four days until Sunday, are we ready to work hard? Are we ready to work 24 hours a day? We must knock on the doors of all our fellow citizens, one by one, and continue our journey with a different good news on Sunday, hopefully in the evening, okay? My sisters have a lot of work to do here. Gentlemen, you have a lot of work to do, look at the ladies, they look very fit.
For the first time in the history of the Republic, Turkey has experienced such a long and high growth period. Of course, this situation disturbed not only those outside but also some inside. This is why every attack we have been subjected to in the last 6 years has been passionately supported by certain groups within the country, especially the CHP and HDP. Those who were under the illusion that they would not be able to come to power by voting through the ballot box with the support of the national will, have come to rely on coups, crises, terrorist organizations and political engineering. These circles even went as far as the rematch of the conquest of Istanbul in 1453. What did they write on the walls? What did they write on the walls? They said the persecution started in 1453. Those who wrote this are CHP mentality. Now this CHP mentality will ask for our votes on Sunday. We are calling out to the CHP mentality; The oppression did not start in 1453, the conquest of hearts started in 1453. And to whom did Istanbul come after being freed from Constantinople, where there was oppression? Came to us.
And my dear brothers and sisters; Look, who were among those who were most happy with the outcome of the election on March 31? There were Greeks. You remember the headlines in Greek newspapers, right? Now, are we ready to reverse this this Sunday? So there is no stopping... We will strive hard, work hard, hopefully we will turn this around.
Now I come to another issue; Yes, remember the words spoken after the late Mohammed Morsi was overthrown by the coup and some of the messages given after his martyrdom. You feel ashamed for humanity, especially when you see the nastiness displayed on some social media accounts close to the opposition. Because what did this CHP mentality and its like have to do with me when Morsi was imprisoned? They were saying that Erdoğan's fate would be like his.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Will we say Sisi or Binali Yıldırım on Sunday? The issue is that important. Those who compare Erdogan's fate to Morsi's fate are the Sisi mentality; That's why we need to work hard. We are not afraid of these, we have already started this path wearing our shroud, and we will continue like this. That's why fear never suits those who set out on this path wearing our shroud.
Now, of course, I will make a special request to my sisters and brothers, we love each other for the sake of God, we will not hurt each other, we will never look at each other with evil eyes, right? Let's be careful about this, because we will love each other for God's sake, not for position or money, but only for God, and we will walk this path like this.
My brothers,
Mohammed Morsi, yes, unfortunately struggles on the floor in the courtroom for 20 minutes, and the authorities do not interfere with Morsi there. So I say that Morsi was not killed by natural causes, but was killed. For this reason, they were even afraid of the body of Morsi, who became Egypt's first democratically elected President with 52 percent of the votes, they did not give Mr. Morsi to his family, and unfortunately his wife was not among those who received Morsi.
And Morsi had a will to bury my body in my village, and they did not bury him in his village, the state buried Morsi in the place they determined, because they were afraid. My brothers; Cowards cannot build victory monuments, know this.
Of course, we, as Turkey, will follow the process regarding this and will do whatever is necessary to bring Egypt to trial in international courts. In addition, we also invite the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to take action. It is imperative that the Organization of Islamic Cooperation does what is necessary; No this, no that, no. We have the G-20 ahead of us, this will be one of the issues we will bring to the agenda at the G-20 meeting in Osaka. Because we will be on the side of the right and just, we cannot be on the side of the oppressors, we will be against them too. Hopefully, the G-20 Summit is important at this point.
I am calling out to the entire West, we observe that they have nothing to do with democracy or conscience. That's why we will not surrender our country and Istanbul to this fascist mentality, the enemy of the people, who never stop talking about democracy, on Sunday.
My brothers,
That's why we won't stop, we will run hard, we will fight hard. And know that there is only one mentality in these lands that does not discriminate between Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Bosnians, Albanians, whether eastern or western, northern or southern, and that is the AK Party mentality. Because we love the creation, we love you with the understanding of the Creator, we cannot discriminate between you.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
For this reason, we will hold on tightly to the national will, you will hold those who do not go to the ballot box and take them to the ballot box, and we will follow this closely. Hopefully, we will once again give those who insulted the ballot box the lesson they deserve, and for this reason, we will not leave the field to the thieves of the national will.
Now Mr. Binali Yıldırım's opponent says that they stole it. Yes, they stole, this statement is not a legal statement, this statement is a political statement. Because it is significant that, especially at the polls, people are brought in from somewhere to replace the civil servants, and even signatures on the minutes are taken in advance. When to get signature? The signature is taken after the count. But here we see that in many places, signatures are taken in advance and then they fill it in as they wish. In addition, 10 percent of the counting should be done; Why didn't you do it all? If you did it all, there wouldn't be an election this Sunday anyway. It didn't work.
Now, I want you to give such a voice that it will spread in waves to all districts of Istanbul, from there to our region and to the whole world. Are we ready?
Istanbul, are we supporting the national will, democracy and the ballot box on June 23?
Istanbul, do we protect the future of our city and our children on June 23?
Istanbul, on June 23, are we abandoning the ambitions of circles hostile to Turkey and the Turkish nation?
Istanbul, on June 23, do we surrender the management of the Metropolitan Municipality to experience, knowledge and sincerity?
Istanbul, do we say Binali Yıldırım on June 23? Mashallah, I hope this is over, are we ready for this?
My brothers,
The winner of the March 31 elections is undoubtedly the People's Alliance. The AK Party and the Nationalist Movement Party formed this alliance. As the AK Party, we emerged victorious in these elections with approximately 60 percent of the votes in the provincial general councils, 52 percent in the metropolitan municipalities and 55 percent in the provincial mayors. These results show that our nation is with us in our struggle.
As the People's Alliance, we took over 34 of the 39 districts of Istanbul, this is very important, right? Look, we took 25 of the 39 districts, among these 25, one belongs to the Nationalist Movement Party and 24 to the AK Party. 180 of the 312 Municipal Council Members are again from the People's Alliance. What does undisputed mean in this city? It means we have won. So, why are we going to the polls again on June 23? Because we detected deliberate manipulations and mistakes against the AK Party in the assembly minutes regarding the Metropolitan Municipality elections. Moreover, the total of these intentional mistakes reaches a figure of 30 thousand, a size that could change the election outcome. As you know, the difference between the two candidates started at 29 thousand, and with our objections and our ability to recount only 10 percent of the votes, it dropped to 13 thousand. So what's the name of this? The votes were stolen. Mind you, 16 thousand votes were only saved from being usurped by a recount of only 10 percent. This situation shows that the AK Party's votes were stolen, the votes given to the AK Party were internalized at the ballot box. This is a political statement, I have already said the legal one.
Someone insistently says, then who is the thief? We need to tell them this: The one who asks the question is the one who asks the question. This is a political statement. They already know this job well. Why? Who is responsible for this if not those who employ bank workers instead of civil servants? The person who transfers AK Party's votes to another party or evaporates them, who sets up this scheme and turns a blind eye, is a thief. Thieves are those who prevent the recount of votes by raiding the election board at night. Do we have to say it by name? Because the thief knows himself, he is constantly struggling and wondering what he is doing.
In addition, we found that some election boards were established illegally. The total number of votes in illegal election boards is 212 thousand. In this case, it is the renewal of choices required by reason, morality, conscience and, of course, law. Moreover, the decision to renew elections was not made only for Istanbul, but also in many other districts and towns on March 31. The reason we are going to the polls on Sunday is that simple.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
You, too, noticed that there was a strange situation before the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality re-election. I am speaking to you as your brother, who was the Mayor of Istanbul between 1994 and 1999, and I am speaking as your servant, not as your master. But look, the parties that make up the People's Alliance, the MHP, the AK Party, are on the field with all their assets, from their chairmen to their candidates, from their MPs to their organizations. On the other hand, the Chairman of the other party is not there, the executives are not there, the Provincial Chairman is not there. If you leave aside the media shows, the candidate is also missing. Support for the CHP candidate comes either from Kandil, from Selo, the imprisoned former Chairman of the party under Kandil's control, or from abroad.
What does Selo say? The votes are for the CHP candidate. What does Kandil say? The votes are for the CHP candidate. Look at this situation, what situation have we come to? Will my brothers who voted for CHP vote for those who act together with the terrorist organization? Will my brothers who voted for the İyi Party vote for the party and candidate supported by this terrorist organization? Will my brothers who support the Saadet Party go and vote for those who are hand in hand with this terrorist organization? A Muslim cannot and should not be stung through the same hole again.
Now, as you know, we were electing a mayor for Istanbul, what do terrorist organizations have to do with the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayor election? Why are all the circles abroad so interested in who will rule Istanbul? Do we care about who is elected mayor of London, Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam and Brussels? So the problem is different. The reason why the CHP Chairman, Provincial Chairman and other executives are not around is to prevent them from doing things that would damage the barely created image by showing their true faces. Their politics, like everything else, is fake. However, we are in the middle with our person, our candidate, our projects and everything.
If the issue is service, with God's permission, we will not recognize anyone other than our candidate Binali Yıldırım. If the subject is a project, we nominated Turkey's best project man for Istanbul. If it comes to doing business, who better to manage the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality than a person who has the support of the President and all ministries? If the issue is vision, it would be a great injustice to Binali Bey to compare the two candidates.
You followed the events before and after the program with the participation of the two candidates on television, right? You read it in the newspapers. The moderator and the CHP candidate come together at the Marmara Etap Hotel in Istanbul, where they discuss the questions, what questions he will ask and what answers he will give. Or did something like this happen? Could such a thing happen? What rudeness and immorality is this? You will act as a moderator, you will appear on a television program, and before this television program, you get up and give the questions to the CHP candidate. If you are fair and honest, what you should do is, then you get up, invite both candidates, invite the advisors of both, and talk to them about this. I had appeared on such a television program with Mr. Baykal in the past, but we have never faced anything like this.
Throughout this program, the CHP candidate told so many lies, from the Court of Accounts reports to the municipal services, that Mr. Binali was confused about which one to correct.
Did the Court of Accounts make its statement? He said there is no such thing, he said such a thing cannot happen. Remember, the CHP candidate also claimed before the television program that the questions were given to Mr. Binali, because this man lies a lot. Who did he come from? It came from Mr. Kemal. As much as there are lies in Mr. Kemal, this is now competing with his own Chairman. Of course, Binali Bey flatly denied that such a thing existed. It later turned out that before the program, the moderator and the CHP candidate met privately for 45 minutes in a hotel building. Although the CHP candidate stated that this meeting lasted 2-3 minutes, it was proven by the footage that they stayed in the same room for 45 minutes. So, what do we say about this situation now? The CHP candidate has so many inconsistencies such as I did-I didn't do, I said-I didn't say, I signed-I didn't sign, that we can no longer keep a tally. But this time, we are faced with a situation where people are openly lied to.
I wonder what the CHP candidate, who got involved in so many complicated matters while he was still a candidate, told so many lies, tried to deceive us, the whole of Istanbul, the whole nation, cursed and insulted everyone, would do when he sits in that seat tomorrow? I pray that God protects Istanbul from such a disaster.
What did this man say to our Ordu Governor? He said ""Push"", you remember that, right? After that it was a lie, what did he say? “I didn't say dog.” What did you say? You know those mentors who say, “I said simple, I said don't simplify.” Well, this was all over the visual media, all of them have the word ""it"" in them. It appeared in the media, it's there too. And right now, due to the election, the Governor has not filed his lawsuit yet, but after the election, the Governor will also file the lawsuit.
He insulted our police officers, and our police officers will file a lawsuit. Because we will condemn anyone who insults our police here and we will not allow him to do so either. There will also be a lawsuit regarding this.
From here, I call out to my citizens who are devoted to CHP, HDP, İyi Parti and to everyone who supports this candidate, mayor and politics, above all, require morality, accuracy, consistency, respect, love, this person has the qualities I mentioned. There is none.
My brothers,
He is literally making fun of all Istanbulites and all of Turkey with the lies he tells and the schemes he devises.
I repeat once again, if the issue is to elect a Metropolitan Mayor for Istanbul, the will of our nation is above our heads, regardless of its direction. But if the aim is to take over Istanbul and corner Turkey through Sunday's election, they will not be able to achieve this, and above all, the people of Istanbul will not allow it.
My brothers,
Now, ingenuity is subject to compliments, I am just saying the following: In my Mayorship, of course, the 20-year-old and 30-year-old group do not know this, tell the young people about this. Was Istanbul overflowing with mountains of garbage? Was there air pollution in Istanbul? And when I took office, natural gas was supplied to 50 thousand houses in Istanbul, and during my time in office, I brought natural gas to 1 million 250 thousand houses in 4.5 years, and thus we solved air pollution.
Was it possible to cross the Golden Horn because of the smell? It was impassable, we cleaned the Golden Horn. And is there a rail system from Üsküdar to Çekmeköy now? Came. And now, as you know, there is no such driver, he came there with a remote control, I hope it continues. Because we want it to come to Çekmeköy and Sultanbeyli. The President is already saying that it should come to Sancaktepe as well. Hopefully these will happen too. If it does these, AK Party will do it. Since they don't have trees planted, they can't do it.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Besides, there is something much more important and that is this: Look, they have made up something these days, saying, ""We are paying salaries to Syrians."" My brothers, we do not pay salaries to Syrians, all of these are lies from top to bottom. We only pay salaries to my poor citizens. Perhaps there are hundreds, thousands of people among us who are currently poor and poor, receiving salaries from strange and poor district governorships. We pay salaries to those who care for the disabled, the sick, and those who care for them at home, right? You already know these. We provide food, medicine, education, hospitals and such support to Syrians, especially those living in camps, not in the way they say, but CHP is always based on lies. Since it is based on lies, how can we slander it so that we can make profit from it, you will not be able to.
Another thing, we say this clearly: We are Ansar. They ran away from the bombs, they ran away from barrel bombs, they ran away from cluster bombs, they took shelter in us, and we took them under protection. We are Muslims, but we have nothing to say to those who have not received their share of Islam. Mr. Kemal says, ""I will send them to Syria"", the other one says, ""I will send them to Syria."" We send them as soon as we get the job done there. What have we done with 330 thousand Syrians so far? We sent it to Jarablus. We are sending and will send to places where the situation calms down.
Now I want a strong word from you again. O Istanbul, are you ready to bury those who want to use June 23 as a tool of their struggle against Turkey and the Turkish nation in the ballot box?
Hey Istanbul, are you ready to give a solid Ottoman slap at the ballot box to those who are dying to turn this city's mayoral election into a rematch of 1453?
Hey Istanbul, are you ready to give your answer at the ballot box to those who want to close Turkey in on itself while so many lives and vital problems are going on in the world and in our region?
Hey Istanbul, whatever the result on Sunday, are you ready to work with all your strength for one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state?
Are we ready to say with a loud voice that we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will all be Turkey together?
Are we ready to go door to door? May God bless you all.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Our love for Istanbul is not new. This is the place where we opened our eyes, grew up, received education, started life, entered politics, and first received the favor of our nation. We served this city, Istanbul, with the enthusiasm of worshiping in all our positions. We took a city whose roads were filled with mud and potholes, whose streets were infested with garbage, whose air was dirty, whose water was not running, and whose transportation was problematic, and turned it into one of the most important metropolises in the world.
We brought water here from Melen, saying ""water is civilization"". Likewise, we brought Terkos water from the Istranca Mountains. Do we have Marmaray under the Bosphorus? Have you boarded? Do we have Eurasia? Have you used? Look, do you know how many people have passed through Marmaray since October 29, 2013? 350 million people passed. We did this. Is the Yavuz Sultan Selim bridge here? If it does, the AK Party will do it, that's it.
Today, despite its population of more than 15 million, there is no water shortage anywhere in the city. The Golden Horn, which turned into a swamp, is clean. We purify the wastewater of the whole of Istanbul with the high-tech facilities we have established, and then discharge it into the sea. I just told you about natural gas, natural gas is supplied to 6.5 million homes. If it does, AK Party will do it. And we brought movement to transportation in Istanbul with the bus fleets we renewed and developed. Now, as we entered Sancaktepe, all the branches and branches, none of them were there. But thank God, these exist now. Istanbul's airport is currently number one in the world. They couldn't build an airport in Berlin for 17 years, but we did it. Hopefully, by 2024, we will make at least half of the transportation in Istanbul by rail system, which will greatly relieve traffic. I hope we are not left with these. We have put the groves, mansions, green areas and facilities that were once at the disposal of a handful of elites to the service of all of Istanbul.
Now we will enrich these places even more with public gardens. We will make Istanbul a more enjoyable city to live in with the green corridors we will establish in 20 different points of the city and the green areas we will create along the coastline. We have come to this day by putting service after service, not just talk after word. We did what we said.
What does the CHP candidate say? He says he will give scholarships to young people. What will you give, what will you give? When I was Mayor, I was giving scholarships, CHP went to the Constitutional Court and had that scholarship banned and abolished; you need to know these. When I became Prime Minister, this time I stood up and addressed those who wanted loans and scholarships, and we paved the way for this for all university youth. At that time, they were receiving a scholarship of 45 liras from the state, but since then we have increased this to 450-500 liras. And the postgraduate fee is 750 lira, the doctorate is currently 1500 lira; We brought it here, there is no negative response to anyone. Whether he/she has the opportunity to get a scholarship or a loan, we provide it.
He says; I made the buses free; Go ahead, we've already done this. We already made it free for all retirees, day and evening, during my term as Mayor.
Also, as you know, intercity bridges and highways are free during holidays, right? It's free. Now this says, I added national holidays to this; I'm glad you did it. Well, we did these, we overcame them, we finished them. I hope we will do more.
My brothers,
We did not try to get out of the situation like some people by saying we tried and kept it during the election period and then couldn't do it. We are the ones who brought the water, now this person is showing off with the water.
We stand behind every promise our brother Binali Yıldırım made for Istanbul. Hopefully, as the Government and the President, we will provide the necessary support to our brother Binali Yıldırım. And hopefully, we will become much stronger by working hand in hand with all our provincial and district municipalities. There is already the AK Party in the Metropolitan Municipality Council, the AK Party is in all the commissions, the AK Party holds the Deputy Mayorships. With all this, I hope that the AK Party will have the signature of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality in every step to be taken.
Are we ready? So there is no stopping... We say keep going. We are walking towards our 2023 goals. This city is the locomotive of Turkey. Istanbul will move forward, Istanbul will accelerate, Istanbul will win, Istanbul will grow with its production, employment, trade, finance, design and technology so that Turkey can make progress accordingly.
With this understanding, we are fighting for the future of all of Turkey, together with Istanbul. When you go to the polls on June 23, I ask you to vote by thinking not only of your house, street, neighbourhood, district, city, but also your entire country. I say further with my brother Binali Yıldırım. Just as you handed over the management of the 25 districts of this city to the People's Alliance, I want you to hand over the Metropolitan Municipality to the experienced and productive hands of my brother Binali Yıldırım. We cannot hand over Istanbul to these liars and cheaters. Be assured that your trust will be safe. In our way, protecting the trust, especially the trust of the nation, is both the greatest responsibility and the greatest honor.
I would like to especially address my sisters from here; It is not enough just for you to vote, you must also ensure that everyone at home goes to the polls on Sunday and casts their vote correctly.
Our youth also have a great responsibility; On Sunday, you are responsible for both taking those around you to the polls and protecting the ballot box.
I cannot thank my Lord enough for giving me companions, companions, and fellow citizens like you. Hopefully, we will receive the reward of our efforts and prayers on Sunday by making our brother Binali Yıldırım the Metropolitan Mayor.
I thank each of you in advance for your efforts. I offer you my love and respect.
I wish you good health.

",2023-06-23,"Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayoral elections, which were canceled on June 23, were repeated. CHP candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu won the election, receiving 54.21 percent of the votes.",before
Their Speech at the Sultangazi Mass Opening Ceremony,2019-06-18,"

I send my love and respect to my brothers and sisters in all neighborhoods, districts, streets and households of Sultangazi.
We last met with you at an enthusiastic rally on March 30, just one day before the election. Sultangazi showed that you did not leave us alone by deeming our brother Abdurrahman Dursun worthy of the post of District Mayor with a vote rate of 59 percent in the March 31 elections. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your support, love, friendship and appreciation.
I hope that the 24 separate works and services that we will hold the mass opening ceremony here today, with a total investment cost of 1 billion 188 million liras, will be beneficial to our Istanbul and Sultangazi.
One of them, as you can see right now, is the Sultangazi Haseki Training and Research Hospital, which is right next to us and has an investment cost of 501 million liras, or 501 trillion liras in the old figure. This hospital; It is a truly modern hospital with 600 clinical beds, 120 intensive care beds, 67 emergency room beds, 144 outpatient clinics, emergency services, operating rooms and other units.
Some people talk, we do it; This is our difference. One of them says, very interestingly; He asks what have you done in 24 years. My brothers; Just look, this work is the best expression of this work. What if the current Sultangazi existed 24 years ago? What was this Sultangazi like? But we came and turned Sultangazi into a modern district from top to bottom with all its infrastructure, hospitals, schools, transportation, natural gas, everything. This was not a district when we came anyway, what did we do afterwards? We turned this place into a district.
Today, we are opening the many works that we have brought to our district, such as the urban transformation residences of our Metropolitan Municipality, indoor swimming pool and sports facilities, student dormitory, neighborhood service facilities, public garden, Metris Bridge Junction and side road, Habipler Fire Station. Answer to those who ask what you did. This is just Sultangazi, I'm not talking about Istanbul, I'm talking about Sultangazi.
My brothers,
We also hold the official opening of the Vocational School of Social Sciences and the Women's Center, completed by our Sultangazi Municipality, from here. Today, we are officially opening the youth center, youth and art center, police station and nine separate schools built by our ministries.
Now my sister has opened a small banner and says; “Dede Tayyip, with you we learned determination, work, honesty, dreaming and achieving.” Thanks. The longer you are with us, the more we will walk this honorable path.
I congratulate those who contributed to bringing all these works to our city and district. Anyway, this participation shows something today of the week, what is it? We are tired of transcendence; housing. We said that he who walks in love never gets tired, and we did not get tired. Hopefully, we will undertake much greater services and investments together in the whole of Istanbul and our district in the coming period.
Dear Brothers and Sisters;
First of all, I will share another issue with you here today, and that is this: I once again wish God's mercy to our brother Mohammed Morsi, the first elected President of the Egyptian people, who walked from captivity to martyrdom. And unfortunately, he was taken in on the same date, and on the same date, unfortunately, 6 years later, he was martyred in the courtroom in prison.
I express my condolences to the Egyptian people and the Islamic world. I regretfully condemn the Western world and all humanity for watching the late Morsi, who came to power through a democratic election, being overthrown by a coup, being tortured in a single room in prison, and finally losing his life.
The fact that those who reminded us of Morsi's end when he was overthrown by a coup are displaying the same ugliness today indicates that the dirty mentality in front of us still exists. We are currently competing with those who remind us of Morsi. Yes, yes, don't forget right now, in the election to be held on Sunday, on one side there are those who remind us of Morsi, and on the other side there are those who will walk this path with justice. That's why these five days, including today, are very important, don't stop, keep going, we will run hard, we will work hard and hopefully we will be honored with victory on Sunday evening.
And I say this: Long live hell for the oppressors. As you know, today, after the afternoon prayer, a funeral prayer will be performed in absentia for our late Martyr Morsi at the Fatih Mosque and we will arrive there. This will be done throughout Turkey with the announcement and call of our Presidency of Religious Affairs.
I believe that we will once again show the power of democracy, national will and the ballot box to those who still have not recognized Turkey and the Turkish nation despite July 15 and the events we have experienced all these years. Are we determined until Sunday? Are we ready for the manifestation of the national will at the ballot boxes? So, there is no stopping... And as the People's Alliance, the Nationalist Movement Party and the AK Party, we will hopefully achieve this, hand in hand.
And life in the path of serving God and His people, yes, look, he is either dying, and on the occasion of his death, they are even afraid of his deceased state, they do not bury his wife, they are burying her with her two sons at five this morning. Why are you afraid? Yes, you are afraid of such martyrs. Long live hell for those who are afraid.
And they will not be able to achieve this, nor will they be able to achieve this for our country. Just as they failed on July 15, they will not succeed from now on either.
My brothers,
Right now, there are tweets about July 15 that my brother Binali's rival sent at that time, and it is clear where he was in those tweets. Where? Together with FETO. But as you know, there are many lies in these. What do they say? I have nothing to do with them. Well, it's all on record.
Here in Ordu, he calls our Ordu Governor ""it"", then he says ""I didn't say push"", he says ""I said simple"", he says ""I said simplification"". It's all there on record. Be honest, honesty suits politics, not lies like the man in charge. Take one and hit the other. That's why we cannot surrender our Istanbul to these liars. So we will go door to door, our phones will not stop ringing, okay, are we ready for this?
My brothers,
There is no doubt that the winner of the March 31 elections in Turkey and in Istanbul is the People's Alliance, the AK Party. Our nation, do you know how many votes we received in the provincial councils across Turkey in these elections? 60 percent. Our nation stood by us and the People's Alliance with a rate of 52 percent in metropolitan mayors and 55 percent in provincial mayors.
25 of Istanbul's 39 districts were on our side, one of them was left to our MHP brother, 24 to our AK Party brothers, and 14 to the known Nation Alliance. There are 312 Municipal Council members in Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, 180 of these 312 were won by the People's Alliance. So, what is left for the Nation Alliance? The rest was left to them. My dear brothers and sisters, we are clearly ahead. All the deputy presidents are from the AK Party, this is the picture. So, first of all, since all the commissions in the management of Istanbul are currently in the People's Alliance, providing the service here in the most ideal way can only be done this way and not otherwise.
Now there was an uncertainty here, here are the obvious mistakes in the merger minutes to resolve that uncertainty. Now they are saying that the gentleman was disturbed, you know when they said ""they stole it"". Look, let me tell you from here, I am telling my brother Binali Yıldırım's opponent, the statement that they stole is not legal, but political. We politicians, if someone steals something, we say he stole it. What is legal? It's irregularity, okay. But besides irregularity, this also has a political expression, what is it? That is also corruption. So there is both corruption and theft here, let us say this, that is what we are saying.
AK Party is a party that derives its power from national will. Until today, we have always struggled to ensure that our nation's will is manifested in the healthiest way at the ballot box. It is our duty to hold accountable the corruption, theft and unlawfulness we detected in the Metropolitan elections on March 31. What did we do? That's why we went to the Supreme Electoral Council. “I got my certificate of registration,” he says. You did not get your certificate from the Supreme Election Board, you got it from the Provincial Election Board; You don't know these things yet, you will learn. What happened? We made our application, what did the Supreme Election Board do after the application? He canceled the certificate given by the Provincial Election Board and took it from you. Huh, what does this mean? You still have a lot to learn. We fell out of control like Nasreddin Hodja, we know all of these, and because we know this, we applied to the Supreme Electoral Board and what did the Supreme Electoral Board do? He decided to renew this election. Because there were many examples of this in the past and it was cancelled.
The decision to renew the elections is the product of a legal process, not a political one. The Supreme Election Board, which decided to renew the metropolitan city, did not find it necessary in two separate districts where similar objections were expressed. We did not shout and scream, we did not call the Supreme Electoral Council a gang. But while Mr. Kemal first praised the Supreme Electoral Council, he later called the Supreme Electoral Council a ""gang"". There is no such thing in our literature, but unfortunately they have it and they said everything.
We believe that the numbers subject to objection have not reached a level that would require a renewal of the election; on the other hand, there are more than 212 thousand votes in the ballot boxes in the Metropolitan Municipality where the consolidation minutes are missing or prepared without signature, and in the ballot boxes where 30 thousand ballot box committee members were appointed contrary to the law. It is significant that the difference between the two candidates decreased from 29 thousand to 13 thousand due to the objections of the AK Party. He denies this in his television program last night and says there is no such thing. Why? Or lies are ingrained in their genes. What is he saying? ""I did not call the Governor of Ordu a dog,"" he says. What did you say? “I said simplify.” It's in all the visual media, it's in the written media, you said it, you will answer for it after the election, wait, it's not over, you will pay. Not only that, he also called my police, my police officers, and his streetwalker called them ""dishonorable people"", they are also in the records; You will pay for them. We neither make our Governor call him ""dog"" nor our police call him ""dishonorable"". Aren't you ashamed? You take the police of this nation with you as bodyguards, and then you call my police ""dishonorable people"". We will hold them accountable. Everyone will know their place and their place.
My brothers,
It was possible to resolve this situation, which arose when only 10 percent of the votes were counted, by having all the ballot boxes counted again. The CHP administration objected to our request for the counting of all the ballot boxes and prevented this, and did not want it to be done. However, if he had accepted it and if these ballot boxes had been reopened and counted, it would not have come to this point today. Because we were confident in this matter, those in front of us probably chose to make things worse because they knew the outcome. Ultimately, the issue went to the Supreme Electoral Council, which is the final decision-making authority regarding the elections. Since the problematic figures determined by the Supreme Electoral Board were larger than the difference of 13 thousand, it became inevitable to renew this election as a requirement of law, morality and conscience.
I expect a very strong support from you for our candidate Binali Yıldırım in the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayoral renewal election to be held next Sunday.
Now, gentlemen and ladies; Make such a sound that even ears that cannot hear, hearts that are calloused, eyes that are closed, tongues that are muted will wake up. Are you ready?
Istanbul, do you support the national will, democracy and the ballot box on June 23?
Istanbul, will you protect the future of our city and your children on June 23?
Istanbul, do you surrender the management of the Metropolitan Municipality to experience, knowledge and sincerity on June 23?
Istanbul, are you once again abandoning the ambitions of circles hostile to Turkey and the Turkish nation on June 23?
Istanbul, do you say Binali Yıldırım on June 23?
May God bless you all.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Istanbul and Türkiye have known us and our team since 1994. But my Binali brother's opponent doesn't know any of this. Look, let me just say this: Was there such a thing as Marmaray in Istanbul? Did we? Do you know how many passengers passed through there? 350 million passengers passed through. Think, Marmaray under the Bosphorus. As you know, we opened it on October 29, 2013, and 350 million passengers have passed through it since then. Nobody knows. If it were up to CHP, they wouldn't have made us do it anyway. Thank God it is not visible, but we did it from under the sea and finished it.
Eurasia Tunnel, we did that too, are we finished? Does it also pass under the Bosphorus? Have we connected Asia to Europe? But if it were up to them, they would never allow it.
Have we built the third bridge? Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge. Do you know that this CHP mentality did not want him? But we said; We will do it there too, whether you want it or not, we will do it and we did it. Is that over?
Did we build the Osman Gazi Bridge? And did we connect Istanbul to Izmir? We are opening the route between Istanbul and Izmir at the end of this year. Well, we did these. I especially appeal to young people; Dear Young People, look, it is the AK Party government that made these investments, know these.
And the third airport will be number 1 among the top three in the world when it is completed. And now, thank God, we have become a good example to the world with our third airport. Berlin Airport was not completed in 17 years, but we completed Istanbul Airport in 5 years, this is our difference. Some people talk, AK Party does it. So. Whatever we said... That's it.
Now remember, what kind of Istanbul we took over in 1994, the young people here do not know this, because they were not there that day. But those who are 40 years old now and so on, they know, you know, right? Those who know, please raise your hands, there are a lot of them, thank God. You know very well where we brought the city from.
Youth,
Now always ask these questions to your elders. You are the ones who know what kind of Turkey we took over in November 2002 and where we brought our country to. We have done a lot for Istanbul and our country so far, there are still shortcomings, there were mistakes, but they could not do these. Was Istanbul full of mountains of garbage?
My brothers,
There was a CHP Mayor in Ümraniye, there was a CHP Mayor in Istanbul. Ümraniye garbage dump exploded, 39 of our citizens died there. Who is responsible? CHP. The Metropolitan Mayor is from CHP, the District Mayor is from CHP. And we came and eliminated these mountains of garbage. We equipped those places with sports facilities.
And my brothers; We brought natural gas to Istanbul. Do you know how much natural gas was used in Istanbul when I took office? 50 thousand houses had natural gas. When I left office, I brought natural gas to 1 million 250 thousand homes. Thank God, there are now nearly 6.5 million homes in Istanbul where natural gas is supplied. If it does, AK Party will do it. Thanks. And that's how we eliminated air pollution.
Now he says, I will make water cheaper like this. Which water will you make cheaper? Once we took the thirsty Istanbul, the thirsty Istanbul. This brother of yours brought water to Istanbul by drilling through the Istranca Mountains. We brought water from Melen to Istanbul in the same way. It wasn't enough, do you know what we did? If there is a problem in Europe, there will be a problem in Asia, if there is a problem in Asia, we said let's move from Europe. What did we do? We built a water tunnel under the Bosphorus. Of course, no one knows this. And in case of any problem, there is no discomfort anymore, we solve this problem by immediately shifting from one side to the other.
My brothers,
You see, we said we would raise Turkey on 4 foundation stones; We said education, we said health, we said justice, we said safety, did we do these? Are we doing it? Here, my Minister of Health is with me and we are intensively expanding city hospitals and these hospitals. And the doors of hospitals will never be closed to my citizens again. Remember those days when Mr. Kemal was the General Manager of SSK, our dead were held hostage in hospitals. Is there such a thing now? The doors are open, do you buy your medicine from the pharmacy of your choice? We came here. And now, with the decisions we have just taken, we are now providing our patients with medicines for many diseases, including cancer, is that correct, Mr. Minister? We came here. Because there is no object as respected among the people as the state, there is no state like a breath of health in the world; We are the ones doing this.
Every individual of this country will acknowledge the fact that whatever we did, we did it sincerely, we did it with good will, we did it to achieve better. We have never been among those who say one thing to the nation, act differently in front of the nation, and act differently when our back is turned. We openly expressed and showed both our love and discontent. We have never approved those who base their politics on bilingualism, hypocrisy and role-playing. What does Mevlana say: ""Either appear as you are, or be as you appear."" We took this as our guide.
My brothers,
We have never allowed discrimination among our nation. We did not say Turkish, Kurdish, Laz, Circassian, Georgian, Abkhaz, Albanian, Roma or Bosnian. We said we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together. My brothers, I love you because of the Creator, can there be anything more beautiful than this? Could there be anything greater than this? That's the thing. Loving the created thing because of the Creator, all the others are nonsense. That's not why we see each other as Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Roma, Bosnians, etc. What will we say? Well, God, who created me, also created you, that's why I love you. Not for office or position, not for money.
Okay, guys, we will work hard, okay? We will work hard. I love you too, okay. We will work hard, we will strive hard, we will go door to door.
Now he says, ""I will give this much money to the young people."" Either don't lie, don't lie. Here, I caught you in another lie. Once, during my term as Mayor, I was giving scholarships to university students. Do you know what CHP did this? He took it to the Constitutional Court. And this scholarship we gave to young people was banned by taking it to the Constitutional Court, the Constitutional Court at that time. Then, when we came to power, we started giving scholarships from the Prime Ministry. Skip this too, we said; Let's make this work more permanent and what are we doing now through the Credit and Dormitories Institution? We provide both loans and scholarships. Whoever wants can get a loan, whoever wants can get a scholarship. We don't turn anyone away empty-handed, that's who we are. Don't deceive the nation. And as a municipality, you currently do not have the authority to provide scholarships according to the law. CHP was the one who banned this, took it to the Constitutional Court and banned it. So what did we do with this? We solved it through the Credit and Dormitories Institution. Now, the Credit and Dormitories Institution provides loans to anyone who wants this job, and scholarships to those who want it. It does not turn anyone away from scholarships or loans, but gives them to anyone who wants them.
My brothers,
However, despite all the difficulties we have experienced, we have overcome these obstacles thanks to the strong bond we have established with our nation on the basis of friendship. Because our nation trusted us, they supported our fight against tutelage. Because our nation believed in us, it stood with us against the coup plotters with its blood and soul. Because our nation trusts us, we found the strength to challenge the seven world powers. Thanks to our nation's support, we destroyed the lairs of terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq.
Now they made up something else, what are they saying? Either you filled these places with Syrians, you don't give money to us, you give it to Syrians. Brothers and sisters, let me tell you this truth. Do not be deceived by this lie, this lie is the lie of the CHP.
We have no such thing as a financial salary for Syrians, they are lying. Yes, we provide health support to Syrians in the camps, we provide this support in hospitals, dispensaries, tent cities there, we provide food, clothing and such support in container cities, but there is no such thing as paying them salaries, this is a big lie.
So, who do we give it to? Let me tell you, we provide salaries to the poor and poor people of our country through our governorships and district governorships, and we give them to our citizens. Hey CHP, stop these lies.
And we regard the Syrians in my country as immigrants, they escaped from barrel bombs, they took refuge in us by escaping from those bombs. Didn't this exist in our history? There was. God forbid, what would we do if something like this happened to us? Therefore, do not be deceived by the lies made up by these fraudsters.
And of course, we also have concerns about these disturbing Syrians, so our Police Department takes the necessary precautions, makes the necessary warnings, and the measures at this point are going further every day.
And remember this: As of now, 330 thousand Syrians have already returned to their homeland, and as the struggle there is achieved, hopefully more of them will return to their homes and lands.
Today, we continue on our path with the courage we receive from our nation, without giving thanks to all sanction threats, economic traps and military power displays. Thanks to the management style we have demonstrated in the government and municipalities, we have brought our country to a new era in every field. At a time when the world is drifting towards a dark unknown with trade wars and diplomatic footwork, Turkey is still walking towards its own goals.
Those who are disturbed by the stable course and strong stance of our country are seeking to turn every opportunity into a crisis. When we look back, we see countless examples of this since the Gezi events in 2013. Who was at the Gezi Protests? There was Mr. Kemal. Who was there? He had supporters. In other words, all those who are against us now took part in the Gezi Events. Those who cannot bring Turkey to its knees with their own means are using every means to bring us down from within.
Here I repeat once again; You will not succeed, you will not be able to bring Turkey to its knees. You will not be able to shackle the hands and feet of the Turkish nation. You will not be able to turn this country into a place where destruction, tears, pain, misery and captivity are rampant. You will not be able to pit our people against each other. You will not be able to take away our political, military and economic gains. You will not be able to collapse our production, employment, exports or take our prosperity back.
You will not be able to play the same tricks on the Republic of Turkey, which was born on the ashes of the great World State that you sneakily destroyed a century ago, because this time, there is a Turkey that says we will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be born together as Turkey.
And what was our Rabia, our Rabia? Let's say it enthusiastically, are we ready? One nation... One flag... One homeland... One state... Yes, they will not be able to destroy this Rabia. Hopefully, there is an administration, a President, to whom this nation has given strength with unprecedented support in every election.
O Istanbul, are you ready to bury those who want to use June 23 as a tool of their struggle against Turkey and the Turkish nation in the ballot box?
Hey Istanbul, are you ready to give a solid Ottoman slap at the ballot box to those who are dying to turn the mayoral election of this city into a rematch of 1453?
O Istanbul, while there are so many vital problems in the world and in our region, are you ready to give your answer at the ballot box to those who want to drown Turkey with its own internal conflicts?
Hey Istanbul, whatever the result on Sunday, I repeat, are you ready to work with all your strength for one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state? This is Istanbul, this is Türkiye.
My brothers,
As long as this city and this nation are behind us, with God's permission, it is not possible for any political, military or economic issue to prevent us from achieving our 2023 goals. We trust this city where we were born, grew up, and fought our every struggle together. We worked to serve every person of this city, including men, women, young people, old people, workers, employers, tradesmen and civil servants, with the enthusiasm of worship. We came to this nation not to be masters, but to be servants.
No matter what task we undertake, my brothers, one half of our hearts and our work has always been Istanbul. In these elections, we appeared before you with a name that will bring the best service to Istanbul. We have been working with him since 1994, and together we solved the transportation problem of Istanbul and all of Turkey. He successfully fulfilled the highest responsibilities such as Prime Ministry and Melis Presidency. We said that Istanbul deserves a project man and we appeared before you with Binali Yıldırım as our candidate for Metropolitan Mayor. This will be a period in which we will both put forward all our savings to pay our debt of loyalty to Istanbul.
What does he say now? He says, ""What did we do in 18 days?"" What did you do in 18 days? You only removed the lock of the Vice President's room in 18 days, you did this in 18 days. What can you do in Istanbul in 18 days? Why are you lying? Lie upon lie.
As for our brother Binali, we will work hand in hand with our mayors in 25 districts, with our 180 members in the Metropolitan Municipality Council as the People's Alliance, hand in hand with our Government, and will build the Istanbul of 2023. As the President and the Government, we will stand by him in every field with all our ministries and institutions. Every new service we provide to Istanbul, to which we are attached with deep love and affection, will be a source of pride for us.
We invite everyone who thinks about the future of the city they live in, who wants to solve its problems and troubles, and who does not want this city to be damaged in the hands of marauders, from terrorist organizations to mafia structures, to the polls on June 23.
Remember, the story of Binali Yıldırım, the son of lame Dursun from Erzincan, is the story of every Istanbulite who came from all over our country and settled in this city, either his father or himself. Binali Yıldırım is a brother of ours who successfully fulfills every task he undertakes, completes every project he starts, does what he says and does not say he cannot do it. For this reason, I request Istanbulites living outside the city to come and vote on election day. AK Party organizations in every city are at the disposal of all our citizens in this regard.
My sisters especially have a lot of responsibility for Sunday. As the saying goes, I expect my ladies and sisters not only to vote themselves, but also to mobilize all their family members to go to the polls and make the right choices.
I would also like to make a call to our youth. Guys, let me see your hands. I would like to remind you that Binali Yıldırım is the only person among the candidates who appeals to you from employment to technology, from sports to social activities, and who has projects and the will to implement them. Moreover, I want you to know that not only Binali Yıldırım Bey, but also the President and my Cabinet, we are and will be with you as servants of our youth in every field from education to health. I believe you will make the right choice on Sunday for your own future. I entrust my brother Binali Yıldırım to you.
I greet you all with love and respect, stay healthy.

My dear nation,
Dear Ankara residents,
My dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your love, affection, support and brotherhood. I thank God for giving me companions, companions in the cause, and friends in the struggle like you.
Throughout our political life, we have never pursued any goal other than serving our cause and our nation. We did not recognize any power above the national will. Our nation has been with us in every struggle we have undertaken since the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality in 1994.
My brothers;
As the AK Party, I would like to express my gratitude to every member of my nation who has always made us come first in all parliamentary, presidential, local government elections and referendums since the elections of November 3, 2002.
Our nation placed us first at the ballot box for the 15th time today. As the AK Party, we have won a total of 778 mayoralties in the places where we ran alone or together with the People's Alliance, in 16 metropolitan cities, 24 provinces, 538 districts and 200 towns. This means that approximately 56 percent of the municipalities in our country will be governed by the AK Party.
Some people think they are in the millet warehouse. They need to know this: Has this brother of yours been the President for 4.5 years? Is AK Party in power? Therefore, are we in Parliament as the People's Alliance? And just as we have come so far on this path, we will continue in the same way from now on.
The vote rate of the People's Alliance is at a level similar to the June 24 elections. As the People's Alliance that we established together with both the AK Party and MHP, I would like to express my gratitude once again to our nation who made us first in the ballot box. I would like to thank MHP Chairman Mr. Bahçeli and all my brothers who have devoted themselves to this party for supporting the People's Alliance.
I would like to express a very important issue in particular. I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens, especially my Kurdish brothers, who support our sensitivity on the issue of survival. The election results of our Southeastern Anatolia region are a very important lesson that our Kurdish brothers give to those who put their will on the bargaining table.
I wish success to all our mayors, municipal council members and provincial general council members who took office with the support of their voters in our metropolitan cities, provinces, districts and towns. I also congratulate our headmen who were elected in our neighborhoods and villages, which I see as the first step of democracy.
My brothers;
I see that the only reason why we could not get the results we desired in this election is that we were not able to explain ourselves to our nation sufficiently and enter into their hearts sufficiently. During the official campaign period of only 50 days, we made an effort to express ourselves to our nation with rallies in 59 provinces and 43 districts, and 9 television and social media programs. Despite this, if we have shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them. We cannot look for this in our people, we cannot look for it in our nation, we will look for it in ourselves. Starting tomorrow morning, we will start working to identify and compensate for our shortcomings.
At the moment, the Supreme Electoral Council will announce the results. If we have objections when or until it announces the results, we will raise these objections wherever they are. Whether we get results or not, it doesn't matter. Why? My brothers, remember this: There is good in everything. This is the struggle for democracy.
For example, right now you see that most of the districts in Ankara are under the AK Party, the People's Alliance, and there is such a picture. Currently, more districts in Istanbul than there were until I moved here are in the People's Alliance, or neck and neck, in such a situation. What does this mean? Even if our people gave the metropolitan city as mayor, what did they do with the districts, they gave it to the AK Party, we will focus on these and work well. No one should doubt that we will make every effort necessary, including holding accountable those who damage the heart-to-heart path between us and our nation.
We see politics not as a means of being stubborn with the nation, belittling the nation, or insulting the nation, but only as a means of bringing the best services to the country and the nation. We have done this until now, and we will do this from now on. What will be the end of a politics without a nation? It leads to fascism, it leads to dictatorship, it leads to oppression. For this reason, we have sought the consent and support of our nation in every step we have taken so far. From now on, we will continue on our way in the same way, we will continue with you.
That's why, as I always say, no one, including myself, is bigger than our cause, is not more prioritized than Turkey, is not more important than our party; We will pay attention to this. We all have power and authority in proportion to the services we provide to our cause, our country and our nation, and we are valuable in that proportion.
We cannot direct our country in the same direction without first realizing the continuity of change, which is a fact of life, within ourselves. The coming period will be a period of change for the better and for the better for both our party and our country. No elections, no elections for 4.5 years. What are we going to do? We will focus on our work both nationally and internationally, we will be focused and hopefully raise our country above the level of contemporary civilizations.
We will try to make the most efficient use of this upcoming long period. With who? With my nation, with you. We will struggle to resolve all of our country's outstanding issues with a reformist approach.
We have significantly prevented attacks aimed at taking over our country and nation in the economy. We will definitely build a more resistant economic architecture against such attacks through structural reforms. By continuing the employment campaign we have initiated with determination, we will foil the tricks of those who covet our people's jobs, food and bread. Those who make false promises are welcome, let's see how they will govern. In this process that continues until we reach our 2023 goals, our priority will be to strengthen our economy, continue to grow with a focus on technology and exports, and increase employment.
Likewise, we are entering a period in which we will hopefully achieve success in our work on issues related to our national security. We had already partially foiled the trap set against our country along our Syrian border. Now our goal is to eliminate the terrorist structures in Manbij and the east of the Euphrates, to make Syria a safe place and to ensure that the refugees in our country can return to their homes and homelands.
My brothers;
Our new management system has been in effect for approximately 9 months. In light of the results we have obtained from this implementation period, we will especially continue to strengthen the system with new reforms that will complete the deficiencies and overcome the blockages within the framework of fast and effective decision-making and implementation. And my brothers, we will take all necessary steps in our ministries and institutions, if necessary, in accordance with the dynamic structure of the system. We always say something with some provocative expressions, what is it? No stopping, keep going... We will continue our struggle on this long, narrow road day and night. May God help us. I hope that the election results will be beneficial to our country and cities once again.
But I ask one thing in particular from you, my dear brothers and sisters; Don't be offended, don't be offended, don't say 'we didn't expect this result'; There is no need for such a thing. We have a party that received 52 percent of the votes. The leading party in this election is the AK Party. Let others think, we have nothing to think about at this point. But we say further, we say further, and for this reason, we will compensate for our shortcomings in this election and hopefully continue on our way with different working principles.
I would like to thank each and every one of you for embracing us with love, affection, appreciation, and loyalty to our covenant during this cold night. I praise my Lord again; O Lord, I cannot praise you enough for blessing me with such companions. Thank you, long live, God bless you.

"Their Speech at the 8 March International Women's Day Meeting Called ""Our Hearts' Language Under the Same Sky""",2019-03-08,"

Very dear ladies,
Dear guests,
My dear young brothers and sisters;
I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I congratulate all women of our country and the world on March 8, International Women's Day.
It is not up to us to be born as a man or a woman, it is the Creator's decision as to which gender we will start life with. Our duty, whether we are men or women, is to lead our lives in the best way, in accordance with our nature, within the framework of divine order.
Just as we cannot classify people just because of their color, just their social status, just their level of education, or just their income level, we cannot resort to such a method because of their gender. Because every human being is an honorable creature, that is, the most honorable of creatures. Essentially, one side of the being we call human is female and the other side is male, and they only gain meaning when they come together. Anyone who discriminates against Nisa, that is, a human woman, just because of her gender, acts contrary to our Lord's will.
As in many parts of the world, many injustices have been done to women in our country. What's worse is that injustices against women are sometimes disguised as religious and sometimes cultural. Those who say they set out to save women from such injustices have brought them to the brink of a much greater disaster.
That's why we have always struggled throughout our lives to ensure that women are treated the way they deserve, that is, as human beings. We believed that violence, injustice and ill-treatment against women directly targeted people, and we carried out our struggle accordingly. We have always stood by our women, sometimes even at the expense of disagreements with those closest to us. We have strived to bring our women to the place they deserve in all areas of life. We have personally made a great effort and contribution, especially in bringing the weight of women in politics to the level it is today.
We walked with our women wherever I took responsibility in politics, starting from my candidacy for Istanbul Provincial Presidency and Beyoğlu Mayor in 1989. During my tenure as Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, women were at the forefront not only in political but also in all social activities. During my term as Prime Minister, solving women's issues has always been at the top of my priorities. We acted with the same sensitivity during our presidency. Today, if the AK Party has become the party with the largest and most effective Women's Branch Organization in Turkey, it is thanks to these efforts. I would like to express my gratitude to all our ladies and sisters who have been with me in every struggle for nearly 40 years and contributed to my every success.
The ladies in my family life, especially my late mother, my wife and daughters, have always been my greatest source of motivation, inspiration and biggest supporter. You know, we always say 'touched by women's hands', and Tayyip Erdoğan has come to this day thanks to the touch of women's hands.
Dear ladies;
Anatolia means Anatolian woman; Because the Anatolian woman, just like this land, is a sufferer, a founder, a builder, and always a survivor. If we can embrace these lands as our homeland today, our women have a very important role in this. It is women who continue to smoke the chimneys of their houses and stoves in every difficult period, raise their children, produce with all their might, and keep our hope fresh.
My brothers;
Life shows us that women can be stronger than men in the face of difficulties. For example, I will tell you something very interesting, as you know very well, the word ""tarhana"", like tarhana soup, comes from the ""dar household"", and the famous ezogelin soup refers to the same skill. These are the solutions that our women came up with with their practical intelligence in poverty. Whatever the circumstances, the woman's family knows that they must keep the pot boiling and acts accordingly. He vomits blood when necessary, but says he drank cranberry sherbet and protects his family and keeps them together.
In the past, there was an expression called ""Ottoman woman"", this expression was used for women who were the locomotive of their families with their wisdom, knowledge, ability to manage and find solutions. An African proverb says, 'Until lions have their own historians, tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.' Until women own their own success, success stories will always glorify men. However, whatever happens and is achieved in life, there is a man on one side and a woman on the other, anything else is against creation.
There have always been symbolic women in our history, as it was just said, we cannot understand the Seljuks without knowing Terken Hatun. We cannot ignore the role of Mother Hayme in the establishment of the Ottoman World State. We cannot understand how we turned Anatolia into a homeland without examining the Greek Sisters. We cannot explain our struggle for liberation without reminding us of Nene Hatun in Erzurum, Rahmiye Ana in Adana, Nezahat Corporal in Kütahya, Şerife Bacı in Kastamonu. We can never forget the heroism displayed by many women, some civilians and some public servants, in the fight against terrorism.
My ladies and sisters;
We will remember with gratitude our women who stood like lions against the coup plotters on the night of July 15 throughout our lives. These are the most concrete examples of why we need to bring our women to the place they deserve in social life, politics, commerce and education.
We give priority to women at every level in our own party. Look, I'm going to tell you something here, tell this to other political party members, do you know how many women members we have in the Women's Branch of the AK Party? We have 4.5 million female members. We have a larger base than the total number of votes, let alone the number of members, of many political parties. Our Youth Branch has nearly 1.5 million members, among whom our girls serve very actively and enthusiastically.
Our women are represented at very high rates everywhere, from university lecturers to judicial positions, from teaching to diplomats, from architecture to banking. In the last elections, women's representation in the Parliament reached 104 deputies and reached the highest level in our history with a representation rate of 17.5 percent. We have 2 female ministers in the cabinet and 4 female deputy ministers, all of these are important; but not enough. Hopefully, in the coming period, we will strive to provide our women with the opportunities they deserve in all areas of life.
Now, I have a request from you, my ladies and sisters, I see there is Şanlıurfa, I see there is Gaziantep, I see there is Adıyaman, my brothers, the March 31 elections are very important for this, I want our ladies and sisters not to leave their homes until we have participated in these elections, are we ready for this? Even though digitalization affects politics, ru-be-ru can never replace face-to-face relationships, communication and bonding.
Ladies, are we ready to not leave a house or a heart untouched until March 31st? Ladies, are we ready to carry the service policy to victory on March 31? Ladies, are we ready to vote with victory and success for whole-hearted municipalism at the ballot box on March 31? Ladies, do we protect our future, the ballot box, and democracy on March 31? Ladies, do we stand for peace, tranquility and stability on March 31? Ladies, are we protecting the ballot boxes on March 31? We brought Turkey to this day with you, and we will build Turkey's future together with you.
My brothers;
Our family institution is the value that we should protect the most and be most careful about. The Western world has destroyed the family institution, and now the foundations of their societies are crumbling. Because they made the family worthless yesterday, today they cannot effectively combat many social problems such as addiction, alcohol and drugs.
One of the most important reasons why we, as a country and nation, have survived all the troubles we have experienced so far is the strength of our family structure.
For this reason, we have been under attacks aimed at shaking our family structure for a long time. Moreover, these attacks are always carried out indirectly. For this purpose, when we look at the distorted forms of social relations imposed on our nation through the media, we see that they all target the family first. When we separate the individual from his family, it becomes easier to manipulate, shape, intimidate, manipulate and use him as you wish. Those who set out to say 'we are breaking taboos' end up condemning our people to greater taboos and separating them from their families; Unfortunately, we have to admit that this game was partially successful.
My ladies and sisters;
Especially with the increase in urbanization, unfortunately, the extended family structure consisting of grandparents, mother, father, children and grandchildren has disappeared to a great extent, and now we have returned to the nuclear family. Some people cannot even tolerate this and are looking for ways and means to separate children from their families as soon as possible. We will never allow such a disaster.
Some people are trying to portray my recommendation of at least 3 children as an intervention in private life. However, with this advice, I both protect our population, which is our greatest strength, and struggle to keep our family structure alive.
Of course, Urfa's report card is very bright in this regard. Urfa is one of the provinces with the highest number of children in our country. We should spread this sample table to our other provinces, right? Turkey's resources are sufficient to accommodate more population. The family structure, reduced to a micro level with one child or two children, and completely dispersed after the end of the education process, is the biggest threat to our future.
No family should hesitate to have more children because they are worried about their future. Remember, “Er-rizku a’l Allah”, sustenance is from Allah. Our state also supports every family; We support our citizens with family social support programs, family support centers, social service and social solidarity centers, pre-marriage education programs, family education programs, family counseling, dowry and housing account supports.
We support every member of our nation, in good times and bad times, with countless services for women, children, young people, the elderly and the disabled. We are in a constant effort to ensure that our people can continue their lives without worrying about their future and livelihood with our employment mobilization and support.
According to our belief, every child is born with his own destiny and blessings, let's know it that way. Today I thank God for having 4 children. But little; I wish there were more. I currently have 7 grandchildren; But it's a little bit, hopefully we expect the rest. Mashallah, look, hands rise and say ""I have 10"". Mashallah, may Allah do more. Hopefully, we will encourage and support our nation more in this regard in the coming period.
For this reason, we must firmly protect democracy, the ballot box, the national will and our future in the March 31 elections. My ladies and sisters; Are we setting a record for the AK Party, which was always with you and worked for you on March 31? Ladies, are we carrying the municipalism of heart to victory everywhere on March 31 for the future of you and your children? Ladies, are we starting a new era to build a great and powerful Turkey together on March 31? Ladies, are we exploding the ballot boxes with a woman's touch on March 31? Ladies, are we turning the evening of March 31 into a wedding night with our victory?
Do we know Rabia, are we ready for Rabia? Let's say it very enthusiastically, let Türkiye hear it. One nation... One flag... One homeland... One state... We will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together!
May God bless you all. Once again, I congratulate you on March 8, International Women's Day. I offer my love to all the ladies who are our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and grandchildren. I offer my respects to all the ladies who make up half of humanity, our hearts, our hearts and our dreams.
Remember, women are very important in our religion. What does our beloved Prophet (PBUH) say: “El-Heaven is the throne akdâmi'l-ummehât; ""Heaven is under the feet of mothers,"" he says. Not your fathers. Therefore, young people, if your mothers are alive, do not hesitate to kiss the bottom of their feet. Kiss it, don't forget there is the smell of heaven there, okay.
I entrust you all to God, thank you, long live.

Their Speech in the Program “Turkey's Largest Farmer Family is in the Nation's Home”,2019-03-06,"

Dear managers of our Agricultural Credit central and regional unions,
Dear members of our Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Association,
Distinguished guests;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation, this veteran place.
I find such meetings, which lead to the meeting of the People and the President, really important. I am very pleased to be with you today on the occasion of the General Assembly of our Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Union.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Cooperation and solidarity are in the essence, soul and essence of our culture. The Ahi institution has kept this nation alive both materially and spiritually for centuries. In those difficult times when there were no technological tools in Anatolia, work was done collaboratively for centuries. The fields were cleared in this way, the threshing floor was plowed in this way, and the needs were met in this way.
Our Agricultural Credit Cooperatives, which were established to serve our farmers and have been operating since 1863, are the product of this understanding, this cooperation and solidarity. Agricultural Credit Cooperatives serve our farmers with a structure that always strives to achieve better, based on voluntary participation, democratic control, cooperation and social responsibility.
Today, this organization is the largest farmer organization in our country with thousands of cooperatives and hundreds of thousands of partners. Our Agricultural Credit Cooperatives, which bring the products purchased from their partners at their value to the consumers, are also the main supplier of the arranged sales application that we have implemented in the past weeks. A significant portion of our producers' inputs are covered by our Union.
Last year, our union sold 2 billion 100 million lira of fertilizer, approximately 2.5 billion lira of feed, 1 billion 250 million lira of diesel, 550 million lira of seeds, 400 million lira of agricultural equipment and machinery, and 300 million lira of coal to our farmers. With this sales figure reaching 8 billion liras in total, our farmers were supported in every field. The loan figure opened by our association last year, which meets the needs of its partners such as seeds, fertilizers, diesel fuel, pesticides, irrigation systems, greenhouse products, seedlings and saplings, is exactly 9 billion lira. The average loan provided by our association to each partner, mostly in kind, is 19 thousand liras.
The cooperatives that are members of our Union are among those who benefit most from rural development projects. I believe that our union will continue to stand by our farmers in the coming period. As the Government, we have made and continue to make every effort to support our farmers.
We are making 2019 support payments quickly. We made 5 billion lira support payments to our farmers in the first 2 months of the year. Here, I would like to share with you the good news of the supports to be made in March: 2 billion liras in area-based supports, 730 million liras in calf supports, 198 million liras in other livestock supports, 80 million liras in forage crops supports and other issues such as irrigation electricity and certified seeds in March. We will make support payments totaling 3 billion 716 million liras, 148 million liras in total. Thus, we will provide 8 billion 777 million liras of support to our farmers and producers in the first three months of the year. I hope that all these support payments will be beneficial to our producers.
My dear brothers and sisters;
We are a management that knows very well the importance of agriculture and animal husbandry for our country. The 126.8 billion lira support payment we have made to our farmers to date is the most concrete expression of this. In 2002, Turkey had a size of not even 37 billion liras in terms of agricultural national income. Our agricultural product exports were at the level of 3.7 billion dollars. The annual agricultural support given to our farmers barely reached 1.8 billion lira. We have taken Turkey from this level to 190 billion liras in agricultural national income, 17.7 billion dollars in agricultural product exports, and nearly 16.1 billion liras in agricultural supports as of this year. Today, our country ranks first in Europe in terms of agricultural output; from where to where. This is not talk, I am explaining the official figures to you now.
We are carrying out many studies to further strengthen our position in the agricultural sector. One of these is land consolidation. This project first started, look, this is very important, from 1960 to 2002, a total of 450 thousand hectares of land consolidation could be achieved in 42 years. Please pay attention to this figure in the past 10 years, we have completed land consolidation in an area of ​​6.1 million hectares. Registration procedures are currently ongoing in 3.6 million hectares of land.
In order to increase the interest of the young population in the agricultural sector, we provide 30 thousand lira grant support to our young farmers. There was no such thing, we are doing this. Why? We do this so that we can prepare our young people for both today and tomorrow. Within the scope of this practice, which covers a wide area from animal husbandry to plant production to medicinal and aromatic plants, we have supported nearly 48 thousand young farmers in the last 3 years with a resource amounting to 1.5 billion liras.
Another important step we have taken is to prevent the division of agricultural lands through inheritance and sale. In this way, we have prevented the division of approximately 1 million hectares of land to date.
We declare our plains where agriculture and animal husbandry are carried out as protected areas to protect them, otherwise it would be a shame. These lands should not be used randomly; if it is agriculture, we should use it for agriculture. Otherwise, if we erect concrete piles in every agricultural area, we will betray this country, we will betray this nation. We have currently declared 258 of our plains as protected areas, and we will soon increase this number to 300. In this way, we will prevent the concreting of these plains and ensure that they remain only agricultural areas.
As in every business, money, that is, finance, is very important in the agricultural sector. Last year alone, we provided loans of approximately 32 billion lira to our farmers through Ziraat Bank and approximately 6.4 billion lira through agricultural credit cooperatives. I also think it is important that the return rate of these loans is at 98 percent, 99 percent at these levels. Do you know what this means? My farmer is reliable, my farmer is trustworthy, he comes and pays the loan on time, this means 98-99 percent. Besides, you see that in other places, many of the borrowers pay the debt, but the farmer does not, the farmer is the owner of the debt.
The amount of grain produced in our country increased from 30.8 million tons to 34.5 million tons, the amount of fruit increased from 13.3 million tons to 20.5 tons, and the amount of vegetables increased from 25.8 million tons to 30 million tons. The fact that our crop production has increased from 98 million tons to 117 million tons in total is a sign that we have received the reward of the support we provide to agriculture.
These figures better show the purpose of the games staged by some speculators, sometimes over the products that our citizens use most, such as potatoes, onions, sometimes tomatoes, peppers and eggplants. The aim of speculators is not to protect the rights, laws and interests of farmers and producers; While some of them act only with the ambition of profit, some of them have deeper ambitions. Together with our nation, we will continue to disrupt such schemes, just like every game played on our country.
I am calling out to my entire country through my farmer brothers; We will not allow anyone to covet neither the sweat and labor of our producers nor the tables and bread of our consumers. We see speculators in the agricultural sector as a national security problem, just like terrorists who come to our borders, and we treat them accordingly.
Of course, the fact that we added 563 to the number of dams in our country, which was 276, 350 to the number of ponds, which was 228, and 1332 to the number of irrigation facilities, which was 1764, played a major role in these developments. Do you know how we increased the irrigation area of ​​a giant project like GAP from 200 thousand hectares? We increased it to 560 thousand hectares. Ilısu Dam, which ranks 4th in the world in its field, is about to be completed, hopefully we will start to hold water this year.
How hard did we deal with these terrorists, how long did we deal with the PKK terrorist organization? Do you know how many obstacles they tried to create to prevent us from building the Ilısu Dam and to prevent the construction of dams in other places, Tunceli, Siirt and many other places? Do you know what's wrong? If those dams were built, they could not pass through them, so they always tried to prevent the construction of these dams. Despite these terrorist organizations, we built our dams, we are building them and we will do them.
Because there is electrical energy here. Where do we install hydroelectric power plants? We are installing here. There is irrigation here, we irrigate all these agricultural lands with what we use. We have drinking water facilities here. Can we leave these aside? At the same time, there is environmental urbanism here. In many of them, you see that fishing is done at a certain point. With all this, our country becomes richer.
We are approaching the end of the Silvan Dam, which is the largest in Europe in its class, and hopefully we will get it done, too. Hopefully, we are laying the foundation of one of the most important tunnels of the Silvan Dam these days, and we are also accelerating the work on the other tunnel. Thus, when our dam starts to hold water, the tunnels and irrigation facilities will be completed.
Do you know what the contribution of irrigation within the scope of GAP to our country is? The contribution to energy is 2.2 billion dollars, the contribution to energy is 4 billion dollars, and the contribution to drinking water is 500 million dollars. When all stages of this project are put into service, we will open 1 million 58 thousand hectares of land to irrigation, thus our country's agricultural production will increase tremendously in both quality and quantity.
As you can see, these things are possible with long-term work and very serious investments, this cannot be done with lies and cheating, this cannot be done with slander, you will work, you will work, you will produce. If these happen, there will be a result, if these do not happen, there will be no result. We adjust our plans, programs and investments accordingly.
Dear friends;
What is one of the most discussed issues in our country? It is animal husbandry. Although we have worked hard on this issue, unfortunately, I have to admit that we still cannot offer meat to our citizens at affordable prices at the level we want. Essentially, when we look at the figures, our situation in animal husbandry is getting better day by day. For example, do you know how much cattle we had in 2002? It was 9.9 million units, that is, 10 million units, thankfully this figure surpassed 17.2 million units. There is also an increase in the number of small ruminants, from approximately 32 million to 46.1 million. As for our milk production, which is an important indicator of animal husbandry, we increased from 8.4 million tons to 22.1 million tons. Likewise, our red meat production increased from 420 thousand tons to 1 million 118 thousand tons, our chicken e-commerce production increased from 700 thousand tons to 2 million 156 thousand tons, our egg production increased from 11.5 billion to 19.6 billion units, and our dairy products production increased from 61 thousand tons to 276 thousand tons. rose to tone; There is no regression, we are always rising, we will rise even higher.
As a matter of fact, do you know what the annual milk consumption per capita in our country has become, thanks to these increases in production? It increased from 122 liters to 258 liters, and red meat consumption increased from 6.1 kilos to 15 kilos. As can be seen, our consumption has increased more than our production. Therefore, what we need to do is to encourage more affordable production by reducing input costs.
We know the problems experienced in animal husbandry, especially in feed and fertilizer in field crops. There is foreign dependency in terms of raw materials for both products. To achieve this, we need to start by increasing feed and fertilizer production. Türkiye should be an exporter, not an importer, in these matters. This is one of the goals of our national unity project in agriculture. We aim to reduce imports and increase exports by switching to planned production.
We will resolutely implement the basin-based management and agricultural production support model and the domestic production support model in livestock. We identified 21 products and 945 locations for basin-based production. Hopefully, we will boost our agricultural sector by supporting wheat and forage crops everywhere and other products in designated areas.
We started by encouraging breeding production in order to develop livestock for export beyond meeting our own needs. Hopefully, as Turkey grows, develops and becomes richer, our farmers and producers will also get their share. Especially when we reach our 2023 targets, we will hopefully triple or 5-fold the numbers we are currently talking about.
Dear friends;
We have grown our country 3.5 times in the past 17 years. In order to be among the 10 largest economies in the world, we need to achieve at least two-fold growth in the coming period.
I know that we have brothers here who are committed to every party. That's why it's not like a football team accepts what I say from you; But I want you to evaluate with common sense beyond the glasses of politics, acting with the understanding of 'skill is subject to compliment', looking at who provided what service and who provides what service. I believe that when you do this, we will have the opportunity to see the truth better and understand the games played today.
Whenever we get closer to our goals as a country and nation, we immediately encounter some obstacles. A number of scenarios are put into circulation. Remember 2013, we paid off the debt to the IMF in May 2013. What was this debt? When we took office, at the end of 2002, we had a debt of 23.5 billion dollars. And we zeroed out this debt in May 2013 and, thank God, we have no problems with the IMF now, we have no dealings with it, that job is over, we closed that book. Now we continue on our way with our own means and power.
In the same year, 2002, the foreign exchange reserves of our Central Bank were 27.5 billion dollars, and at one point during my prime ministry, we went up to 136 billion dollars. However, due to certain crises, we fell to 80 for a while, but now we have climbed again and our Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves have reached 100 billion dollars. We will go further, we will rise higher, we will become stronger, we will do this together.
One by one, we are implementing projects that the world watches with admiration. Not only that, we were holding the hands of all the oppressed, the victimized and the strange in our region and around the world. What happened? Suddenly, we found ourselves with the Gezi events that caused chaos in the streets. With the latest accusation that can be made against a party like the AK Party, which increased Turkey's forest assets from 20.8 million hectares to 22.6 million hectares and planted 4 billion 300 million saplings, they created havoc with the lie that we cut down trees. If this country is going green, it became green with us, it is going green with us. When the true face of this game was revealed, that mob that was terrorizing the streets quietly left.
Then came the 17-25 December Police-Judiciary coup attempt. Then, they left no stone unturned in the local elections in March 2014 and the Presidential elections in August of the same year. Thank God, we have overcome all these troubles with the support of our nation. You remember the sass and disdainful attitudes towards the nation in the elections in June 2015, when no party in the Parliament could gain the majority to form a government on its own, right? Thereupon, we immediately held an early election and our nation said 'a game is being played here' and brought us to power again on our own.
The separatist terrorist organization immediately took action and unfortunately, our country, especially Southeastern Anatolia, was devastated and disgraced with the trenches opened by the work machines of the municipalities in those pits. And we put the trustee issue into action through the judiciary within the framework of the law and we got this from them. Because we were not in a position to continue our journey with those who probably sent the money sent by the state to Qandil. And now we have farmer brothers from Diyarbakır among us. Now, when I look at Diyarbakır like Istanbul or Ankara, maybe there are no four departures or four arrivals in Istanbul or Ankara. On the other side, you see side roads, cafeterias, etc., the youth is there.
Likewise, Van, Ağrı, Şırnak, all the rising buildings, Hakkari, all the rising buildings, thanks to our trustees, they were handled and built, the houses are being finished one by one and handed over to their owners. Now, there is a Tigris tribe in Diyarbakır, you see picnic areas there, etc. These are my citizens, all my people living there, and we have provided them with the opportunity to live happily with their children.
This is not discrimination, what is discrimination? Those who dig that hole are the ones who make that discrimination. And by killing thousands of our children through this terrorist organization, they brought division in this country. I guess we did not activate our security forces out of the blue, we took this step for the peace of this country. Why shouldn't my industrialists and investors go to the Southeast and invest? Why can't he? My dear brothers and sisters, how can he make this investment when he has no security? Will those who kidnap the architect, engineer and everything of the factory to build a factory, and those who threaten those who built the factory, go and invest there? In order for an investment to take place, there must be security, there must be trust, there must be stability. When this does not happen, you cannot go anywhere and invest. What problems arise when this investment is not made? There is an employment shortage. But if these investments had been made, thousands, tens of thousands of people would have found employment opportunities there, and we are reversing these. Hopefully this will work out very soon.
They saw that, of course, this is not the case. This time, a treason gang nestled within our army through the FETO terrorist organization attempted to stage a bloody coup on July 15. Our nation defended its independence and future and foiled this coup attempt. July 15 has taken its place as a glorious page in the history of this country and nation. On this occasion, I remember with mercy our martyrs of the fight against terrorism and July 15, and wish our veterans good health and well-being.
Our transition to the Presidential Government System has actually been the most fundamental and powerful response our nation has given to these attacks. Regarding Syria, which is the most important threat to our country, we changed the course of events with our determination regarding Manbij and the east of the Euphrates, with the initiative we developed in Idlib in our Operations Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch. But you see, the head of the main opposition says, ""Why should YPG, PYD, PKK attack us?"" Well, what kind of understanding is this? To those who ask the question 'Why would they attack us?' I say, well, he attacked, he attacked, there is no need to ask questions. They are the ones who fired the missiles and they are the ones who caused the martyrdom of nearly 100 of my citizens. There is a main opposition that is too far from the truth to see these.
Finally, in August last year, this time they pulled the economic gun. They tried to sink our economy and destabilize our administration by creating a completely artificial vortex that had nothing to do with Turkey's realities. We were immediately aware of this game, implemented our measures, and regained control with a strong economic program.
Now they are waiting for March 31 with one last hope. If they can create an environment of instability as they wish in these elections, they are planning to launch new attacks on our country from all fronts. But I promise here in the presence of our farmers and producers that we will never give them an opportunity. I hope we will defeat this game again, arm in arm and heart to heart, with our nation, all together.
Dear friends;
If you ask what has been the biggest misfortune of our country in this entire process, I have to say, with a heavy heart, the situation of the CHP. My dear brothers and sisters, the history of this party is already full of bad records, from Sivaslı Nuri Demirağ to Vecihi Hürkuş to the Devrim automobile trial. You know best the damage they caused to democracy and law with their attitude in the Presidential elections in 2007.
CHP has never stood by our country and nation in attacks by terrorist organizations, coup attempts, or threats against our country from abroad. Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu goes to Europe and takes pictures with the representatives of the terrorist organization in Germany, side by side with rags in their hands; Look at the situation. Well, you are the head of the main opposition of this country, how can you pose side by side with a terrorist who poses with YPG rags in the German Parliament? How can you justify it?
They have persistently continued all kinds of wrong attitudes, from complaining about Turkey to the world to trying to block all strategic initiatives of our country. We are making UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, we are making armed unmanned aerial vehicles, the man is uncomfortable with this. When we took office, 20 percent of our defense industry was local, but now, alhamdulillah, 65 percent is local.
They said, 'We will buy the gun we want from America, 1500 guns for our police, from there.' 'Congress did not allow it.' In fact, these are now being done in Turkey. And America did not even give those 1500 pistols. What happened? Of course, these neighbors are known neighbors, you understand, they made us homeowners, now we produce these.
I asked them for the unmanned aerial vehicle in the early days of my Prime Ministry, but they did not give it to me again. They said, 'Let them know for 48 hours and let the unmanned aerial vehicles work for you.' And my dear brothers, the moment they approached most positively was during the time of the son Bush, that's all. But what happened? We said that it won't work like this, it's best if we produce it ourselves. Thanks to the private sector, we managed to achieve this and we began to produce and export it at the same time. But it is not enough, we will go further, we need to solve these.
Finally, this party took action, look, this is very important, it took the Presidential decree regarding the establishment of the Turkish Space Agency to the Constitutional Court to annul it. This is the first time I'm voicing this here today. I wonder why this CHP is disturbed by Turkey taking its place in the space race? We build satellites, we launch satellites, and we strive to use space studies effectively in every field, from communications to intelligence. I submit to the appreciation of all my farmer brothers and sisters how preventing the activities of the Turkish Space Agency, which will carry all these studies further, will benefit the interests of the country and the nation.
Rest assured, everything they do is like this. They do not lay brick after brick, they do not sign any work or project; They have been keeping watch in front of the Constitutional Court for a long time to prevent those who do this. Some like-minded professional organizations never leave the Council of State and the Supreme Court idle. With God's permission and the support of our nation, we are and will overcome terrorist organizations and the forces that support them.
But of course we have a problem, you know, when the thief is from inside, the door won't be locked, there is a saying like that, when the dagger hits from the inside, we don't have much to do. As always, we are looking for the solution in our farmers, we are looking for the solution in our nation, we are looking for the solution in the national will, we are looking for the solution in democracy.
Hopefully, the March 31 elections will result in a way that we will elect the best mayors to serve our cities and that we will spend the next period in a climate of peace, stability and trust.
With these feelings, I would like to express my gratitude to you, my dear farmer brothers, for your contributions to the development and development of our country, and to the uninterrupted provision of vaccines and bread for our nation.
I hope that the General Assembly of our Central Union of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives will be beneficial, and I especially ask you to convey my greetings and respect to all our citizens when you return to your cities.
Stay healthy.

Their Speech at the Türkiye Tradesmen's Meeting,2019-02-13,"

Dear managers of our chambers, unions, federations and confederations,
My dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Likewise, I would like to convey these feelings to my brothers who could not enter the hall but were outside and welcome them as well.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank our Ministry of Commerce and tradesmen organizations for bringing us together in this beautiful environment. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your love, enthusiasm and affection. I greet all my tradesmen and artisan brothers in our country.
I see our tradesmen and craftsmen as the keystone of our country and the cement of our unity and solidarity. In our eyes, tradesmen are the external members of our households. From the moment we step out of the door, we live our lives in a face-to-face, ruberu relationship with them every day.
Tradesmen are the grocer, greengrocer, marketer, butcher, stationer, glassware store, hardware store, haberdasher, kiosk store, baker, money changer. Tradesmen are the barbers we shave with, the hairdressers for women, the restaurants we eat with, the patisserie sellers, the taxi drivers we take, the minibus drivers, the bus drivers. A tradesman is the coffee shop owner where we drink tea, a tailor with whom we have our clothes tailored, a shoemaker with whom we have our shoes made, a mechanic who fixes our broken things, in short, a tradesman is the person we are with at every moment of our lives.
We share our troubles and joys with them, we ask for help when necessary, we come to their aid when necessary. In fact, when necessary, the grocer has a notebook in front of him, which is like a loan from the grocer to us. When we get the salary, we pay the expenses, and this is how life goes. We entrust our house, car keys, bags and documents to them. If he is our peer or younger, he is our brother, and if he is our elder, he is our older brother. For this reason, the well-being, peace, prosperity and happiness of the tradesmen are very important to us. Whatever the effect of the trouble in the family is on us, the effect of the trouble in the tradesman is the same.
As a brother of yours who has worked as a tradesman in the food industry in the past and has achieved this title and this honor, I understand you best. During my term as mayor, chairman and president, I always gave special importance to meeting with our tradesmen whenever I had the opportunity. Believe me, I cannot find the pleasure of a cup of tea or a conversation I had with you anywhere else. By the way, of course, I cannot forget your treats. I don't know if there is any other statesman in Turkey who has such a close and sincere conversation with tradesmen and craftsmen. For this reason, we have tried to bring the best services to our tradesmen and craftsmen for 17 years. You are the closest witness to what we do for our tradesmen. However, I would like to remind you of some information to refresh your memory.
My brothers;
In our country, we have 1 million 756 thousand tradesmen and craftsmen affiliated with more than 3 thousand chambers. When we think together with their families, we come across a segment of society with a population of 8-10 million.
The biggest problem of our tradesmen is the difficulties they experience in financing. We are the government that reduced the interest rate of tradesman loans from 47 percent to 4-5 percent to zero percent. We prevented you from being crushed under the interest burden by increasing the interest subsidy we provide for the loans used by our tradesmen from 20 percent to between 50 and 100 percent. By increasing the credit limits, we have ensured that you receive money that will actually work, not just for show. Currently, our tradesmen and craftsmen can use loans between 200 thousand liras and 500 thousand liras.
To date, we have given loans worth 100 billion liras to nearly 2 million tradesmen, just through the Turkish Tradesmen and Craftsmen Credit Cooperatives. Look, I'm not making up words, we're talking about what we do. Do you know the amount of the cooperative guaranteed loan that we will provide through Halkbank this year alone? 22 billion lira.
The fact that the legal follow-up receivables in cooperative guaranteed loans is close to zero, thank God, points to the morality and loyalty of our tradesmen and craftsmen. By extending loan maturities to 5 years, 7 years, and in some cases even 10 years, we have created an opportunity for our tradesmen and craftsmen to use their income for their business rather than giving all their earnings to the bank.
For all these works, we have placed 7 billion lira of Treasury support at the disposal of our tradesmen and craftsmen in the past 17 years. The number of tradesmen and craftsmen who expanded, maintained and developed their businesses by using loans last year is close to 494 thousand.
We didn't just stop there, we ensured that our tradesmen and craftsmen could look forward by restructuring their debts, especially during difficult times. KOSGEB support programs are another important opportunity we provide to our tradesmen and craftsmen. Last year, nearly 26 thousand tradesmen and craftsmen received 431 million lira of KOSGEB support.
By bringing together the registry and chamber records in the database of our Ministry, we ensured that the transactions proceed quickly and healthily. We started to use TOKİ effectively in the construction of small industrial sites that serve our tradesmen and craftsmen all over our country. We are expanding this practice, which started in Kayseri, to Bursa, Bolu, Uşak, Istanbul and Trabzon provinces.
Tradesmen and craftsmen councils are important meetings where your issues are discussed in detail, solutions are determined and road maps are drawn. We have held 5 councils so far, and we hope to hold the 6th council next year. We are disseminating the activities that will keep the Ahi culture alive.
We passed a law that regulates the retail sector in line with the demands of our tradesmen and craftsmen, and we have solved many issues from working hours and days to document order. We lay the groundwork for producing long-term, realistic, applicable and sustainable policies through tradesmen and artisan sector analyses.
We have constantly made arrangements in the tax legislation in favor of our tradesmen and craftsmen. We have lightened your burden by increasing the tax-exempt earnings amount to 11 thousand lira. We abolished the social security support premium for our tradesmen and craftsmen who continue to run their businesses after retirement.
Last year, we introduced an SCT exemption for taxis, minibuses, minibuses and buses serving in urban transportation. We extended the SCT and VAT discount on commercial vehicles until the end of March. We didn't do this, you asked for it, we did it.
We did not forget the tradesmen who paid their taxes regularly and provided them with a 5-point discount. We have implemented many regulations, from redetermination of professions to record amnesty, from movable pledge to the establishment of the Ahilik Fund, from energy support to premium support for new workplaces.
We have only one goal in all these works, and that is to comfort our tradesmen and craftsmen, to ensure that they can do their job better, and to contribute to their ability to see their future better, because we love you for the sake of God. We see your well-being as our own well-being, your comfort as our own comfort, and your development as our own development.
We brought Turkey to this day with you, you stood by us in every struggle we fought. You were with us in our fight against tutelage, you were with us in the Gezi events, FETO's 17-25 December police-judiciary coup attempt, PKK's trench actions, DAESH's attacks, and 15 July coup attempt. Together with you, we have faced every attack against our country from abroad and domestically. Thank God, we have grown Turkey 3.5 times in 17 years and made it one of the most prestigious countries in the region and the world.
My brothers;
Don't we have problems? Of course there is. Especially last August, we all experienced serious difficulties due to the economic attack carried out in the exchange rate-interest-inflation triangle. Instead of fighting together with our nation, tradesmen and craftsmen against these attacks, there were some people who tried to take opportunism, and we did not leave the field to them. Opportunists can be encountered everywhere, we fight against opportunists both in politics and trade. Our nation is rightfully very angry at the opportunists who directly affect their daily lives, especially the prices of vegetables and fruits, and we are also angry, that's why we decided to establish these regulated sales. From where? We took this decision to prevent these brokers from selling goods to my citizens at high prices.
Yesterday I was in Kastamonu and Çorum, before that I was in Aydın and I asked there as well, I saw that, alhamdulillah, my citizens are happy with the situation, now the prices have halved here. Now, in the next period, after the election, I hope you will sit and talk about the organization of our municipalities and TESK, TESKOMB and relevant ministries. Maybe we can take steps to carry out these works together with you, even to the most remote corners, with the organization of the municipalities.
What is our problem? Our problem is to sell cheap products to our people and citizens. The problem is not only apples, pears, potatoes, onions, tomatoes and green peppers, but also all of these, from cleaning products to many other items, is to sell cheap products to our public, we need to ensure this.
You are the children of this nation, if this nation exists, so do you as tradesmen. Can we exist as tradesmen if we are not a nation? Who is a tradesman? He is a member of the nation, an individual of the nation. So what do we say? We say that we came to this nation not to be masters, but to be servants. I see the Ahis in front of me and I know that the Ahis live with the same spirit of being a servant. I will make the prayer in a little while, we watched in the prayer, the owners of that prayer will never be the masters of this nation. Now we have given our warning to these opportunists, I called on the opportunists to turn back from the wrong path they took and to attract places with prices suitable for reasonable profit levels.
Did we, as the state, make a 10 percent discount on natural gas and electricity prices? We did. Mr. Bendevi just mentioned some discounts on electricity etc. Mr. Bendevi, we have already made a 10 percent discount on electricity and a 10 percent discount on natural gas. Look, he says, 'now let's lower it a little more.' Where does all this electricity come from? These are imported from abroad, these are not produced in this country, they are fuel from abroad. We tried to relieve the burden on our nation by keeping fuel prices as constant as possible by changing tax rates. We provide so much diesel fuel support in agriculture, right?
We did not stop there, we tried to provide relief to the real sector by implementing many support programs. On the other hand, some people insisted on opportunism. We saw that they did not care, so we said, 'Then we will take our own precautions.' We immediately activated our ministries and municipalities and started selling fruits and vegetables to our nation at affordable prices at the regulated sales points we established in our metropolitan cities. We are now planning to expand the same application to areas such as cleaning products and pulses, where there are exorbitant price increases.
Our aim is never to be a rival to our tradesmen and craftsmen or to take away their bread. We only opened this road to teach the opportunists a lesson. When we see that things return to normal and the opportunities that cling to our nation like ticks come to an end, there will no longer be a need for such methods. This is not our job anyway, so we took these steps to get this job done right now. We will continue to support our tradesmen and craftsmen, within the framework of the rules of the free market economy, but who do not abandon morality, decency and conscience, until the end.
Ahi culture, we always talk about it, what does it say? He opens the shop in the morning and says, 'I made my siftah, go to the shop next door, they didn't make your siftah, buy it from them'; We need this, we need this culture. Here I am looking for those ahis. As we say, Ahi culture, Ahi principles, Ahi morality, we saw once again the importance of this in the recent events we experienced. If our tradesmen and craftsmen weed out the bad apples that do not comply with Ahi values ​​and block the opportunities, there would be no need for such interventions by the state.
I underline once again; We do not play with the bread of our tradesmen and artisans, on the contrary, we teach a lesson to those who play with the bread of our nation, that is what we do. Our tradesmen and craftsmen will benefit most from our fight against opportunists. We are talking about chain markets, I know they will be angry with me from here, what did they do? They never lowered the prices despite our calls. But we started this practice, and now chain markets have started to reduce prices. Here you go, this is the job.
As a result of the work we will do now, it will probably be left until after the election, we realized that the system is not fully established, we will sit down and talk about these issues under the leadership of our municipalities, in cooperation with you, and with the new road map, we will take these steps to the farthest corner, hopefully by making the distribution mechanisms even stronger. we will throw it.
Our nation sees who stands by them sincerely and who puts their hand in their pocket when they get the chance. We expect the greatest support from you in our struggle for this. Just as we crushed the heads of terrorist organizations together, we must now teach a lesson to those who try to besiege our country and inflict economic terror. Hopefully, together we will deal a solid Ottoman slap to these economic hitmen. I believe that on March 31, you will not only elect mayors, but also give these opportunists, these enemies of the nation, the lesson they deserve.
My brothers;
Turkey's strength lies in the strength of each and every one of our 82 million citizens. Turkey's growth is possible with the growth of our entire nation, including its industrialists, businessmen, tradesmen, farmers, employees, retirees. Turkey's development can be achieved through the progress of each of our 81 provinces. It is neither right nor sustainable for only one section, only one region, only one province to win. Whatever service we have provided to Turkey for 17 years, whatever work we have produced, whatever project we have implemented, we have ensured that every member of our nation will benefit from it.
No one can say that the standard of living is the same or lower than it was 17 years ago. I am speaking clearly to those who claim this, my brothers; He is a liar, has malicious intentions, and is simply ignorant. Increasing the quality of life, of course, brings with it the expectation of increasing needs and, accordingly, the level of earnings. In other words, having trouble making ends meet today does not mean not having bread to eat, clothes to wear, firewood, roads to go, or work to do, as it used to be. Thank God, all our citizens have these opportunities and services. Look, today there is natural gas in 81 provinces, half of all districts in Turkey have natural gas. Now my citizen and villager in Anatolia can press the button at home and heat every part of his house, we have come this far.
Today's issue is not about finding dry bread, but about setting the table. Today, it is not about having just any dress, but about having the most beautiful dress. Today, the issue is not about finding just any job, but about finding the most comfortable and highest-income job. It is our citizens' right to demand these living standards. It is our duty to provide this to them. Those who write misery literature deceive only themselves, not our nation. We promise not to save our nation from poverty, but to raise them to the living standards of the most advanced countries in the world. Those who cannot even dream of our achievements cannot see this difference. We cannot know where we should go in the future without correctly evaluating where Turkey is today.
Look, I said in a speech recently, 'We are fighting against terrorism with our F16s and Mehmetçiks in Cudi, Gabar, Tendürek, Kandil. I said, 'Do you ever think about the cost of the fuel our planes burn, the bombs they drop, the bullets fired from the gun our Mehmet uses, and all the ammunition used in tanks and cannons?' I said. Those who come to us with potatoes and tomatoes make excuses for us without thinking about these things.
Well, this nation is a member of a culture that shared a bowl of soup with its brother Mehmet in Çanakkale on March 18, 1915 in the history of this state. Believe me, those who come across us with potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, garlic, etc. have rotted them in their stocks. They rotted the onion, they rotted the potato, they rotted the garlic, we caught all of them. There is a female leader who says 'she mixes these things up for bullets'. You are confusing politics and you don't realize it. Let's put these on the table first. If Turkey, which was the 17th country in the world according to purchasing power parity, has risen to 13th today and hopefully will rise to 12th by the end of the year, we need to change our measurements and criteria accordingly.
The Presidential government system is our country's biggest chance for this change. We now have a management system where we quickly identify needs, make decisions quickly and implement them at lightning speed. This opportunity brings great benefits in neutralizing the attacks we are exposed to in a short time.
This is why we have become the most important interlocutor of all actors in the region, having a say in the management of the Syrian crisis. This is the reason why today we can manage to eliminate the effects of economic fluctuations within months, not years.
I know that our nation is tired because of the consecutive elections and referendums we have experienced in recent years. We have had 7 elections or referendums in the last four years. Hopefully, Turkey will have a 4.5-year period of uninterrupted stability and action after the March 31 elections. We want to use this period in the most efficient way to achieve Turkey's 2023 goals and make it stronger in its region and in the world.
In this respect, the support of our tradesmen and craftsmen for March 31st is valuable to us. Until today, we have walked shoulder to shoulder together. I believe that we will walk together again on the path to building the Turkey of the future.

With these feelings, I repeat my words as I offer you my love and respect once again, and I would like to end with some lines from the Ahi or tradesman prayer:
“Keep us away from haram things, do not let others help us, protect us from disobeying your orders, show us the right path. Protect all of us from poverty, lack of fruitfulness, deception and deceit, violation of rights, and violation of people's rights. Protect us from hunger, poverty, famine, drought, land and heavenly calamities. Grant us the ability to be content, to be rich in heart, to be full of eyes, to compete in good deeds, and to be a giving hand. O Allah, if our sustenance is in the sky, bring it down to the earth; if it is underground, it will rise to the sky; if it is far away, bring it closer; if it is difficult, make it easy. Make our sustenance clean and halal. ""Do not make us among those who do evil by following their own desires, and make our deeds good and fruitful."" Amine. Stay healthy.
",2023-03-31,"In the local elections, the Cumhur Alliance formed by the AK Party and MHP received 51.6 percent of the votes.",before
Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2019-02-05,"

First of all, I would like to welcome our brother Tamer Akkal, who joined us today, on this journey, on the path of serving the nation, in this struggle we will fight together; May God help us.
My dear nation,
My dear parliamentary friends,
Dear guests;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection.
I pray to God that our Group Meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country.
There is a very important agenda before our Grand National Assembly of Turkey, which reconvened after a two-week break. We must quickly discuss and implement the priority issues on our agenda until the local elections are recessed.
As in every field, Turkey cannot tolerate delays in its legislative activities. I expect you, on the one hand, to closely follow the work in the constituencies and, on the other hand, to take an active part in the activities of the Parliament. Divide the week into two, I want you to work uninterruptedly for 7 days, half in the Parliament and half in the field. Our Lord says that a person will only be rewarded for what he works for. We will also work hard so that we can achieve our goals.
Of course, some people may have misunderstood this order because they devoted all their strength and time to their own internal conflicts, fights and divisions. The difference between the candidate selection process of other parties and the AK Party's candidate selection process is the biggest indicator of who engages in politics for what purpose. Intra-party competition in the AK Party is a feast of democracy. Sometimes 5 people, sometimes 10 people, sometimes 30 people apply for a position. As a result of detailed studies and consultations, a name is announced as a candidate. From the moment this name is officially announced, everything is left behind, our Party unites around our candidate with all its strength.
Another feature of the AK Party is that it is a party that is with the nation every day, not one that goes to the people from election to election. We strengthen this unity even more and make it more frequent during election periods. The main thing for us is to win the hearts of our nation. When we achieve this, we will win the election anyway. This is the reason why we stood before our nation on March 31 saying ""it's a matter of the country, it's a matter of the heart"". This is the reason why we came before our nation with the People's Alliance on March 31. In this period when our country is going through one of the most critical periods in its history, we are ready to walk together with everyone who comes together around the principle of one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state.
We showed that the field is not empty for those who try to bring Turkey to its knees through the terrorist organizations they nurture and raise within and outside its borders. We also showed those who tried every possible way, from polarizing society to collapsing the economy, where terrorist organizations were not enough, that our country was not the banana republic they thought it was.
After the local elections, we will have an uninterrupted period of approximately 4.5 years of action. We will make the best use of this process, both by using the advantages of the Presidential Government System and with the victory we will achieve in the municipalities with the favor of our nation and God's permission.
With the work we have done in the past 16 years, we have improved our country and brought it to the middle-upper development level. Now, our goal is to take Turkey to the next level by making it among the 10 most developed countries in the world. Hopefully, at the end of this year, we will have raised our country from 13th to 12th according to purchasing parity. In order to achieve the same success in other areas, we need to maintain a strong environment of stability and trust. I wholeheartedly believe that our nation will give us this opportunity once again on March 31. As long as we work hard, enter the hearts of our nation, and expect the reward from our Lord.
Dear friends;
As the AK Party, we completed our preparations for the March 31 elections and went to the field with all our strength. Last Thursday, we announced the manifesto of our 31 March elections together with all our candidates and organization members in Ankara. Thus, we officially started our election campaign. The main idea of ​​our campaign is to enter the hearts of our nation.
So, how do we enter the hearts of our nation? First of all, we will explain that we do not see the future of the AK Party and the future of our country as different. We will express that if our nation exists, we will also exist, if our nation is happy, we will also be happy, and if our nation is sad, we will also be sad. We will impress upon all hearts that if Turkey grows, develops, becomes stronger and richer, we too will find the courage to establish greater states and set greater goals.
In addition, we will protect the AK Party's 16 years of experience, actions and services, and will explain these with examples and figures at every opportunity. In fact, when it comes to municipality, we will start this calendar from 1994. We will express at every opportunity where we took Turkey and our cities from and where we brought them. In addition, we will demonstrate that we aspire to serve our nation with humility, sincerity and effort. In our world, my brothers, our nation watching us on their screens, we will show our nation with our own lives that there is no place for arrogance, arrogance, arrogance, factionalism, factionalism, impudence, theft, corruption, waste, injustice, lawlessness and injustice.
We will express our dreams, plans and projects about the future of our country, our nation and our cities to our nation. We will share with our nation how we will manage municipalities with an understanding of urbanism that suits people and all living things, the environment, history, culture, art, morality and conscience. We explained all these issues under 11 headings in our election manifesto. Et-repeat ahsen velev kane there are a hundred and eighty, so now I will explain it once again. I would like to repeat these 11 headings once again in your presence.
In the coming period, city plans will be prepared in a long-term and equitable manner under the AK Party municipality. These plans will be prepared in a fair and equitable manner, not on someone's orders.
Infrastructure and transportation problems will be radically solved in all our cities. From wastewater channels, drinking water, rain water, to all of these, we will be overhauled over and over again, hopefully we will take a step, a construction.
Urban transformation works will be carried out on a voluntary basis, according to the characteristics of the regions and the needs of our citizens. Not on a ""I did it and that's it"" mentality, but on a voluntary basis. And right now, we have clearly seen and know that our metropolitan cities, Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir, have huge needs at this point, so we need to solve this by joining hands with our people. Now, can we say ""this is a very beautiful place"" about Karabakh in Izmir? Isn't there a need for urban transformation here? Don't my citizens living there have a humane right to live in a modern city? But unfortunately, those who have come this far have enabled this and turned a blind eye to this situation. The same thing applies to our Ankara, the same thing goes to our Istanbul. In our Istanbul, Küçükarmutlu is a disgrace, it is terrible, now we are taking these steps there. And of course, what is becoming more common in such places? Terrorism is becoming widespread, we cannot give them the opportunity. If we take these steps with a modern understanding of urbanism, our citizens will help us by joining hands with us, and hopefully we will make this understanding of urbanization dominant by helping them.
With the understanding of unique cities, our cities will be developed in accordance with their own stories, an understanding of urbanism that is truly compatible with their history.
In addition, smart cities; With smart cities applications, all the possibilities of technology will be put at the disposal of our people and cities. In environmentally friendly cities and municipal services, harmony with all living or non-living beings in nature will be observed.
By attaching importance to social municipalism and these studies, services and projects that directly touch people will be expanded.
Exemplary residential areas that revive family, neighborhood and neighborhood culture integrated with nature through horizontal urbanization will be established. I call out to my nation watching us on their screens right now, I ask for God's sake, do the people living in such buildings with 50 or 60 floors know about each other? Is there such a thing as neighborhood law? Believe me, there is no news of the person next door dying. So, is our history like this? I said it on TV last night, our neighbors across the street from us are Aunt Müşerref and Auntie Suat, they pick me up when I get dirty, because we play in the street, the streets are not like they are today with mud. He takes me, washes me, dresses me and hands me over to my mother. Likewise, my late mother would take their children, wash them, and she would hand them over to them. This was the neighborhood. We had such affection and love for each other, and the same was true between children. But now, is there such a thing as children's rights with each other in these giant residences or these giant buildings and towers? No, they are all monuments of arrogance. There is no such thing as meeting, meeting or talking to each other anyway. That's why we will spread this understanding, especially TOKİ, and with this horizontal urbanization understanding, we will enrich and develop the rights of the people living in all those buildings, and thus this culture will tell us about our history and civilization.
With the principle of management together with the people, all important decisions regarding the city will be taken together with the people living there. Decisions will be taken together with the people, especially the headmen, and the NGOs and non-governmental organizations there. Therefore, all the headmen there, non-governmental organizations will be aware of what is being done and what is being done, and steps will be taken accordingly.
Municipalities' resources will be used both correctly and openly, with sensitivity to savings and transparency. Approaches that will improve the quality of life in all areas, especially in value-producing cities, culture and economy, will be developed. Otherwise, it is such an understanding of profit that the structures that produce value, not by exploiting the coupon areas, but in our AK Party municipalities, which our nation will entrust to its management, will inevitably find their buyers with that inherent value. But this is mainly due to the horizontal architecture, as I said, where specifically what will be at the center? With its place of worship, school, health care, all these for the children, the public cafeteria there, and all these with the public gardens, these places will become value-producing with a structuring that centers on these. We will provide services within the framework of the principles we express under these 11 headings. I already wish that it will be beneficial for our country and cities.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Of course, the process is getting shorter now, we have 55 days, and within 55 days, all our mayoral candidate friends, as well as our friends who will be determined as municipal council members, our deputies, all our organizations, must explain these to our people in detail, once on the street. What will we tell? When municipalism is mentioned, AK Party comes to mind, we will explain this. And we will tell about the spirit of 94, what kind of a revolution we made in municipality in this country in 94, before and after, we will explain these. We will tell you what we did in Istanbul, Ankara, Kayseri, Konya, Malatya, etc., and Erzurum. So, we will talk with our works, we will tell facts, not dreams. So, what will those in front of us say? Either they don't have anything to say about it. That's why we will talk about what we have done. Believe me, our young children and brothers who will vote for the first time, many of them do not know where and what has been done, we need to explain these so that they know, and therefore, let them say that I was looking for such a municipality when they cast their votes, and this is what I found.
My brothers;
On this occasion, I move on to economics. It is obvious how the AK Party governments have achieved success in the economy in every period. And what was the national income per capita when we took office, what is the national income per capita now? When we look at this, we climbed from $ 3500 to $ 11 thousand, now we have a little decline. Today, we know that economic issues are among the main problems of our nation. Especially the exchange rate, interest and inflation fluctuations we experienced in the past months caused serious problems in the daily life of our nation. As it is known, this economic fluctuation is not caused by our country's own internal dynamics or its own realities; Turkey has been exposed to a major attack using economic tools. Thank God, our country neutralized this wave of attacks in a short time, just like the attacks of terrorist organizations.
Youth;
Thank God, our losses in the economy are not loss of life like terrorism, but loss of money. Our ancestors said, ""Let wealth come instead of life."" We have worked, are working, and will work with all our strength to reduce and eliminate the negativities of the economic fluctuation we have been experiencing since August on our nation's daily life.
For example, what have we done since the beginning of the year regarding natural gas and electricity, which raise bills because their prices depend on foreign currency? We went for a 10% discount on Sunday. Isn't this an essential need of every home? Pay attention, do our interlocutors and opponents talk about these? He doesn't speak. What is he talking about? Tomatoes, peppers, etc. in the market. When you look at the expenditure, it is obvious which one is higher, but I will come to them now.
We have already kept fuel prices at a certain level with a special formula that will cover the bill our nation will pay by sacrificing public income. By increasing the minimum wage from 1603 lira to 2020 lira, we achieved a very significant increase of 26 percent. Likewise, we increased the salaries of workers, civil servants and pensions by taking these developments into consideration. As part of the anti-inflation campaign, we tried to increase our nation's purchasing power both through tax reductions and voluntary participation. We have extended the practices we had previously initiated to encourage investment and employment to cover this year and even the following years in some areas.
In addition, we have taken very important steps to establish the income-expenditure balance of the state treasury and to prevent problems similar to the situation we experienced in August.
We recently met with representatives of all chambers and commodity exchanges at the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey. With the speech I gave there, we received commitments from the chambers of industry, chambers of commerce, and stock exchanges in all provinces, and the commitments we received were job opportunities for approximately 2.5 million unemployed people, and we received these promises from them. . Hopefully, by hiring such unemployed people this year, we have provided job opportunities for such unemployed people, and we have taken steps to achieve this.
When we took office in exports, at the beginning of 2003, what were our exports? 36 billion dollars. Where are we now? We reached 168 billion dollars, a historical record. Mr. Kemal, do you know these? Do you have any idea where we came from?
As of January this year, our annual exports increased to 168.8 billion dollars, while our foreign trade deficit decreased to 48.5 billion dollars. Look where the accounts are going. But whose duty is it to talk about, explain and evaluate these? Our friends are ours, Mr. Kemal does not tell about this, those who are with him, those who are elbow to elbow with him, they do not tell about this, especially those who have done business with Kandil do not tell about it. Now who is doing business with those who do business with the terrorist organization in Qandil? CHP is in business, İyi Party is in business, Saadet is in business; look at this situation. Do you know that these are signs of the apocalypse? Where did we come from?
Due to the increase in exchange rates, our national income in 2018 may decrease slightly on paper. However, in the category that measures the national income of countries according to purchasing power parity, independent of foreign exchange, interest and inflation, Turkey will hopefully move up one place this year, from 13th to 12th. Youth; As it is known, we were ranked 17th in this classification in 2002, and hopefully we will have jumped 5 steps in this field as of next year.
Essentially, Turkey's struggle in the field of economy is a national cause, a local cause, not an order. Everyone who feels they are a member of this country and nation should support this struggle. As a matter of fact, regardless of political views, we have seen and continue to see this support from local and national groups. However, CHP and some parties that have now become its satellites could not display the same honorable stance in this great struggle of Turkey. On the contrary, CHP pursued such vile opportunism as to lie that our country would go to the IMF again.
Again, I call out to those who watch us on television, my dear nation, my dear brothers and sisters;
It is clear who went to the IMF, here is the CHP mentality, others, they went to the IMF. When we came to power, Turkey's debt to the IMF was 23.5 billion dollars, and we found this debt to the IMF in our arms. We are a government that, while making huge investments, has also paid off this debt. Turkey closed its IMF book in May 2013 and will not open it again, God willing.
It is a betrayal to Turkey to even mention such a path that will put us back in the position of African, Asian and South American countries. But Mr. Kemal does not have such a problem, he does not understand this. Just as he ruined SSK when he was the General Manager of SSK, God will not give them such an opportunity anyway. And it is clear what the state of those hospitals was, it is clear what that disgrace was, even if you entered there healthy, you would come out crippled, we have seen them, but now the state of our hospitals is obvious, alhamdulillah. And now they are making up such lies that hospitals no longer get up in the morning and do examinations. Be honest, be honest, your lying skills are already at its peak, be honest, maybe you'll catch something, but no, your life is a lie.
As you know, the fines come one after the other, 1.5 million came one, 1 million came one, and they come and come. He couldn't pay it himself, he was collecting it from his relatives, the MPs came together, they formed a union for him, they established a ballot box and now this money is being paid by collecting it in that ballot box. And İş Bankası is on the table, remember that; Gazi Mustafa Kemal allocated İş Bank to the Treasury, not to the CHP, and this İş Bank will, yes, become the property of the Treasury, God willing. This Parliament will take this historic decision, God willing. And İşbank will be transferred to the nation's Treasury, yes, with its 28 percent share there, I believe that. Why? The nation's property and the Treasury's property will go there. Sir, “CHP does not receive money from there”. That's right, you have 4 members in the management, what do they do in that management? Do they just raise and lower their hands? Why they download it, what they do, we know all of this. That's why we will prevent the historical mistake and all the corruption here.
We understand from what he said that if the CHP came to power, the first thing it would do would be to take our country and hand it over to the IMF. When it comes to words, they say that they are leftists and democrats, but now I am telling you something else, they secretly support the attempt to remove the elected President of the country from his post in Venezuela through an international coup. They even want the same situation to happen in our country. Didn't it happen on July 15? On July 15, people are in the squares and airports. Mr. Kemal arrives at Istanbul Atatürk Airport at 23:15, they immediately make an agreement with the coup plotters, they talk, he passes through the tanks and goes straight to Bakırköy Municipality. He follows us there, sipping his coffee, to see what's going on. Maybe they could have taken him too, but with the coup plotters. And at our famous Yenikapı rally on August 7, he was saying no until Friday evening. Whatever happened at the last minute on Friday night, they probably couldn't stand the pressure and said yes. And what happened next? He came, saw such a large participation that he had never seen in his life, and made his speech there that day. But later on, he could not tolerate the enthusiasm, unity and solidarity of that August 7th and started speaking against it. They are like this, there is no nationalism in them, there is no locality in them, there is no such thing as solidarity in them. These are the heirs of the understanding of dividing, fragmenting and swallowing in this country. And that day, together with Mr. Bahçeli, we further developed that unity with the People's Alliance, and hopefully we will continue this process by developing it further. And here we especially need to further strengthen the People's Alliance. That's why I say, I hope we can continue the People's Alliance by strengthening it this way, not until the market, but even until the grave.
My dear brothers, let's teach a very serious lesson to the CHP, which does not hesitate to join arms with everyone who is the enemy of Turkey and the Turkish nation. Frankly, I feel sorry for our people who love the CHP and other parties that are sailing towards the unknown by getting into the same boat with it. I know that those who love these parties see the inconsistencies, inadequacies, and vacillations that sometimes lead to betrayal in the policies of the party administrations. Members of the Iyi Party have definitely seen the praise given to the cruel chief prosecutor of September 12. The bloody terror barons in Qandil do not hesitate to openly express their support for HDP's alliance with CHP and İyi Party. We guess that our pure-hearted citizens who voted for neither the CHP nor the Good Party nor the Saadet Party consented to this disgrace.
The vision of the opposition before us is so barren that it pinned its hopes on onions and potatoes in the last election and on eggplants and peppers in this election. If we manage to explain ourselves to the bases of these parties, I believe that we can win the hearts of everyone who has given up hope on their parties, except for a small marginal segment. Actually, the situation is not as they say, I was with my citizens this weekend in Çengelköy, Istanbul, there is a beautiful place called Çınaraltı and it is a place where our people are extremely busy and interested. That place only makes tea, toast, etc., but everyone comes there with their own pastries, etc., and eats them there. Of course, we sat down, took pictures, had conversations, etc. Thanks to hundreds of people, they came there in large numbers. Of course, I saw that no one was talking about the bazaar or market, everyone was happy there. When I ask what your complaints are, etc., then they spill out a bit. Do you know what they say to me? It's very interesting? The prices of these markets do not match each other, you called them a little, you shouted and called, but shout some more.
Now, we talked about these at the Cabinet Meeting yesterday and I assigned them, especially our Minister of Food and Agriculture, for some measures. Now, of course, we will develop some studies at this point. But I say it again from here: Those, especially the CHP and its allies, who were wringing their hands and waiting for our country to stumble or even fall to the ground after the troubles in August, have been and will be disappointed once again. Why? These middlemen, from the producer to the consumer, are the ones who profiteer. There is not one broker in between, there are 2-3-4-5 brokers. Of course, what do these prices do at each station? It increases, everyone gets their profit from there. By taking many different steps in this business, hopefully, we will strive to take it from the producer state to the consumer, to become a consumer directly, without any other intermediaries in this process, and to reach the public from there, and to deliver it to our citizens at the most affordable price.
When I became the Mayor of Istanbul, I said that the prices of bread were rising so unaccountably, this is not going to happen. What should we do? I said let's quickly establish modern, but huge bread factories. And we established a large bread factory on the Pendik side of Istanbul, on the Anatolian side. Similarly, there was one in Edirnekapı, we modernized it, because unfortunately it was not hygienic, it was terrible, it was a disgrace. We immediately modernized it and established a second one in Cebeci, and also We expanded our buffets. The prices were low, of course, and we started to adjust the market by offering low-priced breads, both in terms of quality and low prices. I'm telling you from now on, look, it was the same thing, peppers, chardonnay, eggplants, tomatoes, whatever you can think of, potatoes, everything, we have decided to adjust these prices if necessary, we will take steps.
Look, let me tell you something now; We may not be able to make it due to limited time. As you know, regulated sales were once established, so we can and will take these steps through our municipalities, because we are obliged to provide cheap, healthy products to our citizens. Türkiye will overcome such a crisis with its own means and capabilities, with God's permission.
All data, especially debt ratios, debt rollover calendar and financial discipline, indicate that our country does not need any external technical support. Hopefully, in 2019, we will completely eliminate the effects of the fluctuation in August and continue our determined march towards our goals.
Dear friends;
The most obvious feature of Turkey's stance in the last 16 years is its stance in favor of what is fair, just and conscientious everywhere and at all times. We stood for justice and justice in Syria, Iraq and Libya. We stood for justice and justice in Palestine and Jerusalem. We stood for justice and justice in Arakan, Turkestan and Crimea. We have always been on the side of justice and justice in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Africa and South America. Thank God, we have the opportunity, courage, unity, solidarity, political, diplomatic, military and economic power to demonstrate this stance. It is because of the richness of our hearts that we are ahead of many countries that have many times more money than us in humanitarian development aid. In the past, even though our hearts were hurting, we did not have the opportunity to say stop to the cruelty that was happening before our eyes. Today, we can display this honorable stance not only with our hearts, but also with our tongue and hands. We also have the power to pay the price for this stance if necessary. From the Turkey that was destroyed by manipulations worth a few billion dollars in the 1990s, we have now a Turkey that simultaneously carries out dozens of projects worth billions of dollars each. Every economic move towards our country has serious costs for both us and those around us. This is the reason why some of the attacks we are exposed to cannot go beyond a certain stage. Of course, behind all these discussions there is a much bigger game, much bigger plans.
We face the signs of a historical transformation in the world and in our region every day. Syria is the most critical place of this great transformation. If the plans in the Syrian field can be implemented, the new targets of this great transformation will come, and it is an undoubted fact that one of them is Turkey. For this reason, we consider the Syrian issue to be a vital one. We have no words for those who are blind or ignorant enough to see the issue as limited to the Syrians in our country. But, seeing this fact, those who try to make Turkey submit to this new imperialist order are deliberately hostile to the country. We can only say shame on those who are so alienated from their country that they do not know that the Syrian cause is Turkey's cause.
Here's what's happening in Venezuela right now; Is Venezuela your state? How can you tell a person who came to power by election to leave this place and go away? And how can you hand over the presidency of that state to someone who has not even participated in the election? You know, democracy, you were a democrat, what is this? Is there such an understanding, is it possible to accept it?
Here is the European Union; The European Union has been revealed for what it is. What about democracy? What is this disgrace? On the one hand, you will say democracy, democracy, democracy, you will say ballot box, ballot box, and then you will overthrow the government by force and fraud.
Youth; Let's know this very well: We do not accept a world where the strong are right, we accept a world where the right is strong, we need to focus on this. And we need to continue our way with this understanding. Because the structure dominated by the powerful is not the structure of our understanding of civilization and we are absolutely against these imperialist structures and it is not possible for us to accept them.
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again the basic parameters of our Syria policy.
Turkey respects Syria's territorial integrity, political integrity and the people's right to determine their own future. For this reason, we sincerely support the process of making a new constitution and free elections.
Until the situation in the country returns to normal, the places in Syria where people live in real safety and peace are the regions under our country's control. As a matter of fact, there are returns from our country to Syria only to places under Turkey's control, and as of now, they have reached 300 thousand. Other regions are under the oppression of either terrorist organizations or a regime that still does not trust its people. The only reason we oppose DAESH and PKK-YPG is that they are terrorist organizations. Apart from this, we are not prejudiced against any group that is the true representative of the Syrian people, and we are in close dialogue with all of them. We sit down and meet with all the legitimate Syrian opposition and try to help them.
Dear friends;
The threat level of terrorists in our country to us is the same as the terrorists in Syria. Because there is a 911 kilometer border between us and this country. No matter what we do, it is not possible to keep this border under control. The only way to ensure our security is to dry up the resources of terrorist organizations and completely destroy their existence in Syria, as in Iraq. That's why we are in Cudi, that's why we are in Gabar, that's why we are in Tendürek, even in Kandil we are and will be. Thus, we will provide our Syrian brothers with a climate where they can live in peace and security. This is the only solution to ensure the permanent return of Syrians to our country.
The east of the Euphrates and Manbij are the most important issues on our Syrian agenda. I reiterate here once again our decision on the safe zone; We cannot accept any offer other than a safe zone model under Turkey's control, with other countries providing only logistical support. While it is obvious that no safe zone established by international powers has been successful or brought lasting peace, we look for intent in imposing the same formula on us. For now, we are waiting for America's promises to us to be fulfilled.
Removing terrorists from Manbij has been an issue that has been talked about for years but no progress has been made. Unfortunately, we see that this issue is still pending. As the Manbij issue remains open, the regime's enthusiasm for this region increases. However, Manbij's need and demand is neither the terrorists under America's protection nor the oppression of the regime. The people of this region want to take care of their own future under Turkey's assurance, and they trust us here, too. They trust us in Jarablus, they trust us in Al Bab, they trust us in Afrin and now other regions, especially Idlib, trust us.
Due to the oppression inflicted by PKK-YPG on the people of the region, none of the Syrians in our country can return to their homes. We aim to bring this place under the control of the local people as soon as possible. In addition to our political and diplomatic struggle, we also continue our military preparations. If America does not keep its promises to us, clear the region of terrorists and contribute to the establishment of a safe zone under Turkey's control, we will cut our own belly.
We have had and continue to have really productive and promising discussions with Mr. Trump on these issues. However, we cannot achieve the same efficiency in lower-level diplomatic and military negotiations. There is no concrete satisfactory plan put before us so far. Of course, we are faithful to our agreements, our word is our word, but our patience is not unlimited. If the terrorists in Manbij are not removed from here within a few weeks, our waiting period will end. Likewise, if the people of the region do not establish their own governance in the east of the Euphrates within a few months with the support of Turkey, our waiting period will end again. In this case, Türkiye will have kept its promises to its interlocutors, but will not have been able to find the reward. In other words, we will have the right to implement our own plans. Resolving the issue through international cooperation is the ideal path for everyone, and we are pushing this path to the end.
The importance of the developments in Syria for the future of our country obliges us to use every means and method. However, when it comes down to it, we are not obliged to ask anyone's permission or answer to anyone for the work we do, this is known. No threat, including a sanctions list, can turn us back from this path. If we do not show this attitude today and do what is necessary, we cannot be accountable to our martyrs, veterans and future generations. Just as today we question and criticize others for the shortcomings and mistakes of the past, we cannot avoid falling into the same situation when we do not do our duty.
Therefore, we will fulfill the commitments we declared to our nation in our Syria policy at all costs. Because all the tribes in the region constantly ask when are you coming? I clearly gave all these instructions to our friends conducting the negotiations.
My dear brothers and sisters;
From now on, there will be no stopping in these remaining 55 days, keep going; May God help us.
With these feelings, I once again wish you success in the work of the Parliament, I offer my love and respect to all of you, stay in good health.

My dear nation,
Dear heads of state and government,
Dear parliament speakers and vice presidents,
Dear country representatives,
Dear friends from home and abroad,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for being with us on this most important day in our country's history.
I would like to thank once again our citizens who deemed us worthy of this position with their votes, prayers and support in the June 24 elections. I also extend my love to all our brothers and sisters in every corner of the world whose hearts beat for our success. I respectfully greet everyone who shared our joy by being here in person or by following us on their screens today.
I pray to God, just like the day I announced my candidacy for my first Presidential post: Endless praise be to God, who has brought us to this day. Lord, keep our feet firm on righteousness in this holy journey we are on. My Lord, expand our chests and make our good deeds easier.
Today, we are preparing for a beautiful journey to serve our Lord and His creations, that is, the public. O Lord, protect us from arrogance. O Lord, protect us from envy. O Lord, keep us free from injustice, injustice and oppression. O Lord; Protect us, our family, and all our companions from the traps of the roads. You are the one who has power over everything.
Our wish on this holy day is that, O Lord, give this nation the good news of victory once again. O Lord, make the blessed journey we embarked on today a blessing for Turkey, our nation, and humanity. Oh God, we ask for help only from you. My Lord, guide us to the right path, the path of those you have blessed. Amen amen amen.
Yes, four years later, I say amen once again with the same feelings. God has given us the blessing, once again we have come to this position with the favor of our nation. Moreover, this time we came to the Presidency with all the powers of the executive branch as required by the changing management system. May God not embarrass us to our nation. May God enlighten our path and make our work easier in our services to our nation and all humanity.
My dear nation, dear friends;
We have been in politics for more than 40 years. We have always done politics for the sake of God and to serve our nation. We came not to be lords, but especially to be servants to the nation. We worked day and night to be worthy of the nation we aspired to serve. Thank God, our nation has never left us alone or abandoned us. On June 24, he chose us to serve him once again. We will try to be worthy of our nation, with the awareness that we are the President of not only those who voted for us, but all 81 million people.
As the poet said;
“At the end of all good books,
All days,
After all the nights
My breeze blows from you,
whose breath is in you
“There is a new beginning.”
We, as Turkey, as the Turkish nation, are making a new beginning here today, in your presence.
With the presidential system of government, we are moving to a new management model that is far beyond our nearly 150-year quest for democracy and the trials we have experienced throughout our 95-year Republic history. We are now leaving behind a system that made our country pay huge costs due to the political, social and economic chaos it caused in the past. From now on, the President, to whom the nation has direct authority and therefore has the right to hold him to account, will carry out his work in harmony with the legislative and judicial bodies.
I am a politician who has experienced all kinds of troubles, from tutelage to coups, from terrorist attacks to economic traps, starting from my time as mayor and throughout my duties as prime minister and president. In addition to the experiences of our history of democracy, the difficulties we have encountered while expanding our country 3.5 times in the last 16 years have shown us that this change is inevitable.
The presidential system of government is not a compulsion, but an accurate choice guided by history. For the first time in its history since the Ottoman Empire, Turkey has made its choice at a critical crossroads not through a coup or similar coercion, but through the free will of our nation.
On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to our nation, who has been with us in every struggle we have entered, and who protected their independence and future at the expense of their lives, especially in the July 15 coup attempt, the second anniversary of which we will reach on Sunday. Likewise, I would like to wholeheartedly thank every member of my nation who supported this historical reform by accepting the constitutional amendment made in the Parliament in the April 16 referendum immediately after the coup.
My dear nation, precious friends;
The great Islamic thinker Ibn Khaldun says 'geography is destiny'. Our 16 states, represented on our Presidential flag, were founded, grew and became history in a very wide geography. In other words, the Republic of Turkey represents a state tradition of more than 2200 years. Today, there are many friendly and sister states in a very wide geography, almost all of whose representatives are among us, and whom we do not see as separate from ourselves in terms of historical continuity.
As the Republic of Turkey and its citizens, we have placed Anatolia at the center of our destiny. The seeds we sowed in Anatolia in Manzikert a thousand years ago immediately blossomed with the Turkish Seljuk State. With the conquest of Istanbul, the Ottoman Empire transformed the state flag, which it inherited as a young sapling, into a grand plane tree encompassing 3 continents and 7 climates. We rejuvenated the aging plane tree at the beginning of the last century with the Republic vaccine. Today, we promise our nation to rejuvenate our 95-year-old Republic with a new management approach. By making the best use of this opportunity provided to us by our nation, we are setting out for a strong Parliament, a strong government and a strong Turkey.
At a time when our country was exposed to the most intense attacks by terrorist organizations with different names, similar atrocities, and the same goals, we gave our answer to this scenario with our Rabia: We said one nation, we said one flag, we said one homeland, we said one state. Thank God, we have seen that our nation firmly adheres to these 4 principles with us. As a nation, we became united, we became big, we became alive, we became brothers, we became Turkey together, and thus we overcame all the obstacles and broke all the traps.
Our nation once again fulfilled its duty at the ballot box on June 24. From now on, our duty is to work, but work hard, to regain the time we lost for the revival and construction of our civilization. Now is the time to walk more determinedly and faster towards our goals. The first test of our new beginning, which we took today by saying 'Bismillah', will be to achieve our 2023 goals. Thus, we aim to leave a Turkey strong enough to realize their own visions for the next generations.
We are a nation that believes in the fruitfulness of sharing, and is happy to walk the road with our friends and brothers and win together with them. We think that this approach is much more meaningful and valuable today, when the world is in a process of restructuring in every sense. We believe that no country or society needs a guardian, guardian, governess or savior, and that the only thing humanity needs is justice and cooperation.
In the new era, Turkey will move forward in every field, from democracy to fundamental rights and freedoms, from economy to large investments. Turkey, strengthened in this way, will continue to share the opportunities it has with its own citizens and all its friends and brothers. As we always say, our hearts have no boundaries. This view here today is the most concrete example of the breadth of our hearts. I thank you once again for your friendship and brotherhood.
My dear nation, valued guests;
Tonight, we are starting our actions in accordance with the architecture of our new management system by announcing our cabinet. Tomorrow, in accordance with our state tradition, we will first pay our first visits to Azerbaijan and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and on Wednesday we will go to Brussels for the NATO Summit. We will hold the first meeting of our cabinet following the Friday prayer at Hacıbayram Mosque on Friday. The new era is the reform that has become our trademark, and we will hopefully take the steps of renewal with these reforms together with our cabinet. We will move forward by constantly improving our new management system, the framework of which we have created.
We have built a state structure that produces services, not bureaucracy. Our guide will again be democracy and the superiority of national will. We will ensure that all of our citizens benefit from all kinds of rights and freedoms and all the riches of our country, regardless of origin, belief, disposition, region or city. Hopefully, the times in this country when people were excluded, marginalized, and subjected to oppression for any reason are behind us, never to return.
Our greatest wealth is our people. We will take every step necessary to use our human resources, which amaze everyone with their hard work and productivity, more effectively through training and encouragement. One of our most important priorities will be to raise generations who know where they come from, where they stand and where they want to go, with the strong bridge we will build from the past to the present.
We will attach much more importance to our education and cultural policies than in previous periods. We will strengthen Turkey in all areas, from defense industry to border security. In order to make our country one of the 10 largest economies in the world, we will make great moves in every field, from macroeconomic balances to investments. The projects we have completed to date are our biggest reference. We will not only realize our ongoing investments and the projects we have committed to our nation, but also undertake much greater works.
Social policies are our invisible victory. We have come a long way to make Turkey a country where no one is left hungry or stranded due to poverty, where no one neglects their children's education or loses hope for their future. Hopefully, we will make the social state quality of our country much stronger in the new period. We will strive to grow and strengthen Turkey in all other areas, in accordance with the promises we made to our nation.
Once again, I hope our new management system will be beneficial. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank each and every one of you for your participation in our Presidential Inauguration Ceremony. I would especially like to express my gratitude to all our guests who came from abroad to share this beautiful day with us.
Due to the tragic train accident that occurred near Çorlu district of Tekirdağ last evening, we canceled the celebration parts of our ceremony such as folk dances, laser and light shows. I pray God's mercy to my brothers who died in this accident. I pray to God for healing to my injured brothers and sisters, I offer my condolences to all their relatives, and my condolences to our nation.
May God help us. Stay healthy.

My dear nation,
My dear nation watching us on their screens,
Dear Ankara residents,
My dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings and affection.
Actually, I was going to be with you a little earlier; However, in a tragic accident at the Presidential Residence in Istanbul, one of our little children was seriously injured. I chatted with the doctors until he had the surgery at the hospital, and I got together with the family, and then we got their permission and returned to Ankara. Necessary interventions are being carried out, they are currently in surgery. I also ask for your prayers so that the Lord will treat this child of ours with the honorable name Shafi.
I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your enthusiasm, your affection, your affection, your affection, your support, your brotherhood, and the welcoming ceremony of thousands of my brothers and sisters along the way from the airport to here.
You were with us in the November 3, 2002 elections and brought us to power. You didn't stop, you said 'no stopping, keep going'. You said, 'This song does not end here'. You were with us in the elections of July 22, 2007, we fought together against tutelage. You were with us in the elections of June 12, 2011, we brought our country to a new era together. You were with us during the Gezi events, the 17-25 December police-judiciary coup attempt, and the Presidential election. We resisted vandals and treacherous gangs together. You were with us in the 2015 elections, especially on November 1, and together we taught a lesson to those who were wringing their hands and waiting for Turkey to kneel.
You were here during the July 15 coup attempt, there were those who wanted to bomb and occupy our Headquarters. You were around the Presidential Complex, you were here, you were at the Parliament Junction, you were in front of the Ankara Police Station, you were in Kahraman Kazan, you were in Gölbaşı, in short, you were against every coup plotter wherever there was. Together, we narrowed the streets for the FETO treason gang and those who acted together with them. Together, we saved our country, our flag, our call to prayer, our freedom and our honor from the clutches of the coup plotters. Where did they run to? To America. Now I look at the measure, I look at the votes in America; In the votes there, yes, there were a lot of votes for the main opposition. If Aleppo is there, the cubit is in the ballot box. You were on our side again with your will at the ballot box in the April 16 referendum.
Today, you were with us again in the June 24 elections, which will be decisive for the next half century and 1 century of our country. I pray to God that the June 24 election results will be beneficial for our country and nation.
My brothers;
The winner of this election is democracy, the national will, our nation itself. The winner of this election; It is every individual of our 81 million citizens. I would like to thank all my citizens who went to the polls and participated in this feast of democracy in the free election with the highest participation in Turkish political history. You are making history, centuries will remember you very differently.
In many parts of the world, especially in developed countries, elections are held with participation rates that are not even half of ours. The Turkish nation has demonstrated once again in this election how much it attaches importance to democracy and its rights and freedoms, which are an integral part of it, by defending its will that was manifested at the ballot box. This nation, which yesterday stopped the coup plotters' tanks, cannons, planes, helicopters and weapons with its bare hands, has today claimed its independence and future with the same hands. Turkey will end the night of June 24 looking at its future with much more confidence than it did this morning.
The President of the Supreme Electoral Council has just announced that, yes, the winner of this election is Erdoğan with an absolute majority. As you know, the difference between us and our best friend is over 20 points, 22 points. I would like to express my gratitude to all my brothers and my nation who trust me, my alliance and my party.
I would like to thank Mr. Bahçeli, the Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, another wing of the People's Alliance, and all members of the MHP. Likewise, I would like to thank those who purchased the heirlooms of the late Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu. I would like to thank every citizen who exercises their democratic right by going to the polls, regardless of which party they voted for.
In this election, Türkiye experienced many innovations as well as party alliances. As can be seen, this has been a beneficial experience for both the parties and our country. I would like to especially thank all members of our AK Party, from the Headquarters to the ballot box observers, who worked for both our Presidential candidacy and our parliamentary candidates during the elections. Because you didn't say night or day, you ran, you ran, you worked, you struggled.
I would like to state this clearly: We also received the message that our nation gave to our party at the ballot box. Be sure that we will face our nation in the coming period by completing all these shortcomings. We founded the AK Party with our nation, and we brought it to this day with our nation. After today, we will again have our eyes and ears on our nation. As of tomorrow, we are starting to rush to fulfill the promises we made to our nation.
We have largely completed our preparations for our new management system. You probably heard and followed it on television. We will review and complete these works until the Parliament convenes and takes our Presidential oath.
My brothers;
Immediately after the oath ceremony, we will determine our ministers and bureaucrats and start implementing our program. We will work day and night with the awareness that Turkey does not have a single moment to lose. Türkiye has passed another democracy test and set an example for the whole world.
Our nation voted for service, not fight, as it has for 16 years. The winner was our democracy, the winner was the politics of service. The winner was the superiority of the national will, the winner was Türkiye, the winner was the Turkish nation. The winners were all the victims in our region, the winners were all the oppressed people in the world. I thank our Lord for showing us these days. I praise our Lord for not making us ashamed of our nation. I praise our Lord who does not embarrass us to our brothers who follow our country with their hearts and eyes.
We will try harder to be worthy of your love. We will work harder to reciprocate your trust. We will fight harder to do justice to your support. With the power you gave us at the ballot box, we will hopefully reach our country's 2023 goals together.
We will go against terrorist organizations much more decisively. We will raise our country's reputation in the international arena even higher. I hope our flag will fly much more coyly. Our adhans will be recited with much more awe. We will further the peace and welfare of each of our citizens. We will express our Rabia with a much louder voice. Are we ready? One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state. For this reason, we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will all be brothers and together we will be Turkey.
My brothers;
Turkey chose to protect its democracy, rights and freedoms, and continue its reforms. Turkey has made its choice in favor of growth, development, development, investment, enrichment, and being a respected, honorable and influential country in the world in every field. Türkiye has chosen 2023 targets and 2053 and 2071 visions. Turkey has chosen to fight decisively against all terrorist organizations from PKK to FETO.
These results are also an expression that we will continue to liberate Syrian lands and open the way for our guest brothers in our country to return home safely. These results are also an expression that Turkey will continue to hold the hands of all the oppressed and victimized wherever they are in the world. These results are also an expression, my dear brothers and sisters, that we will stand tall against everyone, from terrorist organizations to global interest circles that have an evil eye on our country. These results also indicate that we are one step closer to our goals in democracy and economy.
Our nation has sent so many different messages to so many circles with these election results that even if all the political scientists of the world came together and worked for years, they would still be able to solve this problem. I always say that I cannot be proud enough to be a member and a child of such a nation and I cannot praise my Lord enough.
I thank you once again for this beautiful view. I pray to God that the election results will be beneficial to our democracy, our country and our nation. I greet you with love and respect. Stay in good health, may God help us, may we be entrusted to God.

Their Speech at the 6th UETD General Assembly,2018-05-20,"

My dear brother Mr. Bakir Izetbegovic, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Dear Madam,
Dear ministers,
Dear President and executives of the Union of European Turkish Democrats,
My dear brothers and sisters living in Europe,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. May Allah's peace, mercy and blessings be upon all of you, assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.
I brought you the greetings of our 81 provinces and 81 million citizens. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your love, enthusiasm and appreciation.
I pray to God that the 6th Ordinary Assembly of the Union of European Turkish Democrats UETD will be beneficial. I would like to express my gratitude to all our brothers and sisters who have served our citizens in Europe under this roof at UETD since its establishment. I wish success from Almighty God to our friends who will take part in our congress.
At a time when the glorious European countries, which claim to be the cradle of democracy, have failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown us that it is democratic in essence, not in words, by providing us with the opportunity to come together here. True friendship, true brotherhood, true comradeship are evident these days. With this step they have taken, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven that our centuries-old brotherhood still continues and will continue in the future.
The day before that wise man passed away, I came here on an extraordinary journey and visited him in the hospital. And he had an advice: ""This land is the Son of the Conqueror,"" he said. And he said, ""My son Tayyip, take care of this place."" We never thought of Bosnia separately, we continued on this path together with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will continue.
My brothers;
Europe is not a new place for us, our ancestors have been Europeans for a thousand years. The first thing our ancestors did when they came to Anatolia was to cross the Bosphorus and move towards the interior of Europe. In particular, the Ottoman Empire's direction has always been Europe, except for force majeure. Even though we retreated to Thrace after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, we always maintained our relations with Europe.
This time, we traveled to Europe as expats to meet the labor force needs of European countries that suffered huge human losses in the Second World War. More than 65 years have passed since we went to Europe for employment purposes. In addition to those who went to work, there was also a tendency towards Europe due to the coups and oppression in our country. The first generation, who went to Europe as a young man, took his family with him over time, and their children were born there, and then they had children. The first generation began to give way to the second generation, the third generation, and even the fourth generation.
The first arrivals especially dreamed of working for a while and building a future for themselves in Turkey with the earnings they earned, for this reason we called them 'expatriates', because they would return one day. Of course, some people came, but a significant number also settled in Europe. That's why we no longer call our brothers living on this continent 'expatriates', but Europeans. Europe, which was a 'bitter homeland' yesterday, has now become a new homeland.
Our ancestors, who came from Central Asia a thousand years ago and made Anatolia their homeland, did not stop there; they fixed one foot on Anatolia and spread over a wide geography from Europe to North Africa with the other foot. Today, more than 6 million of our brothers who left Anatolia live in Europe. It is estimated that the number of people of Turkish origin living in North Africa and the Middle East is over 20 million. We know that in many places from Western Thrace to Eastern Europe, our brothers whom we left a century ago are still living their lives.
We have experienced many things since those days when we crossed the Danube 'cheerfully like children'. We have suffered great losses, especially in the last 2 centuries, but even what remains is a great treasure in itself. We are determined to protect this treasure, a part of which is created by you. Even though some people do their best to separate us, I emphasize that they will not succeed.
My brothers;
As you know, after the establishment of the Republic, during the single-party CHP period, there were attempts to sever ties with our nation's history. In the textbooks of our childhood, we learned about the civilizations that lived thousands of years ago in Anatolia, and then suddenly we came to the 20th century, and the thousand-year period in between was almost ignored. Even Seljuk and Ottoman topics in history lessons were explained to us as if they were a trivial topic. We destroyed this understanding that ignored thousands of years of accumulation of our civilization and history. We reunited our nation with its past, culture and values.
One of the issues we attach great importance to is you, the European Turks. I would like to reiterate here once again the following points that I have expressed in every meeting with you: Be sure to obtain the citizenship of the countries you live in, do not say you will not get it, take it if they offer it. There is no problem in countries that allow dual citizenship. We have developed formulas that allow you to use your rights in Turkey without any loss, including a blue card for countries that have different practices in this regard.
My brothers;
Protect your religion and language very well; when you lose them, you will be lost. In addition to teaching your children their native language in the best way, try to ensure that they receive the best education in the country they live in. A person who does not know Turkish well cannot learn, speak or use German well, French well, English well, in short, other languages. Of course, in the meantime, we cannot put Bosnian aside.
We established an organization called the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities, exclusively to respond to the questions of our citizens living abroad. We have facilitated our citizens' access to their state by increasing the number of our embassies and consulates around the world. 19 years ago, we had 12 embassies around the world, thank God, now this number has increased to 41, hopefully there will be no country left where we do not have an embassy. We have radically changed the working approach in our embassies and consulates in line with the transformation in the management mentality of the state in Turkey.
By using the possibilities of technology, we ensured that our citizens abroad could carry out their transactions electronically as much as possible. In order for you to easily exercise your right to vote, which is the most basic element of democracy, we have established ballot boxes in our foreign representative offices as well as at customs. Now they are talking; Those before us, why didn't you do it, why didn't you succeed? We came and solved this, but we were defending the democratic rights of our nation, that's why. I hope you will benefit from this application for the 5th time on June 24th. We are developing and establishing this system in the light of the experiences we have gained in each election. We have facilitated, simplified and reduced the costs of many transactions, from military service to title deed, from passport fees to diploma. We have always supported the activities of our citizens living in Europe under the umbrella of non-governmental organizations, and UETD has made great efforts in this regard.
We have provided convenience for our children in every field, from university entrance to accommodation, whether in their countries of residence or in our own country. Currently, 4 thousand of our children who completed their education abroad are studying at state universities in our country. Again, we brought thousands of our children abroad to our country through the programs we organized, so that they could see their history, culture and civilization closely. We have eliminated an important problem by increasing the time period for our citizens who come to Turkey with their vehicles from the countries they live to use them within our borders to 2 years. Apart from these, we serve our citizens in many other areas. Of course, there are deficiencies and disruptions, and we will resolve them quickly.
My brothers;
Now, I would like to share with you the good news about the new services we will provide to our citizens in the diaspora: We are diversifying our project supports so that our children abroad can learn our native language, Turkish. In this context, we will encourage our children to learn their native language, Turkish, and our culture through weekend schools. We are doubling the quotas at universities allocated to our youth in the diaspora.
Another important work of ours is the steps we will take to simplify public services for our citizens abroad. For example, a few weeks ago, our citizens will be able to pay all fees related to consular transactions directly at the consulates general with a bank card. With this application, we eliminate the bank and prevent our citizens from paying unnecessary commissions.
Applications have started to be received regarding the recognition of divorce decisions through the process to be carried out by our consulates general, without the need for another place. The period of filing a lawsuit again in Turkey, waiting for years and paying thousands of euros is now over. We not only reduced military service from 6 thousand euros to 1 thousand euros in foreign currency; We will soon solve the problems of those who are over 38 years old but cannot apply for military service with foreign currency.
We are establishing a coordination board for foreign citizens in order to make the coordination of services carried out by our different institutions much more effective and faster. We will establish an advisory council for foreign citizens in the consular regions, the secretariat of which will be run by our Presidency for Turks Abroad. In the new term, we will recommend the establishment of a permanent commission called the Foreign Commission within the Turkish Grand National Assembly. In order to strengthen local Turkish media abroad, we will pave the way for the Press Advertisement Agency to place announcements and advertisements in Turkish media abroad. This will be done in accordance with the protection of personal data, national and international law, and most importantly, the interests of our citizens.
My dear brothers and sisters;
With all this said, no one should worry or fall for the dirty propaganda on this subject. TRT Türk will be restructured and provide broader services to our citizens abroad. Another important good news is that our citizens who retire from abroad can work part-time in our country. Immediately after the elections, we are starting to take the steps you expect in this regard. As you can see, the Republic of Turkey is on your side with its President, ministries, embassies, consulates and all its institutions. Wherever in the world a citizen is in trouble, it is our duty to be there with all our resources.
My brothers;
Strength comes from unity. The more European Turks are united among themselves, the stronger they become. The reason why communities much smaller than our citizens are more active in everything from politics to economy, from civil society to cultural studies, is due to the unity and solidarity among them. If some European countries today can display rude attitudes towards us and our country, the reason for this is the disorganization of the Turks there, please know this. They deliberately divide us by calling us Turks, Kurds, Circassians, Sunnis or Alevis so that we cannot reveal our true power. They not only divide us, they pit us against each other.
When we go to European countries, we encounter crowds with Turkish flags on one side of the pavement and organization rags on the other side. But despite all this, I gave a speech at Chatham House in England last week and the interesting situation at the time of my speech is this: There was a sister from the Black Sea region with a Turkish Flag in her hand, PKK terrorists tried to take the Turkish Flag from her hand, but she is my sister, she is my sister. Nene Hatun became that Şerife Sister and did not lose the Turkish Flag to that scoundrel and dishonorably. These scoundrels can't even afford our sisters, let alone dealing with men. We must realize the tricks of those who put us in this situation and put an end to it.
It is time for everyone who came from Turkey to unite around common values, regardless of their origin, sect, disposition or political preference. This unity is for the benefit of everyone, it is in everyone's interest. Be sure that those who easily violate our rights and laws by keeping us in small groups will behave very differently when they see a Turkish society with one heart and one body. The fact that people of Turkish origin show the greatest hostility towards our country in the parliaments of European states shows how far the trap set against us has reached. I hope we will defeat this game together.
My request to you is to take an active role in the political parties in the countries you live in. You should be in those parliaments, not those who betrayed our country. Turkish society has this power, as long as we do not use the small differences between us as an obstacle to achieving big goals. When we act in accordance with the command of our Prophet (PBUH) ""There is mercy in unity, there is torment in separation"", we will see that our path will open up automatically.
I am calling out to all our brothers and sisters in Europe, now is the time to be fully alive. Are we ready to become one? Are we ready to be big? Are we ready to be alive? Are we ready to be brothers?) Are we ready to reach the place we deserve in Europe together? My brothers; What does Aşık Veysel say?
“Allah is one, the Prophet is true
Absolutely the Lord belongs to the world,
Let go of what is you and me,
Let me tell you, it's time
Neither Kurd nor Turk nor Circassian
Adam's son, daughter,
Together, martyrs, veterans,
Is there anything wrong and where?”
Yes, we will embrace and say goodbye to all our brothers and sisters, with whom we became martyrs and veterans yesterday, hopefully in Europe as well as in our country, and we will begin to walk towards common goals. Here is what my brother Bakir just stated: We fought together with our Bosnian brothers in Çanakkale, we lost martyrs there together. This is the point, it is very important to catch this again and become Fatihan's son.
My brothers;
Turkey is preparing for a historic election on June 24, and Bosnia is preparing for a historic election on December 7. On June 24, we will not only elect a president and a member of parliament, but we will also make the choice for the next century of our country.
As AK Party Chairman, Prime Minister and President, you are the closest witnesses to what we have experienced and done in the past 16 years. Sometimes it can be difficult for us to grasp the true dimensions of the events we live in. I believe that you have the opportunity to see and evaluate what is happening in our country more easily from abroad. Because you know much better what changes in Turkey every time you come. Even though some presidential candidates do not know what is going on in Turkey, I give them you as their address.
Because a beautiful word is polite, ""be the ones who are in the sea, but they don't know the sea."" Now, these presidential candidates living in our country are like fish in the sea, they do not understand. Only when you take them from the sea and throw them on land will they understand the value of the sea. Was there Marmaray yesterday? Was there Eurasia yesterday? Was there Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge yesterday? Was there Osman Gazi Bridge yesterday? All of these are huge investments that have just been made and we will continue to do so. And in Turkey, which has 25 airports, thank God, we have now added 29 more. There are now 54 airports. Now, my brothers from different parts of Europe board immediately and when they land in their city, they go home half an hour away from there. Why? That's what modern Türkiye is for.
Every incident that our country has experienced, especially in the last 5 years, is full of exemplary evidence for eyes that see, ears that hear, tongues that speak the truth, and hearts with conscience. We all went through a process together that started with the Gezi events, continued with the 17-25 December police-judiciary coup attempt, turned bloody with terrorist incidents, and betrayal was revealed in all its nakedness with the 15 July coup attempt. This was such a period that there were moments when we had difficulty explaining the truth to those closest to us, even to our friends with whom we had walked together for years.
Our nation was the one who saw the trap set against our country best, I believe you are aware of this. Those who appeared to be aimed at us but actually aimed to bring our nation and our state to its knees, especially our independence and future, were successful in these attacks, yes, with the upright stance of our nation. Türkiye is fighting a second War of Establishment with its struggle in this period. What did we do in the War of Independence? Let's put it in Mehmet Akif's concise words:
“If the west is surrounded by a steel armored wall;
I have borders like my chest full of faith.
Nation, do not be afraid! How can he strangle such faith?
'Civilization!' You mean a monster with only one tooth left?
Friend! Do not let the scoundrels enter my country;
Barricade your body, let alone this indecent flock.
The days that God promised you will arise...
Who knows, maybe tomorrow, maybe the near future.""
Yes, we too, relying on our faith-filled borders, shielded our bodies to prevent scoundrels from invading our country. First, we stopped the coup plotters, terrorists and their secret and open supporters. Then, we destroyed the terror corridor that was tried to be created along the southern borders of our country with Operations Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch. Hopefully, we will continue to move forward determinedly on this path that we have opened with new gains soon. We cannot stop until we destroy the last terrorist pointing a gun at our country, this is known.
My brothers,
Of course, we not only fought against terrorist organizations and the forces behind them, but also took steps to provide our country with a new management system that can cope with its current problems more easily and look to its future with confidence. We are putting the new management system, which was decided upon with the constitutional amendment accepted by our nation in the April 16 referendum, into full effect after the June 24 elections. As we want to move Turkey forward, some people are constantly trying to stop it or even push it back. Since they knew that they could not achieve this alone, they even gave up their political privacy and went so far as to share everything from their MPs to their voters.
People who would not greet each other if they met on the road under normal circumstances joined hands and arms and stood in front of us. As for us, we are walking only and only with our nation today, as we have always done for 16 years. We see continuing this journey together with everyone, local and national, as a requirement of our responsibility towards our nation. That's why we established the people's alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party, and the Great Unity Party also joined us, and this is how the people's alliance entered the elections. Our doors are open to everyone, local and national.
As European Turks, you supported us by far in the Presidential election, the November 1 elections, and the April 16 referendum. Now we need your support once again for the June 24 elections. Now I'm asking you, give an answer that will be heard from all over Europe, from Germany to France, from Belgium to Austria and the Netherlands, to the evil alliance established to drag Turkey into chaos, uncertainty and instability again. Are you ready to walk with us on June 24 against
Are you ready to elect us to the presidency with a record number of votes in the presidential election and our deputies to the overwhelming majority in the Parliament?
Are you ready to strongly implement the Presidential government system and help Turkey achieve its 2023 goals? Are you ready to protect your independence and future? Are you ready to give terrorist organizations and their local and foreign collaborators a solid Ottoman slap? Are you ready to show the power of European Turks to the whole world?
Mashallah, this voice rising from Sarajevo heralds our victory on June 24th. I know you are very tired, you can get up if you want. You know our Rabia, right? One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state... May God not deprive us of these. May God bless you all. Good luck and good luck to you. May He protect us all from accidents and troubles.
Once again, I wish the 6th Ordinary Assembly of UETD to be beneficial. I especially ask you to convey my greetings, respect and affection to all our brothers and sisters wherever you go. I wish you good health and I entrust you to God.

Speech at the Mass Opening Ceremony of 250 Restoration Works,2018-05-08,"

Very valuable guests,
Dear representatives of our foundations,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with all my heartfelt feelings, love and respect. I am very pleased to host you at the Presidential Complex, in this veteran place, on the occasion of this meaningful ceremony. I congratulate your Foundation Week, which is organized between 7-12 May with the theme of 'Women who establish foundations', and I pray to God that it will be beneficial. I hope that the events to be held this week will contribute to a better understanding and survival of our strong foundation tradition, especially the foundations established by our women.
The foundations established by our women in the fields of education, health, religion and culture bring life to the lands where Muslims have set foot for centuries. Thousands of works, from Divriği Ulu Mosque to Mardin Hatuniye Madrasa, from Melike Hatun Mosque in Ankara to Gevher Nesibe Hospital in Kayseri, from Hürrem Almshouse in Jerusalem to Gülnuş Emetullah Mosque, fountain and hospital in Mecca, Medina and Egypt. It still serves humanity in all corners of our geography. On this occasion, I would like to thank all the foundation owners who have adopted the principle of 'hayrun nas men yenfeun nas' as their motto and strived in this direction, who established foundations by following the commandment 'the best of people is the most useful to others', who did charity and left behind works that are beneficial to humanity, and I hope for the world of perpetuity. I pray to God to have mercy on those who died.
Of course, it is also important to establish a foundation, build works, keep them alive, and hand them over to future generations in the best possible way. The original foundation owner has the right over us, the users. Every foundation deed is also a trust entrusted to us. Protecting the trust is a requirement of our faith and belief. In this respect, it is essential for all of us to take care of the foundation works, protect them and, of course, use them in accordance with the foundation deeds.
However, we see that we have not been given a very good test in this regard until recently. Unfortunately, our country has witnessed great negligence and even negligence in the protection of foundation works for a period of time. Especially the single-party CHP era has a long record on this issue. During these unfortunate years of Turkey, many foundation works were plundered, usurped and left to their fate. This mentality, which is at odds with the history, culture and ancient values ​​of the nation, has also betrayed the legacy of our ancestors. Hundreds of mosques that have stood the test of time have been sold, rented or used as museums, warehouses and stables. Some authors state that the number of mosques closed during this period was much higher than recorded.
The main reason underlying this culture of resentment towards the heritage of our ancestors, especially the works of the foundation, is ideological bigotry. As a result of this bigotry, our cultural household, which has been around for thousands of years during the single-party era, has been labeled as an 'example of backwardness'. The same circles believed that this heritage, the value of which they could not appreciate, ""must be subjected to a definitive liquidation"". Those who see the Arabic call to prayer as a sign of bigotry and therefore have kept it from our skies for 18 years have also put the mosques up for sale under the excuse of surplus.
Unfortunately, the Ottoman archives, which were sold to Bulgaria for 3 kuruş each, also had their share of this sales frenzy. The so-called scrap papers, most of which consist of valuable archive documents, constitute the rarest and most valuable works of the Sofia Library today. This is the CHP mentality; There is no such thing as history, art and culture for them, to protect them. Those papers, whose value was scrapped in the name of modernity, are now revered as documents that shed light on Ottoman history.
We also come across ancestral heirlooms plundered from our country in many European countries. Believe me, our hearts break when we see how the works entrusted to us by our ancestors are destroyed. Our sadness increases even more as we witness the care shown by countries whose history is too short to be compared to our country's, to their 50-100 year old works. Our travels abroad show us, among other things, the extent of the damage caused by the one-party mentality to our country. We better understand the damage caused to our national structure by this understanding, which aims to take revenge on history and transform the nation by force and oppression. Thanks to these travels, we see better what a huge wreckage the single-party dictatorship has left in culture, education, politics, social and human areas.
My brothers;
In this period when the world is increasingly exposed to cultural barrenness, only societies with an accumulation of civilization from the past and a vision of civilization for the future can preserve their originality. Those who cannot achieve this will be lost among human communities numbering billions. We are a nation that has an ancient civilization and has not lost our strong vision of civilization. Of course, we are aware of the severe damage caused by the media, communication, internet and popular culture, but we are still hopeful. Because the treasure we have is so big and so voluminous that, as I just stated, it is still enough to keep us afloat despite all the looting and all the destruction.
The solution for the defense and revival of our civilization is not to fight against technology, but to use the possibilities of technology. We record all the material assets of our civilization, from our archives to our libraries, from our museums to our local values, with the help of technology and present them to everyone. Academic and popular studies on our history and culture are increasing. We see that there is a competition on this issue in all media, from television series to movies, from novels to computer games. We witness that the impact of our traditional arts is increasingly felt in many areas, from architecture to clothing.
Despite this, we still have a very important deficiency, and this is the difficulty we have experienced in creating the curriculum of our education system in a way that provides awareness of civilization, history and culture. While other societies, other states create legends from their non-existent history and gather their children around them, we cannot use our existing treasures. Hopefully, one of our biggest goals in the new period is to establish our education system, with both its content and physical infrastructure, that will instill such an awareness in our children. In this regard, there are many steps we need to take in every aspect, from the furnishing of our schools to the quality of our teachers.
Likewise, we have to quickly overcome our infertility in transforming our culture and arts policies into the locomotive of our vision of civilization. The place where a culture and art climate that fosters hostility towards its own country, its own society, its own history, its own civilization, let alone support and pioneering, will take us is submission to global popular culture. Local and national understanding should be our ideal in culture and arts, as in all matters.
We see that all the world's important cultural and artistic works carry local and national influences. The architecture of Renaissance Europe, which influenced the world, is an example of this. We know that the works of the late Cengiz Aytmatov, each of which has become a world classic, flourished within the Kyrgyz culture. Aren't each of Dostoyevsky's and Tolstoy's Russian, Shakespeare's English, and Victor Hugo's French culture-themed works world classics? Then, we can create universal products that sprout from our own culture. As long as we can get rid of those complexes that they have been trying to drown us in for years and be ourselves. Believe me, the rest is very easy. We have worked for this for 16 years. We have achieved things, we have failed, but we have never given up the struggle, we will not give up.
My dear brothers and sisters;
As in many other matters, 2002 is a turning point in the revival of our foundation tradition and in protecting the legacy of our ancestors. Since this date, we have strived to protect the foundation's works both at home and abroad. While only 46 cultural properties were restored or repaired in the 10-year period before 2002, we have restored and repaired 5060 cultural properties in the last 16 years. This figure corresponds to a 110-fold increase compared to the previous period.
Thank God, we brought to light more than 10 million documents that remained behind closed doors for years, as a result of meticulous work. Today, the archive of our Turkish Armed Forces has been fully opened and is now ready for review. The Presidential Archive has been opened in the same way and is ready for review. If anyone is brave enough, come. I have constantly made this call, especially to Armenians, to those who claim the so-called Armenian genocide; If you have the courage, come here, we are opening our archives, if you have it, open your archives too. But they do nothing but smear Turkey and continue campaigns against Turkey together with their diasporas around the world. There is plenty of money, they are spending the money, and they want to turn Turkey into a criminal situation. You won't be able to bring it, because we are right. Millions of works, which were condemned to dusty shelves in cellars for a long time, are now offered for the benefit of our people in modern foundation museums, the number of which we have increased from 4 to 11.
We find, restore and revive many heirlooms of our ancestors, not only in the country but also in different corners of our heartland. So far, we have completed the inventory of foundation cultural assets in three countries: Crimea, Hungary and Yemen. We restored the ruined İsa Bey Bath and Gradişka Derviş Hanım Madrasa in Sarajevo and opened them to service. The restoration and reconstruction works of the Alaca Mosque in Foça and the Sinanbey Mosque in Çayniçe, which were destroyed during the war, are still continuing. Likewise, the restoration of the Bascarsija Mosque and Travnik Alaca Mosque in Sarajevo and the Arnavudiye Mosque in Banyaluka continues. We also revived the Haydar Kadı Mosque, which had been closed and completely ruined for 100 years in Bitola, Macedonia.
Project works for the restoration of Ohrid Ali Pasha Mosque, Skopje İsa Bey Mosque and its outbuildings, Yahya Pasha Mosque and Monastir Hacı Mahmut Bey Mosque are also continuing. The same reconstruction of the Hadım Süleyman Ağa Library in Cakova, Kosovo was completed and it became ready for service. Project work continues for the Müezzin Hoca Mosque in Mitrovica, the Alaaddin Bey, Pirinaz and Buzağı Mosques in Pristina, as well as the Gazi Ali Bey Mosque in Vıçıtırın. While the restoration of Dükkânlar Önü Mosque in Nicosia continues, the projects of Selimiye Mosque and Famagusta Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosques are currently being prepared.
Project work for the İsa Bey Bath in Novi Pazar, Serbia, continues. We have prepared the cooperation protocol for the Albania Shkodra Kurşunlu Mosque, and after the approval of our interlocutors, we are immediately going out to tender. We witness similar scenes of pride in many areas, from the discovery of the graves of our martyrs to the return of artifacts smuggled abroad to our country. Above all, we are currently building a magnificent mosque in the capital Tirana in Albania.
My dear friends;
I consider this meaningful ceremony held at the Presidential Complex as the most beautiful sign of the sensitivity we display in protecting the trust. On behalf of myself and my nation, I congratulate our General Directorate of Foundations for restoring 250 foundation works in 7 regions of our country in accordance with their essence, spirit and intended use.
Among the 250 restored works, there are mosques, masjids, libraries, dormitories, mansions, tombs, lodges, inns, baths, caravanserais, as well as churches and synagogues. These 250 restorations include Nusaybin Zeynel Abidin Mosque and Diyarbakır Sur Armenian Protestant Church, which were greatly damaged in the attacks of the separatist organization. The ownership of places of worship in different cities of our country, without being subjected to any discrimination or marginalization, is very important in terms of showing our perspective on members of other faiths.
O dark faces of France who pretend to be bright, you demand and propose the removal of some verses from the Holy Quran. Look, in our civilization, in our understanding, there is no approach or understanding that says remove this and that from the Bible, the Psalms, the Torah. On the contrary, we find all the heavenly books respectable and do not speculate on them. And is it your place to use these expressions about our holy book, the Holy Quran? You've already messed it up a lot lately; If it means attacking our mosques, you attack our mosques, if it means arson, you commit arson. But in our country, attacking a church and allowing the attacker; What did we do to do such a thing, what did we get done, that is the difference between us. You are no different from DAESH, at all.
This attitude is actually the best answer given to bloody terrorist organizations such as DAESH, FETO and Boko Haram, who use our beloved religion for their own perverted ideologies. Use it abundantly. In our belief, places of worship have immunity, especially our holy books... Anyone who violates this, regardless of the motivation, is also against the provisions of Islam and is un-Islamic. On the other hand, our attitude should also be a lesson to some Islamophobic European politicians, especially Sarkozy, who protect those who attack Islam and pat the backs of those who set fire to mosques in the name of defending Western values.
The mentality of the fascists, who try to blame the massacres of a few murderers on Muslims, and the inhumane ideologies of DAESH terrorists are like two sides of the same coin. These two seemingly hostile groups actually serve the same purpose. Our civilization is far from both these sick understandings. Just as we are against those who set fire to mosques in the heart of Europe, we are also against those who attack churches in Syria and Iraq. Just as we defend the freedom of worship of our citizens, we also defend the freedom of worship of all members of other faiths.
Ancestors say, 'the educated and ignorant are more harmful than the illiterate.' We see the latest statements made by a few ignorant people in France as mere reflections of their ignorance. This group knows neither our holy book, nor their own history, nor the Bible and Torah, which they claim to believe in. We do not and will not take into account the delusions of this group that has lost its balance and has become academically, politically and intellectually moldy. As members of a civilization that protects the oppressed regardless of religion, language or belief, we will continue to defend rights, justice and the ideal of living together in peace, as we have done so far.
We will neither leave the field to DAESH and FETO perverts, nor will we bow to the propaganda of Islamophobic circles. Along with our mosques, we will consider the places of worship of members of other religions as our honor, and we will try to protect them to the end. Today, we will show our Western friends, who are afraid of minarets and who confine Muslims to small masjids instead of allowing mosques, what freedom of worship and belief should be like, with our practices like here today. I pray that God will help us.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I once again wish that the restored works will be beneficial to all Muslims. I would like to express my gratitude to our Government for bringing these works to our country and nation in their original form. Stay healthy.

Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2018-05-08,"

My dear parliamentary friends,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, affection, longing and affection. I pray to God that the AK Party Turkish Grand National Assembly Group Meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country. I hope you have a successful and productive week in your parliamentary work.
The election calendar for the June 24 elections is currently working for both the Supreme Electoral Council and our own party. The presidential candidates have now been determined to a large extent, and the processes regarding parliamentary candidacy continue. The evaluation of our candidates has started in our commissions. As the candidate of the AK Party and Nationalist Movement Party people's alliance, we have made our official application to the Supreme Electoral Council. Likewise, our alliance protocol was delivered to the Supreme Electoral Council.
Some of the other parties managed to form an alliance for the parliamentary election; But each of them goes to the Presidential elections with their own candidate. Of course, each party has the right to choose its own presidential candidate. As a matter of fact, some parties announced their leaders as presidential candidates by group decision or by collecting signatures. Except for one party, the leader of the main opposition party did not want to be a presidential candidate for some reason. Managing his party must have been more attractive than aspiring to govern Turkey, so he put forward another name as a candidate.
This name is not the umbrella candidate they have been talking about for a long time. Candidate for general chairmanship at CHP congresses; But they suggested a name that could not be elected for the presidency of Turkey. So, in the eyes of the main opposition party, the Chairmanship of the Republican People's Party is a more important and critical task than the presidency. In fact, Kılıçdaroğlu's attitude, attitude, expressions, facial expressions and the way he introduced his presidential candidate clearly reveal his view on this issue.
The basis of our respect for the office of the President is that the person who assumes this duty is, first of all, the highest representative of the republic, that is, the nation. The person who will aspire to a position that will represent our country and nation at the highest level must be a suitable person. CHP listed many qualities for its presidential candidates, from success stories to knowledge of economics, but when the name was announced, no one could relate the qualities mentioned in this candidate.
Not only that, the main opposition party sent 15 members of parliament to another party on duty yesterday, leaving them in tears. Now they have assigned their voters to serve in election boards for presidential candidates of other parties. They explain this with democracy. Marketing MPs and voters for political engineering purposes is not within the rules of democracy anywhere in the world. I'm afraid this will end up in CHP's wholesale sales. Anyway, I do not want to prolong this issue any further, anyway, CHP will answer for all of these to our nation one by one during the election campaign.
My brothers;
Of course, we have a problem here; we do not know whether to look at the person leading the CHP in the election campaign or the poor person he puts forward. Well, there is a real one and a puppet. You know, as in the Hacivat-Karagöz plays, there is a figure, a puppet, in front of the curtain; But all the talking and movements are done by the puppeteer holding the stick in the background. Now, we are actually confused as to whether we should deal with the figure at the end of the stick or the person holding the stick.
They set out saying they would drive us crazy. We have to give them their due, although they didn't drive us crazy, they managed to surprise us. This lying wrestler, who constantly challenges us and goes out of his way when we say 'come on, here is the private field', entertains our nation even though he is of no use. We will continue to follow the adventures of this cartoon character and his candidate until the elections.
The truth is, my biggest regret about the past 16 years is that we could not find a main opposition suitable for our weight. For this reason, as I have always said, we had to compete both in service and politics with ourselves. We worked to break our own records, we strived to exceed our own projects, thank God, with our love of service to our nation, we have achieved services that are 3 times, 5 times and 10 times the services provided in the entire Republic period in 16 years.
Now we have a new era ahead of us, we have raised the bar of success both in terms of services and projects and in political criteria. If you pay attention, no one forced us to raise the criteria, we implemented them all of our own free will, because this was the need of a growing and strengthening Turkey. The only way for our country to achieve its 2023 goals and realize its 2053 and 2071 visions was to adapt the management system accordingly. In the multi-party era, almost all leaders, all prime ministers, all presidents identified and dreamed; But thank God, we were able to realize this change that he could not implement.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Until today, we have always been in favor of change, innovation and development, and we have carried out our actions in this direction. On the other hand, when we look at the promises of the opposition, we see the following picture: One of them has his eyes on the Presidential Complex, the other has his eyes on the state's planes, the other has his eyes on the new management system, and they say 'we will destroy them, we will destroy them'. One of them was going to go to Çankaya and sleep there, and the other one was going to allocate this complex to the young people. Is there such a policy? What kind of dwarf policy is this? What do those who think that they will make politics by sleeping in Çankaya and turning it into a guest house think of this nation? And this nation will give what is necessary on June 24th.
These are very simple, populist policies. These are now a thing of the past, no one swallows them. The nation expects from you the project of what you will build, not what you will demolish. You don't have a tree planted yet, tell me what you will plant. Tell me if you have a project in mind for Turkey, for the Turkish nation, that will be remembered, that will cure the troubles, and that will go down in history.
We shared our manifesto with our nation on Sunday, and hopefully we will share our projects soon. Shouldn't the opposition, which has been waiting for 16 years to come to power, have much bigger claims and many more projects? But not. They have only one problem, and that is to destroy Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Our nation brought us to the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Mayorship, the AK Party Chairmanship, the Prime Ministry and the Presidency. If one day our nation says 'ok', only then will we step aside. Until today, whoever tried to destroy us unjustly and unlawfully, from tutelaries to coup plotters, we, along with our nation, stood against them every time. I believe that, hopefully, on June 24, together with our nation, we will once again teach the demolition team the lesson they deserve.
My brothers;
Of course, there are other presidential candidates. The more candidates we compete with, the more satisfied we will be; That's the beauty of democracy. Those who want to see the point Turkey has reached in democracy should come and look at the wide range, diversity and colorfulness of the June 24 elections. However, every brave man has his own way of eating yoghurt. Others' style may be to destroy and destroy. Our understanding of politics is based on service, projects, investment and construction. In these elections, we will tell our nation what we have done and what we will do in every field, from democracy to economy, from justice to infrastructure.
We said that the opposition has no project, but I think we were unfair. They have one project and they have already announced it. This project is to return Turkey to the old system. First of all, this attitude disrespects the will of the nation revealed on April 16. Since they promise the opposite of everything the AK Party does, I hereby appeal to our nation: Ask those who come to you with these promises the following:
AK Party built 284 thousand new classrooms in Turkey, will you demolish them too? AK Party has hired 585 thousand new teachers in Turkey, will you fire them too? AK Party opened 111 new universities in Turkey, will you close them too? AK Party provided broadband internet service to 69 million people in Turkey, will you cut them too?
AK Party brought 1245 new hospitals and 130 thousand new hospital beds to Turkey; Will you remove them too? AK Party has employed 540 thousand new healthcare workers in Turkey, will you throw them out too? AK Party has put nearly 5 thousand new ambulances into service in Turkey. Are you going to scrap these too? AK Party built 817 thousand new houses in Turkey, will you demolish them too?
The AK Party built 20 thousand kilometers of new divided roads in Turkey. Are you going to remove their asphalt and turn them into fields again? The AK Party opened 258 new tunnels with a length of 383 kilometers in Turkey. Will you fill them with stones and soil again? The AK Party built high-speed train lines in Turkey and modernized the existing train lines. Will you return to black trains again? AK Party built 29 new airports in Turkey and increased the number of international flight destinations to 307. Will you close them again?
AK Party extracted natural gas from 78 provinces, which was used in only 6 provinces, and 81 provinces by the end of the year; Will you remove these natural gas pipes and turn the houses back to coal stoves? AK Party built 525 dams and 528 hydroelectric power plants, opened 207 drinking water facilities and 1232 irrigation facilities. Will you demolish them and let the water flow into the seas again? AK Party has afforested 5 million hectares of land, will you uproot them?
AK Party has provided 38 billion liras of social aid, will you go and ask for it back from weird-gureba? AK Party paid 15 billion liras of Savings Encouragement Fund to approximately 4.5 million people and 3.5 billion liras of Housing Assistance to more than 8 million people. Will you take them back? AK Party has enlarged Turkey 3.5 times in 16 years, will you make it smaller again? The AK Party made Turkey's currency reputable by adding 6 zeros to it. Are you going to bring back the days when you can go to the toilet by adding six zeros to this single-digit number? AK Party increased exports from 36 billion dollars to 161 billion dollars, will you reduce it to the old figure again?
AK Party has brought Marmaray, Eurasia Tunnel, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, Osman Gazi Bridge, Ovit Tunnel and many other giant works to the country, will you dynamite all of them and destroy them? The AK Party has taken very important steps towards saving our country from foreign dependency in the defense industry. Will you bury unmanned aerial vehicles, armed unmanned aerial vehicles, rifles, missiles, cannons and tanks, just as your past buried them in the ground? Your past turned the factories into gas furnace factories, will you turn them into gas furnace factories again?
The AK Party goes and crushes the heads of terrorist organizations in their lairs, will you surrender the country to them again? AK Party has neutralized 4423 terrorists in Syria from Operations Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch, I am telling you the current figure, it has made an area of ​​4 thousand square kilometers safe, it has started to ensure the return of refugees here, are you going to leave these places to terrorist organizations again?
Yes, I ask my nation; When the opposition comes to you tomorrow to ask for votes, please ask them these questions. Those who want to return Turkey to the old administrative system probably have the intention of doing this as well. Mehmet Akif describes such things very well:
“Does destroying give people the same value as building?
I'm sure even the hottest guys can fuck her.
Just show me, this is the dome,
Süleymaniye now descends with two farmhands.
But when they say 'come, let's remove it', then, alas,
We need another Süleyman, and another Sinan.
Do you have any of these on your list? no.
What about? ""One dry tongue, you go ahead, I'm full.""
Yes, we know that our nation is fed up with their dry-tongued words. Hopefully, on election day, we will once again see at the ballot box the difference between those who set out to build and those who set out to destroy.
My brothers;
I would like to reiterate once again that our commitment to our nation is to immediately implement the new management system with all its elements, to immediately identify its shortcomings and shortcomings and to eliminate them. We know very well the opportunities that the change in the management system will provide us. In our manifesto, we partially expressed the dream of Türkiye that we envision with these opportunities. We will explain the issues regarding concrete services and investments in our declaration. Of course, the AK Party has been in power for 16 years and there is an accumulation that has emerged during this time. This is what we could do with the old management system. While the world is changing and Turkey is changing, it is absolutely unthinkable for the AK Party and us, as the president who will form the government in the new period, to remain in our place.
First of all, we have serious knowledge and experience; We have nearly 5 years of experience as mayor of a city like Istanbul, then we have 11.5 years of experience as prime minister, and then we have approximately 3.5-4 years of experience as president. This is not only national experience, we also have international experience, that is, this team is not an apprentice who is just starting out, both myself and my friends are experienced and experienced... Hopefully, we will not be new starters in the next period. What about?.. I hope we will continue to build on the progress we have made by quickly putting new projects on it. We are now determined to pursue much higher goals in line with the spirit of the new management system.
However, none of those against us have any such experience, experience or such things. They will start this business from scratch, they will start fresh, but we will now build on the progress we have made and hopefully take our steps with new projects and quickly raise our country above the level of contemporary civilizations. Of course, this is never a contradiction with the old or a rejection of the old, on the contrary, it is a process of building a brand new Turkey based on the accumulation of 16 years.
For us yesterday, our majority in the Parliament and our government based on it were the source of power for the work we will do to save our country and nation from the neglect they have been subjected to for a long time. Tomorrow, we demand the presidential government and the Parliamentary majority that will support it as the source of power to help Turkey achieve its goals and our nation to achieve its dreams. Because we have a lot of work to do.
Despite the sabotage carried out by terrorist organizations in democracy by using every means, we have many steps forward. We have projects to implement to reverse the wave of attacks that have no rational or technical basis in the economy and are carried out entirely on exchange rates. We have a lot of work to do in foreign policy in every field, especially in Syria, Iraq, Iran, the Balkans, the European Union, America, Russia, Central Asia and Africa. We need to continue the operations that have become inevitable within and outside our borders regarding security and further strengthen our unity and solidarity. We have educational institutions, health institutions, new highways to build, high-speed train lines, dams and strangers to lend a hand that will improve the quality of service.
Of course, the presidential government system will be a very important convenience in order to do all these effectively and decisively. But at the same time, we must have a majority in the Parliament. First of all, until the system is established, there will be a need to enact many laws or amendments to the law, or even constitutional amendments, in addition to presidential decrees.
My request from my dear nation is this: You have not left us alone until now, this time you will add a much different power to the people's alliance by giving us the power to make constitutional changes. We owe the actions we have taken so far to the stability and trust environment we have provided. The majority in the Parliament is important in ensuring stability and trust in the new period.
My brothers;
Our aim with the People's Alliance is not only to obtain the majority in the Parliament, but also to reach the number of constitutional amendments required for reforms. I believe that with the support of our nation, the People's Alliance will rise above the bar of constitutional amendment, I trust my nation. Tayyip Erdoğan has never taken any step, done anything, or made any decision that would be against his country and people. Despite this, the troubles, problems, deficiencies and perhaps mistakes that arise are not caused by malicious intent or laziness, but by changes in the natural flow of life.
It is not possible to predict where the people or groups you knew well yesterday and decided to walk together with will change their route tomorrow. We have never hesitated, and will never hesitate, to serve our country and nation with good intentions, in accordance with the command of our Lord, and to be together with everyone. When the roads forked, we always looked to our nation and continued to walk in the direction it showed. There was nothing we could do other than say 'goodbye' to those we were together in the past, who later set themselves different directions, other paths and other goals, and that's exactly what we did.
Our only responsibility and commitment is to our nation, our country; Apart from that, we have no obligation or obligation to anyone. We have never hesitated to hold our nation accountable for what we have done and what we have not done so far. Our account is to the public, to God, and this should be known as such. Today, we give this account by giving our chests to everyone, everywhere.
As sincerely as we worked for the success of our national unity and brotherhood project, we were equally sincere in burying the separatist organization in the ditches it opened and finding it in its lairs and attacking it. Our only concern was to ensure that our nation could look to its future with confidence, peace and hope. We have never been hypocritical or bilingual like the parties and organizations under the control of the terrorist organization. We have said the same things to everyone everywhere, at all times, in all situations, and we continue to say them.
Similarly, we were truly sincere when we met with the Syrian administration in the past, both as our border neighbors and as representatives of our brothers with whom we share an ancient historical past. When the regime began to oppress its own people, we were equally sincere in our support to our Syrian brothers both inside and outside our borders. Even the regime itself could not provide the services that we have provided to the Syrian people in the past 7 years, let alone another country.
During the European Union membership process, we sat down with our interlocutors, talked and looked for ways to reach an agreement on every issue we deemed to be in the interest of our country and nation; However, when the issue came to the point of independence of our country and nation, we never refrained from shouting the truth to the other person's face. We have not consented to any project that does not aim to integrate Turkey into the European Union equally and fairly.
The other day, an ignorant group appeared in France and published a statement demanding the removal of some verses from the Holy Quran. It is obvious that those who say this have no knowledge of the Holy Quran, but have they ever read their own book, the Bible, or the Torah, or the Psalms? If they read it, they would probably want the Bible to be banned too. But they never have such a problem, such a concern. As we warn Western countries about Islamophobia, Turkism, xenophobia and racism, our reputation gets worse.
O West, look, as long as we attack our holy book, know that we will not attack your holy books. But we will bring you down, know that too. First of all, who are you to attack our sacred things? We know how despicable you are. You have already done this everywhere, you are doing this, we just didn't know you. But no matter how much you do these things, we will not attack your sacred ones with the same language. Because we are not despicable like you. We have a stance, we have a character, we have a structure. We know very well to whom, where and in what language to speak. That's why no matter what anyone says, we will continue to shout the truth.
During our rule, Turkey, as Turkey, did not act with an understanding of unconditional loyalty or unconditional hostility to any country or international institution. We are committed to principles, not people. It is fine if our opponents comply with these principles, and if they do not, we are sorry, Turkey is free to do whatever it wishes in line with its own interests; Let this be known as well. We have always acted this way until today, and we will continue the same way from now on.
My brothers;
It is in such a climate that we are rapidly approaching the June 24 elections. Now the days are getting closer to election day Sunday. By continuing our candidate selection process meticulously, we are determined to appear before our nation with names that everyone will say 'this is it'.
My dear brothers and sisters;
I will say it loud and clear; Of course, we will appear before our people with a list of 600 names. There will be those who are on our lists, and there will be those who are not. We will try to do these as much as we can with the precision of a jeweler. Those who take part or those who do not take part should understand us at this point. Our only concern with these lists, which we will create by implementing many criteria, is to present ourselves to our people in the most ideal way possible. Of course, we have many sensitivities here; From the demographic structure of the region to the sensitivities in that region, we want to review all of these, women, young people, and establish these balances... We want to create our lists by establishing these balances.
The stronger our parliamentary group is, the more comfortable we will be in the executive as a presidential government. The People's Alliance has gone very well so far, may God keep it safe. Unlike the three dissimilar alliances established by other parties, we will face our nation with a single presidential candidate. We have to make the most efficient use of the approximately 7-week period until the election. Hopefully, the blessings of the month of Ramadan, which we will enter next week, will be reflected in our election work. I had the opportunity to visit 50 cities in the last 5 months thanks to our provincial congresses. We will definitely carry out a program that covers at least our big cities until the election date. We will continue our full field work together with the announcement of the parliamentary candidate lists.
My dear brothers, main level, ladies, young people; There is no stopping in these 7 weeks, keep going. Young people, you will also meet and embrace our high school and university young friends. You will also tell those friends what they do not know, what we have done that I just explained in my speech. You may think: Is there anyone who doesn't know this? Yes, people have limited memory, they don't know, you will explain. Tell it so they can tell it to others who don't know.
And don't forget our Rabia; One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state... That's why we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together. With these feelings, I once again offer you my love and respect.
Stay healthy.
",2023-06-24,"The Cumhur Alliance, established by the AK Party and MHP, gained the majority in the Parliament.",before
Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2018-04-24,"

My dear parliamentary friends,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to God that the AK Party Turkish Grand National Assembly Group Meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country. I hope you have a successful and productive week, especially in our work in the Parliament this week.
On this occasion, a known earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 occurred in Adıyaman Samsat district at 03:34 tonight. Thank God, there was no loss of life, we had 13 injured people, they received outpatient treatment, and the material damage will be repaired anyway. Currently, Mr. Recep and Mr. Ahmet are going to Adıyaman, they will examine all the events there on site.
Dear friends;
We have very important work to do before the holiday, especially the package of amendments to the Election Laws. After completing these quickly, we will immediately disperse to our constituencies and hopefully start working day and night in the field.
At the very beginning of my words, I would like to once again congratulate our nation and all our children on the April 23 National Sovereignty and Children's Day, which we celebrated with enthusiasm yesterday. On a day when we are experiencing the joy of our national sovereignty, I would like to express once again that I do not approve of the images and discussions that you witnessed yesterday in the General Assembly of the Parliament.
I hereby strongly condemn those who use their own sick politics to poison this important national holiday of our country. The delusions of the person who wants to trivialize our nation's July 15 epic and hide his escape from the path opened by the coup plotters that night have now reached the level of disrespect for our martyrs. And I would like to remind the truth again to those who used all kinds of false or false statements there yesterday.
At 23:17 on the night of July 15, the head of the main opposition is at Ataturk Airport and talks are being held there with the leaders of the tanks. After it is done, tanks open the road and Mr. Kemal, the head of the main opposition, escapes from there to Bakırköy and is hosted at the house of the Mayor of Bakırköy. While he sips his coffee and drinks his tea, he follows the developments.
Of course, we then come to Atatürk Airport from Marmaris. How did I arrive at that airport and how I landed at that airport with our Minister of Energy, Berat Bey, my wife, my daughter, my grandchildren... There was a rude person there yesterday, how do you know how? I was the one who experienced the incident, we got up here and talked to the Istanbul Police Chief like this, we talked to this person like this, and then we went down there like this. There is something called wisdom in a person, there is something called morality.
And at 23:17, you are there with your chairman, and we are coming there from Marmaris, yes, with our plane, and when we land on that runway, F-16s and helicopters are still flying there. And after we land, there are tens of thousands of people there, you can deceive the CHP members, but you cannot deceive those tens of thousands, and those tens of thousands are the closest witnesses to this event. But you don't have such a problem. You've always run away, you've never been one of those who heroically stood up against F-16s, you've never been one of those who stood up against tanks. You were even among those who applauded on Bağdat Street.
Dear brothers and sisters, we personally managed this operation, which lasted 16 hours, at the airport. Mr. Kemal, where were you at those hours? You were in Bakırköy, while you were sipping coffee, we were there at Atatürk Airport with my minister friends, MP friends and all those national heroes. The next day, Saturday, we didn't leave. The operation was over, we stood there tall until it was over. And besides, our Governor, also the First Army Commander, currently the Second President, was also there. There I said to him, 'Go and hold a press conference.' We gave the General Staff there, by proxy, to Ümit Pasha. Mr. Kemal, do you know these? And there, we managed the process by giving the acting Chief of General Staff to our current Deputy Chief, Ümit Pasha.
Of course, yesterday I saw that the President is sitting on the balcony anyway, he does not have the authority or the right to speak here, you are shaking a lot from there and making rude hand and arm gestures. You can make this gesture to the Chairman of the AK Party, but you cannot do it to the President of this country. That's why you will know your place once; But there is nothing like this in them, they do not have such a sense of morality. Therefore, of course, the developments there yesterday were truly a disaster, a disaster. This mentality, which considers it political to insult the President elected by the will of our nation under a roof that is the manifestation of the national will, in front of the eyes of the whole country and the world, is doomed to drown in its own filth.
First, Mr. Kemal, you sent 15 of your men to the so-called İyi Party. So, did these 15 men accept your so-called Good Party? He did not accept. Why? Yesterday, I saw that these 15 of your men are not in the seats of the so-called İyi Party, they are still in the CHP seats. Why didn't they go there? It means they didn't like the place you sent. So they couldn't agree, they couldn't convince. And I don't know how the scenario will work from now on, anything can happen, let me tell you that. But one thing is known, the so-called Good Party, there were three or four people there yesterday, the back seats are empty, where are they? They are in the ranks of the CHP Group. But there was such an opportunity and thus the so-called İyi Party took advantage of that opportunity.
The best thing is, my dear friends: There is a very strange scenario in the market right now: Let's see how this scenario will play out by the end of the week. Thank God, we do not have such a problem. We have taken a step in this regard, we are currently preparing our manifesto, our election manifesto and we are on our way. Hopefully these will be announced as soon as possible. First of all, hopefully we will announce it on the 6th of the month, which will hopefully be our manifesto. Then, hopefully, we will have the opportunity to explain our election declaration to our entire nation, including its members and mosques, in our candidate introduction meeting.
Of course, this is not the only delusion of the head of the main opposition. This person recently succumbed to his sectarian obsessions and slandered the Ottoman Empire. Wow, what an immoral approach. On this occasion, we saw once again how far the heart of this person, who accused the Ottoman Empire of oppressing its founding elements, the Yoruks and Turkmens, was from our nation. Once you know your place. These people were actually the people to whom Sultan Abdülhamid-i Sani once handed over his door. How come you are trying to tear the Ottomans away from the Yoruks or other tribes, even though you handed over your life security to them? Our ancestors considered it their duty to stop oppressing the Yoruks and to stand by all those who were oppressed all over the world, from the interior of Europe to the depths of Africa.
It is well understood that this person, who vomits his hostility towards all values, history and culture of our nation under the excuse of the Ottoman Empire, will not prosper. Hopefully, on June 24, we will see the extent of this person's stature, who speaks the same language and probably shares the same feelings with all segments of society that strive to denigrate Turkey, from Armenian gangsters to separatists and FETO members, if he has the courage to come forward.
I leave it to my nation to appreciate the events that took place in the Parliament yesterday, in front of the eyes of all Turkey. I believe that even yesterday's image proves once again how accurate it is for Turkey to change its management system. Mr. Kemal, don't waste your time, come and become a candidate immediately. Why do you keep searching left and right? Being a candidate is worthy of a chairman. Come and become a candidate. Let us also see the love of my beloved nation towards you. Don't waste any time and hit the road early. By separating the legislative and executive branches, it will be possible to get rid of the heavy costs of such unnecessary discussions on the daily life of our nation.
Dear friends;
Last week, after our Group Meeting, we held the meetings of our National Security Council and Council of Ministers. At these meetings, among other issues on our agenda, we decided to continue the state of emergency for another three months. Of course, there was another important event that took place on the same day. Before going into that, I need to evaluate the discomfort related to this state of emergency.
Mr. Kemal, you were once a civil servant, so you do not know how emergency decisions are made, how they continue or not. But know that the times when this country was governed under a state of emergency were not the same as when we implement state of emergency decisions now. And at that time, factories would constantly go on strike, and with these strikes, the factories would become inoperable. I would like to address the entire industry from here; I wonder if there is such a strike in a single factory right now, including this 7th state of emergency? What is our biggest record when something like this happens? State of emergency. What do we do immediately? We intervene and the state of emergency becomes a very serious source of solution. And during this period, industry in Turkey did not stop. Intensive work continued. It is out of the question for them to ever stop them anyway. There is an environment where there is peace, and in such an environment they stand up and demand that there should be no state of emergency. Why? Because that's why the counter will break. We will not make you break this scheme.
He gives advice: 'Do not enter Afrin.' Why should we not enter Afrin? Their problems are different, because terrorist organizations are running around there, they want them to continue doing so. If it were up to them, what are you doing in Cudi, what are you doing in Gabar, what are you doing in Tendürek, what are you doing in Beslerderesi; They see this lying down and getting up. Mr. Kemal, you should know that we will not leave Cudi, Gabar, Beslerderesi, Tendürek or even Kandil. We will continue to do whatever the peace of our nation requires. We will do whatever is necessary in northern Syria. So I asked again today, what is the number of terrorists neutralized now? 4272. What happened in Northern Iraq? 353. What happened domestically? 258. No stopping, keep going.
See, it is very interesting; They were disturbed by our departure, but thank God, they also went and visited the police station later, which is a good development. And we are all together with our Mehmet on this path, we are also with the Free Syrian Army on this path. We cannot put aside the struggle of our brothers in the Free Syrian Army with the Mehmetçik. Together with our Mehmetçik, they killed death in the north of Syria and went after it. And they planted our flag along with their own flags on the institutions there; that's the point. What did Mr. Kemal say? ""They are terrorists,"" he said. Think about it, these are the people who stoop so low as to call these people, whose number exceeded 200, including my Mehmet, who disregarded their lives in that land and drank the sherbet of martyrdom, as 'terrorists'. I hope Olive Branch is an epic, Operation Euphrates Shield is an epic, all of these will be recorded.
Now let's come to the final process. MHP Chairman Mr. Bahçeli made an early election proposal in his Group speech just before us. They themselves proposed the date of August 26 for this. Since we have not yet negotiated it internally, I did not see any harm in emphasizing twice in our group speech that the elections will be held in November 2019. Immediately after our group talk, we had a consultation with our friends in our back room. Our consultations continued after our National Security Council and Council of Ministers meetings. And last Wednesday, we had a previously planned meeting with Mr. Bahçeli, and by holding it the next day, on Wednesday, I had the opportunity to discuss the early election issue with him.
Of course, our consultations with our friends continued until and after this meeting, including that morning, that is, Wednesday morning. As it is known, the main opposition party has called for early elections many times and challenged us in its own way. Of course, since we are used to such empty works of the main opposition, we looked at what our nation says and wants and determined our course of action accordingly. After the Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party's call for early elections, we saw that the main opposition party came forward again by calling it a challenge, without making any evaluation or statement.
This picture pointed out to us that Turkey was irreversibly heading towards an early election climate. However, we had a period of 1.5 years that we could use for both the Presidency and the Government, so it was possible for us to sit in this seat for another 1.5 years. After long consultations among ourselves, we decided to save Turkey from the early election debate it was in by sacrificing our 1.5-year Presidency and Government period.
During these consultations, we also evaluated that August is a late date for early elections. Considering that our country should not waste time, taking into account the summer holidays of our citizens and university entrance exams, we have determined that it would be correct to hold the elections on Sunday, June 24, 2018. Thus, we have the opportunity to save Turkey from the system that we now refer to as 'old' after the referendum on April 16, 2017, but which was in effect until the elections in accordance with the constitutional amendment.
Dear friends;
After announcing June 24 as the early election date, we completed the necessary processes in our Assembly and immediately took the early election decision. Our Supreme Electoral Council is slowly creating the election calendar. Accordingly, 10 political parties, determined by the Supreme Electoral Board to meet the necessary conditions, according to the records kept by the Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Appeals, are participating in the election.
Of course, in the meantime, we encountered a strange situation that we know as the disease of old Turkish politics. That is, the 15 MPs who resigned from the main opposition party that I just mentioned, moved to another party and enabled this party to form a group in the Parliament. The table and explanations in the middle show that 15 MPs did this job as a party instruction, against their own political preferences and will. However, when we examine the decision number 264 of the Supreme Electoral Council, we see that the party that was formed into a group with its MPs has already gained the right to participate in the elections by passing the organization and congress threshold. So, the aim here is not to get the party in question into the election. Because the decision of the Supreme Electoral Council shows that this party is already qualified to enter the elections. We will probably see the purpose of this strange operation, which frankly means disregarding the will of the nation, in the coming days.
We are the ones who legally legitimize alliances in politics, we took the steps to achieve this. We announced our alliance with MHP months ago, in full view of our nation, and without any secret or dirty bargaining. He is from Siirt and tells about the period when I was a candidate. You don't know, ask someone first, everything they tell you is a lie. There is already a lie in your character and in your personality. You are telling me that I am a candidate by making 3 MPs in Siirt resign, but you haven't learned that correctly either, there is no such thing. Moreover, the form of this work is not even remotely related to this. But they will make up something, a lie, a slander; We didn't come here just out of the blue, we came here by working hard.
The alliance between AK Party and MHP was made transparently, in front of 81 million people and on a legitimate basis. The people in front of us are doing business in the dark, winking at each other. They are trying to establish an alliance whose color, identity, personality, dignity, nothing is clear, with unclear negotiations, whose sole purpose is hostility towards Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, this is what they are doing. Türkiye has encountered such political engineering many times in the past. But every time, our nation has respected those who respect its will and those who are willing to serve it, not dirty deals. This plot clustered around the main opposition is not our issue as the AK Party, so we do not need to react or say anything other than finding this issue strange.
Our nation, the greatest referee, follows and evaluates all this. This is the punishment my nation will give to them, just as they punished those involved in the Güneş Motel incident in the past. When our nation goes to the polls, it will make its decision based on the results. From now on, as always, we will speak only to our nation, whom we see as our only interlocutor. We will give an account to our nation for what we have done so far, and we will also present to our nation the commitment of what we will do from now on.
We also determined our own calendar in accordance with the election calendar of the Supreme Electoral Council. We continue all our preparations rapidly, from candidate applications to trend polls, from our election declaration to campaign planning. In the past 5 months, we have coincidentally started an election marathon by attending 49 first congresses myself and our Prime Minister attending 29 provincial congresses. We are already on the ground. Now we will try to use the time until the election in the most efficient way. Only Izmir and Istanbul remain among the metropolitan cities, and we will do these too. Women's branches, youth branches, these are being done by the way, we will do them too. We are a party, we are not a party established on a desk, and the principles, work and everything of this party are the expression of a difference.
On Saturday, we will first hold the first congress of our Women's Branch in Istanbul, which I believe will be like a rally, and then we have a provincial congress in Izmir, we will come there. Now that we have entered the election climate, we will hold our first rally in Izmir on the occasion of our first congress and say bismillah. Hopefully, we will evaluate the provincial congress of our Youth Branch in Istanbul on Sunday in the atmosphere of a rally. Immediately afterwards, we will have a long-planned trip to Uzbekistan and South Korea. In the meantime, our plans for the election campaign will also take shape, and hopefully we will continue our work accordingly. And hopefully, we will hold our first indoor gym meeting in Europe in May, hopefully in a European country. All preparations are complete, I do not want to reveal which country it is in advance.
Dear friends;
We see the new period we will enter after the early elections as a guarantee of stability and trust in our country. These are the underlying reasons for our desire to move to a new government system with the constitutional amendment in the April 16 referendum. Our nation had almost shaken off the structure of the current system that constantly produces crises, debates, polemics, coups and junta tutelage. Although we are living in the last months of the old system, the fact that we still see these diseases continuing will enable our nation to appreciate once again the correctness of the presidential system of government. Hopefully, in two months, we will fully pave the way for the construction of a great and powerful Turkey.
Our commitments to our nation in the new era will be as follows: The new era will be a period of more democracy and a stronger rule of law. The new era will be a period of greater prosperity, greater wealth, and greater freedom. The new era will be a period of permanent peace, an environment of permanent trust and greater breakthroughs. The new era will be one in which the executive branch becomes more effective, the legislature becomes more prestigious, and the judiciary becomes more independent.
Even though our population growth rate is not at the level we desire, I still believe that June 24 will be the election of our young people, as one of the countries with the youngest and most qualified population in the world. We are creating a basis for the new system where our youth and children can realize their 2053, 2071 visions, away from tutelage, coups, crises and all the obstacles of the old period.
In foreign policy, we will continue to implement our Turkey-centered and open-to-the-world policy approach even more strongly. We will continue to conduct our relations with all states and international organizations according to this understanding. We will scan the world with a 360-degree perspective and take care not to stay away from any geography, any political and economic formation.
We will continue to implement our security policies on the field, centered on our country and nation, but in accordance with the principles of rights, freedom, justice and protection of human values. We will fight harder on international platforms, especially in terms of humanitarian solidarity, cooperation and increasing friends, and we will increase our activities in the field. In the light of the experiences of our Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations in Syria, we will continue our work with determination in Tel Rifat and Manbij, as a diplomatic priority, and in other regions according to our security requirements.
We will implement policies that are in line with the interests of our country and nation everywhere, from Cyprus to the Aegean, from the Black Sea to Thrace. We will further carry our close relations with our brothers in our region, from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from Central Asia to Africa. We will never give up our conscientious foreign policy approach that supports the oppressed and victims all over the world. As a country that develops initiatives on a global scale in crisis regions such as Jerusalem, Syria, Somalia and Myanmar, we are aware of the magnitude of our responsibilities. In the coming period, we are determined to take further steps in realizing our thesis 'the world is bigger than 5'.
The 7.4 percent growth rate we achieved in the economy last year was the best answer we gave to those who made negative evaluations about our country. I hope we can achieve this rate in the first quarter of this year, I'm telling you now, don't be surprised. It is becoming clearer day by day that the games played on exchange rates have no significant economic justification or depth. Therefore, what is the step we take now? National currency, local currency. Hopefully, we will break this exchange rate game together with the national and local currency. I'm even telling another man, I hope we will take steps to make gold decisive.
I think that we will be able to overcome all the problems that threaten our economy, especially interest and inflation, more easily in the new period, without compromising our budget discipline and reform agenda. The positive reaction of the markets and the business world to the early election decision indicates that this process will trigger opportunities, not risks, in the economy.
As a country that has already implemented 6 of the 10 major projects in the world, investments are indispensable for us, we will continue to invest. Hopefully, we are opening the third airport in Istanbul by the end of this year. Hopefully, by the end of this year, we will hold the tender for Canal Istanbul, a giant project in our Istanbul. Likewise, we will take the steps of passing the 3-storey tunnel across the Bosphorus. And by the way, we laid the foundations of the opposite legs of that magnificent bridge in Çanakkale on March 18, and it is now walking. And of course, all of these are steps based on the build-operate-transfer logic. And we will continue to walk towards our goals with economic policies and investments that will have positive reflections on the daily lives of each of our 81 million citizens in Turkey's 81 provinces.
Of course, when our election documents are prepared, we will have the opportunity to share all of these with our nation in much more detail. And with all this, our Minister of Environment and Urbanization also made a statement, steps will be taken quickly regarding the ugly structures at the certain zoning point in various parts of our country. In this regard, our citizens will now be free from worrying about 'what will be the future of my building, what will be the future of my current building'?
Our nation does not want to hear from us empty words, fruitless polemics, unsupported shootings, but the plans and projects of how we will grow its bread and food, and what kind of future we will leave for itself and its children. Of course, we will not leave the square to the thieves, and we will not refrain from putting those with evil words to their place. However, we will confront our nation by nourishing the hopes of each of our 81 million citizens for their future. This is the area in which we are strongest. While we have such fertile ground in front of us and we have found companions on this path, it is best to leave the main opposition and those who try to get on its paper boat to their own devices.
Dear friends;
In the new era, yes, executive powers are transferred to the president; But the Grand National Assembly of Turkey continues to work stronger and more reputably than before, as the sole authority on legislation. As the AK Party, we have governed our country with this group since the elections held in November 2002.
Together with you, we shattered the shackles that were intended to be placed on the national will. We broke the chains of tutelage together with you. Together with you, we prevented Turkey from being plunged into darkness again with an initiative similar to February 28. Together with you, we demonstrated the most honorable stance shown by Turkish politics when our party was tried to be closed down. By saying 'The world is bigger than 5', we rebelled against the distortions not only in our country but also in the global system, together with you. Together with you, we implemented those silent revolutions that brought Turkey a step forward in democracy and freedom. Together with you, we prevented those who tried to bring our country to its knees through terrorist organizations.
Together with you, we have dispersed all the dark clouds that plagued our country, from the Republic Rallies to the April 27 Declaration, from the Gezi Events to the December 17-25 police-judiciary coup attempt, from the pit actions of the separatist organization to the July 15 coup attempt. While the vandals who attempted to occupy the streets with the support they received from dark forces were destroying everywhere, your firm stance ruined many plans. The games of those who wanted to stage the scenarios fictionalized in Pennsylvania in our country failed because they collided with your will, which stood as solid as a heart of bronze. You gave the best answer to those who want to surround Turkey with holes inside and outside. We started all our operations, from Euphrates Shield to Olive Branch, with your presence and support behind us, and we achieved victory. We carried out the biggest management change in the history of our Republic with your power and will. You went down in history in golden letters with the stance you put forward by saying 'Turkey first' at a time when everyone was trying to provoke you.
Not only that, we also have our signature under every project implemented in Turkey. We have grown Turkey 3.5 times in 15 years together with you. We appeared before our nation with our 2023 goals. We gifted our 2053 and 2071 visions to our children together. Together, we broke records in our exports, employment and production. We were on this path with 36 billion dollars of exports when we took office, but thank God, we have now reached 160 billion dollars. We didn't come here out of the blue. Here we have a Turkey that owes 23.5 billion dollars to the IMF; But in 2013, we came to a Turkey that does not owe a penny to the IMF. Mr. Kemal, this did not happen out of the blue. And even more; While the Central Bank has 27.5 billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves, thank God, we have now reached 110 billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves.
We have brought Turkey through a new era in education, health, justice and security together. In transportation, when we took office, Turkey had 6100 kilometers of divided roads, this many divided roads throughout the history of the Republic in 79 years. Dear friends, we added 19 thousand kilometers of divided roads to this. We pierced the mountains, opened tunnels by drilling the mountains, and reunited the lover with his beloved. These things didn't happen out of the blue, they happened with perseverance and determination. Is there such a thing as high-speed train in this nation's notebooks? But alhamdulillah, we also got the high-speed train. These are currently continuing rapidly. On one side, our Marmaray is under the sea, on the other side, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, on the other side, the Osman Gazi Bridge, on the other side, the Eurasia Tunnel, all these happened during this period. What else will happen next...
Together, we have provided our nation with services that are many times more than those provided in the entire history of the Republic, in energy, urban planning, sports, agriculture, industry, commerce, tourism, business life, in short, in every field. We had a problem in tourism, but alhamdulillah, we hope to have 40 million tourists this year, we are going here again and this will continue to grow from then on. The whole point is; It belongs to those who know how to work and those who gird themselves with the sword. Continue with projects that amaze the world.
Once again, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends who have served our country under the umbrella of the AK Party since 2002. We have come this far with your presence, efforts, productivity, struggle and loyalty. Hopefully, we will stand before our nation in the June 24 elections with the same honorable stance. Just as we have built history together with you in the past 15 years, I hope we will continue on our way in the same way from now on. We will carry our country and our party to the future by working harder, keeping in mind that politics is a relay race. Once again, I would like to thank each and every one of you. May God help us. Stay healthy.

Their Speech at the AK Party Joining Ceremony,2017-05-02,"

Dear members of our AK Party,
Dear members of our Founding Board, Central Decision and Executive Board, Central Disciplinary Board, and Democracy Arbitration Board,
My dear brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection.
Today, I am returning back to my party, my home, my passion, and my love, which I had to leave in accordance with the Constitution due to my election to the Presidency by our nation on August 27, 2014. After exactly 979 days, this longing is coming to an end, thank God.
Today, I am joining your delegation once again by saying 'salamualaikum'.
With the April 16 Constitutional amendment, the law on party membership of presidents was changed and the ban was lifted. I am currently making the best use of such an opportunity and becoming a member of my party again. Of course, this separation was actually just an official separation.
The distance between us was a distance required by law. Our hearts were always together, always together. We know that it is not possible to draw boundaries or build walls around hearts. We always said, 'Who drew this border for my heart / It seems narrow, my friend' and here we are today.
we came.
That day, especially when I was saying goodbye at our Extraordinary Congress, I said, ""Although the AK Party is a political party for 13 years, it is actually a party that carries on its shoulders the legacy of a holy march and a holy cause that started centuries ago."" If it seems like centuries to us
In this respect, the fact that our 979-day separation, which is like a drop in the sea in historical continuity, is coming to an end, excites me in this respect.
I hope we will continue this blessed march, which we undertake to lead and serve on behalf of our nation, in a stronger and more determined manner together in the coming period; I have full faith in this. We set out on the road with our nation. Whatever we've done so far
We did it for our nation, and we will continue to do it for our nation. Whatever problem we have been able to overcome so far, we have achieved it thanks to the prayers and support of our nation. The more we work, strive, and sweat for our nation, the more our nation helps us.
he claimed it. At times, we used our bodies as a shield for our nation, and at times, our nation used their bodies as a shield for us. July 15 was a very clear proof of this.
This is why everyone who attacks Turkey targets us. Some people think that the issue is us, the issue is our government, the issue is our party. However, the issue is our nation, the issue is our country, the issue is our state itself. The issue is our independence,
These are our goals, our claims. We and our nation know this fact very well. With this understanding, we have worked day and night to do our best in every field, from economy to infrastructure, from security to justice, we are working and will continue to do so.
Hopefully, we will continue on our way in the same way from now on.
My brothers;
When we run for President; We said 'this is not a farewell, this is a new beginning' and remember, we started the new era not with a sermon but with Fatiha. Indeed, from the month in which we founded our party in August 2001 to the date when we were elected to the Presidency.
What we experienced until August 2014 is an expression of a historical change and transformation. The closest witness to the services we provide to our country is our nation itself.
As the AK Party, our greatest strength is our success in improving the quality of life of our people, as well as protecting the values ​​of our nation. More importantly; From these services, the biggest one is the one living in a modest hut in the remotest corner of our country.
This is the benefit of every citizen, even those who reside in the tallest building of the city. Of course, we have a world of values ​​and we will continue all kinds of struggles for this cause. But we have never discriminated in our services, we do not and we will not discriminate.
The addressees of my words are those who listen to us, but our actions are for everyone. There are absolutely no second-class citizens in this country, no matter what anyone says, all 80 million people are first-class citizens. We are responsible for all of our people who do not deviate into terrorism, treason and subversion.
It has a place on it. I believe that when we work with this sincerity and effort, we will receive the necessary response from our nation. That's why I would like to remind my dear brothers that our burden will be even heavier from now on. AK Party's success
Those who do not want to understand always look elsewhere. However, if they look at the bond, love and respect that exists between us and our nation, they will also solve the secret of the past 15 years. But it doesn't suit them, they don't look there.
I believe that we have introduced a concept called 'AK Party style politics' to the social sciences literature of our country. Even if they don't believe it, this is the truth... Does such a style of politics exist anymore, has it entered the literature? Entry. Hopefully, this issue will be discussed thoroughly in the coming years.
It will be discussed, discussed and placed within a conceptual framework that will shed light on future generations.
Dear friends;
Even though we were together in spirit, we were legally separated for more than 2.5 years, and Turkey experienced very important events that had vital consequences for our country and nation. Those who do not want to accept the President, who took office directly with the vote of the people, are as usual.
They attempted things that would make them look funny, such as: They displayed every resistance they could think of, from not attending our invitations to not standing up in the Parliament.
Especially after we moved to the Presidential Complex in Beştepe, unimaginable immoralities were exhibited through this building to wear us out and indirectly our Party. We feel the joy of bringing a work of pride to our country.
As always, we blamed those who tried to cast a shadow with such slanders on our nation. As a matter of fact, those who displayed this attitude had to pull themselves together when our nation protected the Presidential Complex and its own home.
Everyone who said 'I won't come' eventually learned the way to Beştepe one day.
On the other hand, the worsening situation in Syria and Iraq has left our country facing a serious terrorist threat both along our borders and in our metropolitan cities. A political party that calls our Kurdish brothers to the streets using the developments in Syria as an excuse
His irresponsibility to the point of betrayal cost the lives of many of our brothers. More than 50 of our citizens, including Yasin Börü and his friends, were vilely murdered in the streets by the supporters of the separatist organization; We cannot ignore this.
Undoubtedly, our nation made them pay the price for this and will make them pay.
We reached the June 7 elections under the shadow of the main opposition's slanders on the one hand and the increasingly insidious actions of terrorist organizations on the other. Remember, in this election Turkey is in danger of losing its atmosphere of stability and trust for the first time since 2002.
faced. The AK Party's inability to obtain a majority to form a government on its own, and the opposition parties' inability to form a unity that would provide a majority among themselves, brought our country to the brink of a devastating crisis. With the power we receive from our nation, we
By using the powers he gave us, we got our country out of the political crisis safely and brought it to the November 1 elections.
Another important problem we experienced between these two elections is that the terrorist acts that have been carried out insidiously for a while have become public and increased. The fact that two of our police officers were martyred by the terrorist organization while they were sleeping in their homes in Ceylanpınar was the turning point for us.
It was the last straw. The state started to attack the terrorist organization with all its power and means. The events we call 'pit actions' also occurred during this period. Turkey is at the same time due to political instability on the one hand and terrorist acts on the other.
It went through a difficult test in the grip of harassment at its borders at the time. Thank God, we came out of all these tests with flying colors. We re-established political stability by successfully carrying out the renewal of elections. Turkey has been a democracy and
The AK Party government, which worked to strengthen the economy, regained the climate of stability and trust.
With the struggle we waged with our soldiers, police and village guards, we buried the separatist terrorist organization in the holes it opened. We are in the final stages of preparations for a comprehensive operation to completely eliminate threats to our borders from Syria.
we came. We have made serious progress in eliminating FETO from the public, business world and civil society activities. It was at this stage that Turkey faced the biggest treason attempt in its history.
My brothers;
There is no doubt that the July 15 coup attempt is one of the biggest attacks against Turkey and the Turkish nation, it is not ordinary. FETO member terrorists dressed in military uniforms turned our country into the hands of the nation with the weapons entrusted to their honor by the state.
They attempted to invade. Just as it started with a great betrayal that night, it ended with a story of great heroism the next day. Imagine, with a struggle that our nation waged at the cost of its life, this nation did not sleep until the morning for 29 days in 81 provinces.
What was this? It was to protect his country, his nation, he said 'I will not sleep' day and night, but he could not sleep.
This failed coup attempt contains lessons for all of us that we cannot obtain in any other way. What might happen to us if the fight against terrorist organizations, especially FETO, is not carried out decisively and quickly?
We all saw it together on July 15. Now some say, here it is right or wrong, this or that, etc.
Dear friends; One way or another, but let's know for a fact that there is no other organization in Turkey where taqiyya is carried out so successfully. They hide themselves very well. And we can no longer stand here and wonder, 'I wonder what this person said, what that person said'.
There is a judiciary in the country, there is a legal system and the judiciary is working, the law is working, whatever is necessary will be done. From time to time I tell my friends, there may be people who come in front of you and shed tears. I believe this: If we feel sorry, we can become miserable,
We need to see this fact too.
We have seen the practices, we have seen what has happened, such a coup attempt against this nation, against this state has no precedent in the world. And that terrorist leader in Pennsylvania states that he rules 170 countries from there. While stating that he governed 170 countries
As of now, nearly 75 thousand students are educated in charter schools in America alone, and their annual income has climbed to 700-750 million dollars. And where does this resource come from? This source is made by the government in America itself. It's so random
Can such money and such payment be given to everyone? It can't be done. We need to find answers to all these question marks.
Likewise, we look at the developments in Europe, in Germany, it is a disaster. All kinds of support is given to them there, and also to the PKK. So, why are these given? It is given to prevent Turkey from getting stronger. If one of my ministers cannot get a flight permit
If he cannot go to Europe, we need to find an answer to this question. Now what does he say? They say, 'Well, what will we do next?' It is obvious what you have done so far; What does it mean to say 'what will we do next'? Oh, you have something to do next,
what's that? You have no choice but to open these chapters that you have not opened before. If you open this, good luck, if you don't, good bye. Türkiye is not their custodian. And whatever has been said so far has come true.
Now, I received news yesterday that there is a NATO Summit coming soon and there are meeting requests there. So? They counted 5 items from top to bottom. I look at those 5 articles, 'Turkey must take the first step, the state of emergency must be lifted.' Well? This should be, this should be…
Go through them and tell me what you will do. You go first and lift the state of emergency in France. You will not lift it, you will lift our state of emergency. How will we fight this war against terrorism? 10 to 15 terrorists were killed there in France, that's why
They declared a state of emergency. We have a coup attempt to destroy the state, we have 249 martyrs and 2193 veterans. We will not be able to declare a state of emergency, we will get permission from the gentlemen; Is that possible? Therefore, the only thing we will tell them is; these chapters first
You will handle it, you will keep your promises, then we will sit at the table and talk. Otherwise, we have nothing left to discuss with you.
Of course, the Euphrates Shield Operation that we launched in Syria is truly a process full of success for our Armed Forces and our Intelligence Organization. Especially the Jarablus operation was very successful and DAESH was defeated from there.
has been banished. Then Rai, then Dabık, then Bab, all these operations continued successfully and DAESH was expelled from there. And now, next in line is Manbij and, as you know, dear friends, Raqqa.
Of course, the goal here is what do we do with the coalition forces, especially America? We have a day trip to Russia tomorrow, we will discuss these in detail with Mr. Putin. I hope that we will return from there with a good result. on the 16th
We have a trip to America, where we will discuss all these issues in detail and if we can handle them as a whole and hopefully start a new process from here, I hope that a new era will begin in Syria and even Iraq.
steps are taken.
Ultimately, of course, what will we do on a national and international basis against all the common goals of FETO, PKK, DAESH and other terrorist organizations? The aim is to divide this country, we will know it. This means disintegrating the nation, collapsing this state, that's it.
What do we and our nation say against this? One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state, these four basic principles are very important for us.
Now, my request from all my friends is this: We must do whatever we can to ensure the unity of our nation against those who want to disintegrate and divide our nation. I know that you made a lot of effort and rushed around all over Turkey for April 16.
You worked hard. We now need to crown this work in 81 provinces with the understanding of one nation, we have to achieve this. We will be one nation, including Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Bosnians, Roma, etc., and it is our duty to achieve this.
in the first degree. We embrace it, we will embrace it, but not everyone has to come to this pool of ours. I always say, lovers, did everyone accept their lover's invitation? It didn't. Who are we? But we make our call, we make our invitation; what comes comes,
We have nothing to say to those who do not come.
Two, one flag. An alternative flag to our flag can never be considered. And those who look at those rags with that intention, I'm sorry, we don't look at them with that intention, we do the same to them as necessary. That's why PYD, YPG, their ambitions in northern Syria
We will leave it at that, and everyone should know that. And we will cut our own belly; There is no help or support from anyone else. What will we do then? We will cut our own belly.
Three, one homeland, no one can divide this 780 thousand square kilometer homeland, no one should make such an effort and enthusiasm. This homeland, with its 780 thousand square kilometers, is ours and the only homeland. That's why what was the promise we made when we came 15 years ago?
'Whatever is in the west will be in the east and southeast, whatever is in the north will be in the south.' Have we done these? We did it, we did it in education, we did it in health, we did it in justice, we did it in security, we did it in transportation, we did it in energy, we did it in food and agriculture, we did it in all of them.
We did it, and we still continue to do it. Who would have thought 15 or 20 years ago that a Saladin Eyyubi Airport would be built in Hakkari? But we did it. Who would say Iğdır, who would say Kars, who would say Ağrı; This government did these things.
Why? He did it so that there would be no discrimination in this country, he did it so that there would be no separatism, therefore no one can evaluate the AK Party as separatist or present it as separatist.
The servants of the West can come here, wander around Diyarbakır, here and there, and then say the following: 'There is separatism and discrimination in Turkey.' Never; They are the real divisiveness and discrimination. Why? These are my citizens over there.
They do not oppress. Here you go, as you know, they first hung a giant banner in front of the Parliament in Switzerland, they pointed a gun at my temple, now they have taken another step. They threw paint on all the windows of our Consulate General in Zurich and hit the bus stops in the surrounding area.
They wrote articles calling Erdogan ""death"".
So, where is the Swiss police, what do they do? If there is a Swiss Embassy or Consulate in Turkey, would we allow such a thing? We never did, and never have. If there was even a small movement, our security forces' first job would be there.
It's about taking precautions, we've always looked at it that way. Because we have seen all of them as trusts, but unfortunately we have not seen or found the reward in the same way.
Despite all this, it is not in vain that our nation defends these values ​​at the expense of its life. And four, one state... We do not have such an understanding of a state within a state. We cannot and will never have an understanding of a state other than the Republic of Turkey. If you remember,
It is the result of this wisdom that our nation accompanied us with tears when we shouted 'you will not succeed' right after the coup attempt. Millions of people who filled the streets and squares on the night of July 15 said that their flag could not be lowered and the call to prayer could not be silenced.
While saying that his country cannot be invaded and risking his life for this cause, he has also increased his responsibility on us many times, and that is why our burden is heavy. On this occasion, for the survival of our nation and state, we will fight against the night of July 15 and terrorism.
May God have mercy on all our martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the fight, I wish health to their relatives, I remember our veterans with gratitude and wish them a recovery.
Dear friends;
Undoubtedly, the last and most important test of the period when we were legally distant from the AK Party was the April 16 referendum. Türkiye did not come to the April 16 date out of the blue, it is an issue we have been talking about for years. This issue is a management system discussion
We always said it was. If you look at it from this perspective, it has a history of 200 years, and if you look at more recent developments, it has a history of 10 years. For Turkey, the transition to a parliamentary system was a choice made during the Ottoman period, and this choice was insisted on during the Republic period as well.
Thus, it came to 2007. No one has the right to portray this long period of coups, memorandums, coalitions, crises and chaos as a rose garden without thorns.
When the system was blocked once again in 2007, it became clear that things would not go on like this anymore. The strangeness of 367, which was imposed despite the Constitution, customs and clear provisions, has led to the beginning of a process that is exactly the opposite of what was intended. That year, Türkiye only had its Parliament
Not only did it renew the election process, but it also changed the method of electing the president. In fact, the day this decision was made is the day the management system in Turkey actually changed. On April 16, this decision was put into practice and incorporated into the constitution.
There cannot be two rulers anywhere in the world, both elected by the people and both endowed with executive powers. In our country, presidents are perceived by the coup administrations as guardians of tutelage and are more than symbolic.
was equipped with powers beyond that. This distortion has brought the president to a completely different position with the radical change of the management system. During the referendum campaign, we talked as much as we could about what this system was and what benefits it would bring to our country.
We tried to explain it to our nation.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank all 50 million citizens who exercised their democratic rights on April 16. There is nothing like this in the world, an evaluation with over 85 percent participation. We started this historical transformation by saying 'yes' to the constitutional amendment.
I would like to express my special gratitude to nearly 25 million 200 thousand citizens who contributed. But on this occasion, I would like to thank those who said 'no' for their efforts to exercise their democratic rights. But our gratitude to them is
At the very least, it probably requires their gratitude to those who said 'yes'. Whether it happens or not, it doesn't really matter, we are continuing on our path anyway.
Let me say this loud and clear here: 51.4 percent is not an AK Party vote. But let me also say this: 48.6 percent is not a CHP vote, so no one should deceive anyone. We have local elections ahead of us, hopefully the Parliament in November 2019.
and there is a presidential election, everything will become clearer there.
Therefore, those who apply to every place in Turkey - I don't know who their natural guides are - we know that the Supreme Election Board is the final decision-making authority; But you go to the Supreme Electoral Council, the Supreme Electoral Council makes the final decision. You
You are not satisfied with that, you say Constitutional Court, in the meantime the Constitutional Court makes a statement, you give up hope from there, and now you go to the ECHR. Well, the ECHR does not have such a duty, there is no such thing within its field of duty, and this country has no such duty.
It has no authority to interfere in relevant internal affairs.
Of course, the defeated wrestler cannot get enough of defeat. So be patient, look, we have elections in 2019, prepare well for that election, enter the hearts of the people and the people will reserve a place for you in their hearts, but they do not do this. You are still looking at Turkey, how much Türkiye is there?
If there are enemies, terrorists, they go to their doorstep and unfortunately, they lose their level enough to continue their campaign with the terrorists.
I would especially like to point out that the vote cast on April 16 and the yes vote were a record in Turkish democracy. Our democracy proved its maturity with the blood of our nation on July 15 and with the strong will they reflected at the ballot box on April 16.
From now on, we want everyone who expresses their opinion about our democracy to take this fact into consideration. From our perspective, both legally and in terms of its place on our nation's agenda, April 16 is now behind us. From now on, we will focus all our energy on
We have to focus our attention and make our plans according to the 2019 elections. We give the same advice to other parties as well.
Dear friends;
I find it useful to briefly reiterate the lessons that all these experiences have given us: If we learn from our experiences, it is inevitable that we will encounter similar problems again tomorrow. If we wish our nation's support to us to continue,
If we want to, we should not make such a mistake. For this reason, we have no right to tolerate any terrorist organization. We have no right to waste even a single penny of this country. What needs to be done for the peace, prosperity and future of our nation
We have no right to postpone or neglect any work.
I am saying this, of course, we do not have mayors here today, we have ministers, but I believe they are watching on television, we need to pay attention to this in our service: Service is necessary, but service is not enough, what matters is enough.
is to do what is. What is enough? What is enough is to enter the hearts of our people and win their hearts.
We have no right to be complacent or, above all, to deviate from our nation's course. We are providing great services. Thank God, our AK Party has made unprecedented investments in the history of the Republic in 15 years, and we will continue to do so. Infrastructure, superstructure, all
We will do this in everything, education, health, all these areas, and there is no obstacle in front of us not to do this. We have this power. Otherwise, we will be ashamed of our martyrs, ashamed of our veterans, and ashamed of our children.
My dear brothers and sisters;
This poor person doesn't want to be embarrassed, and I believe you don't want to be embarrassed either. So we will work, we will work harder, we will work more sincerely, we will work more efficiently, we will reach more people, we will make ourselves known to those who have not heard of us,
We will introduce ourselves to those who do not know us.
We stayed up late one night, we walked around the Ani Ruins, we were with Recep Akdağ Bey and so on. On the way back, I said, 'Mr. Recep, let's build a roof door like this.' We went out and built a roof door like this. Of course, the landlady, the bride and her daughter were all surprised when they saw us. We said 'master of the house'
Isn't there?' 'The gentleman is with the herds right now,' he said. Turns out he was a shepherd. I said, 'Well, do you have anything you can offer us?' 'What do you mean, Prime Minister, here you go,' he said, opened the door, and immediately let us in. And as you know, the tandoor is ready, cheese, honeycomb honey, they came immediately,
tea has arrived. But in the meantime, he immediately calls his master on the phone and says, 'Mr., look, we have the President.' And he says, ""Take a good look."" Anyway, he gave us the phone, I said, 'Where are you, near or far?' He said, 'I'm far away, Prime Minister.' I said, 'Then don't get tired, come to us lady.
He provides the necessary hospitality here.' Indeed, the hospitality, honor and conversation were abundant and beautiful.
We went out, before coming to the city I said, 'Let's knock on one more door'; We built another roof door. They, the owner of that house, were there. And the landlady immediately instructed the daughter-in-law to serve coffee, and our daughter dropped the coffee while bringing it and cut her hand. I'm Recep too
I said to Mr., 'Take him to the hospital immediately.' I guess that hospital was one of the newly built hospitals at that time. Mr. Recep took him to the hospital, anyway, he had stitches etc., but they still gave us their treats.
What will I say? What I will say is: These people are our people. I don't know if they are Kurds, Zazas, this or that, or anything like that. And we need to spread this understanding. We won't stop, we'll live from door to door, special invitation
no. Let's go to those who have money and leave the others aside. Those who have money already have everything, so there is no need. But let's go to the others, they are the ones who mostly walk with us. Shall we postpone the others? No, I don't mean that either. However,
The sincerity here is not there. That's why, let's go as if we were lucky enough to win the lottery. And this is a completely different excitement, a completely different pleasure, let's do this and tell the truth to those who think us wrong.
Of course, we will not neglect any segment of society, we will pay special attention to young people and women in particular. That's why the task of our women's branches is very heavy, very important, as well as young people... For this, we will constantly renew ourselves. Reaching young people
We will make whatever innovations we need to make. We will do whatever is necessary to win the hearts of women. I would also like to thank my wife, Ms. Semiha, in your presence. Of course, I would also like to thank the wives of all our minister friends,
We would like to thank our fellow MPs and female MPs, as well as their spouses.
We support and will support all segments of society, from workers to businessmen, from tradesmen to farmers, for the growth, development and progress of our country. We will further increase our growth rate. We will increase our production and exports. We are increasing employment and we will increase it.
We will reduce inflation even further with God's permission. But in the meantime, we will definitely reduce interest rates. I always say; Interest-inflation is a matter of cause and effect. Interest is the reason, inflation is the result, that's why we will take this step. Will complete existing projects quickly,
We will put new ones into operation immediately.
Especially our defense industry projects are of critical importance for us. In this field, any project that does not contribute to our country with high technology is not reliable for us. In our meetings with Mr. Modi yesterday during his trip to India, especially information technology,
We discussed the software etc. with them. They even took serious steps in space technology. They said, 'We can take joint steps with Turkey, we will.' Hopefully we will chase these too.
Our experiences in the fight against terrorism and Syrian operations have shown that becoming a self-sufficient country in all areas of the defense industry is our most strategic priority. In addition to these, in education, health, justice, security,
We have important progress to make in urbanization and social assistance.
As you know, the AK Party did not give up on two issues in the most difficult period; One of these is to observe the balance of freedom and security, and the other is to never give up our priorities and investments in the economy. Today, the attacks of the world's most bloody terrorist organizations
This understanding is behind why we are a country that continues its struggle within democracy and law despite being exposed to violence. Likewise, although we are surrounded by a wall of fire and attempts are made to create similar images within ourselves, our growth figures,
This is the secret of why we are still at the forefront with our large investments. We will not give up our sensitivities on democracy, law and investments in the coming years.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Our companionship and camaraderie with you is not hanging by a thread. Our conversation does not change direction with the wind. Because our brotherhood is the brotherhood of the afterlife, we will look at it that way. Our friendship in the cause is a tablet from the eternal beings.
It is written in pen, we will look at it that way. But being a man of cause is not easy either. What does the master say:
“Alas, alas, Sakaryam, did this burden fall on you?
This cause is contemptible, this cause is orphan, this cause is great!..
What a difficult test is Sakarya!
How does a canary carry a thousand-headed eagle?
I thought the porter of the sacred load was human.
Porterhood, in the end, there is neither rank nor property,
And separation, from mother, from homeland, from friend.”
Such a journey... We aspired to carry this cause, even if we were despised and orphaned. What does our Lord say? What did man do with the burden that even the mountains could not bear? Uploaded. Now we need to give credit for this together. Nobody forced us to do this. Each of us
We embarked on this difficult path with our own will and choice. In the end, the path we set out on, without hoping for rank, position, wealth, or calculating anything, brought us here. A man goes to the haunt with his intention and from there to the grave; this is the journey. Of course this heavy burden
There were, and will be, those who could not bear it. We condemn them to non-existence and leave their evaluation to our nation. It is also a fact that; So far, we have not seen anyone who turned his back on this cause, this party and prospered.
Hopefully, we will continue on our way by tightening our ranks even more in our future work. I believe that our party will emerge stronger from our extraordinary congress to be held on May 21. Taking advantage of the ordinary congress process, we achieved this strengthening from below.
We must continue upwards and determinedly. We have no time to waste. Our road is long, our duty is heavy. To make good use of the period until 2019, when first the local elections and then the Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held.
We have to.
May God open our path and our fortune. May God give us strength and strength on the path of serving God and the people. May God make our companionship and camaraderie everlasting. As I conclude with these thoughts, I feel that rejoining my family is
I offer my love and respect to all of you with the joy, excitement and happiness of being together with you again under the same roof. I would like to thank each of you from the bottom of my heart for your conversation, enthusiasm, and keeping the promise. I entrust you all to God, stay healthy.
",2023-04-16,The Presidential Government System was introduced: Changing the law and banning the party regulation of presidents,after
37. Their Speech at the Meeting with Mukhtars,2017-04-05,"

Our dear headmen,
My precious brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation.
We are together with you at the 37th of our Mukhtars meeting. As you can see, we do not do this occasionally, we always come together with our headmen. But this time we extended the break a little, you know, the campaign. We haven't been able to get together for almost 2 months. But we said, let's wrap this up now, because we used to come together with an average of 400 muhtars every week, but this time, we said let's do this job in Gazi Social Complex. We held our last headman meeting on February 8.
Today, we are holding a very different muhtars' meeting in terms of venue, number and provincial distribution. We held our first 36 meetings in the meeting room in the main building of our Social Complex and had our meal in the winter garden. Today, we come together at the Congress and Culture Center, which is an important part of our Social Complex. Normally, depending on the capacity of the hall in the main building, we would come together with 400 and sometimes up to 450 mukhtar brothers from 10-12 provinces, today we are together with 2 thousand mukhtar brothers from 81 provinces. This time, our Minister of Internal Affairs will host the meal on my behalf. Since the structure of our Congress and Culture Center is not suitable for such an organization, hopefully this meal will be served at the Gölbaşı Provincial House under the supervision of our Minister after our meeting. Unfortunately, we will not be able to attend this dinner this time as we will attend a mass opening ceremony in Bursa right after our meeting.
Of course, our main goal is to build a huge place behind the mosque, in the lower part, right in the background. Once the multi-purpose hall comes into service, we will continue our meetings there with dinner. Because our hall is being built there where around 2 thousand people can eat at the same time, and our construction is progressing rapidly. Hopefully, those meetings will be very, very different. Because bringing all our brothers together, eating together and chatting together will be a means of bonding and getting to know each other; We will have this opportunity.
The building we are in is a veteran place. We have 29 martyrs and 36 veterans in this area during the July 15 coup attempt. And this is how this veteran place will be recorded in history. During the July 15 coup attempt, our building was exposed to the fire of the coup plotters and was bombed with F16s on the road right in front of us. It came under fire in the same way as helicopters. We must keep these memories alive in our memory record so that Turkey never experiences such dark nights again. I pray that God protects our country from such attacks and betrayals.
My brothers;
Türkiye will go to the polls for a very important election in 11 days. The subject of the election is the known Constitutional amendment. When we look at it on the face of it, there is an acceptance or rejection of an 18-article Constitutional amendment. However, this referendum is of historical importance in terms of its content and will change the management system of our country. Especially the biggest feature of the new system; It increases the power of the national will, that is, your will, over the country's administration. As people who came to office directly with the vote of the people, you know very well what this means. Consider the services that a headman, equipped with the powers of the district governor and mayor, can bring to his neighborhood. We are making a similar change on April 16.
My brothers;
But there are people who do not understand this, the head of the main opposition does not understand this. Here he is giving a speech recently, what does he say? 'This President may close the muhtars' offices on April 17.' Believe me, I have never seen such a lie detector. First of all, he doesn't even know how headmen are elected. The headman is elected the same way Tayyip Erdoğan was elected, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, there is no difference between us. The nation chose me and you, too, right?
Now he says; 'He issues a decree and closes you down.' Well, the headmen did not come with a decree, the headmen came with a legal regulation, what comes with a legal regulation goes away with a legal regulation. And do you know where that legal regulation is based? The Constitution is such a structure. So don't just call him headman. But unfortunately, this gentleman underestimates the headman.
Look, I am speaking at the United Nations Meeting, and he is speaking here. Very interesting, “As a citizen and as the leader of the main opposition party, when Tayyip Erdoğan was speaking at the United Nations Meeting, I felt ashamed. ""It is not clear whether he is speaking to world leaders or headmen."" Look, I just had it removed from the records.
Now he is holding a meeting with the muhtars here, about 40 muhtars and one of our muhtars come out and say, ""You evaluated our President's speech at the United Nations in this way, as a muhtar, I was disturbed by it."" Whatever he says, you will like it; 'Is it our place?' Well, you said it, it's on the record. Now the world is such that you become a prisoner of every word that comes out of your mouth. There is a saying in Arabs: ""The secret is valid until it comes out of your mouth, once it comes out, you become its prisoner."" Now look, all of these are on record. Now there is a thing called the internet, everything is on record. Now I say to my Private Secretary, 'just like that, let me do some research and get these out'; It immediately spills out. Everything he talked about, from A to Z, is revealed, down to the date and time.
And he says 'he will close the restaurants'; Repentance, repentance... What does the president have to do with the restaurant? Besides, he doesn't know that mechanism, you know? If there is such an authority to close the restaurant, it is the municipalities, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, learn this too. I served as Mayor and I know these things well. So no one knows what they do. How can such a political party, and even the main opposition, be handed over to such a person in this country?
My dear friends, in democracies, the opposition is very important and if the opposition makes a really smart and serious opposition, it will bring power to the government. But if the opposition does not do its opposition correctly, both itself and the country will lose. What are we doing, we are combining the Presidency and the Prime Ministry. But what does he say? What about friends, do we have any records here? Come on, let us hear it like this.
Now, of course, there is such a fact that the door of the Presidency has never been open to headmen throughout history? But for the first time, this brother of yours opened the door of the Presidential Complex to muhtars, and so far I have hosted 16 thousand muhtars in the Complex, on behalf of my nation. We ate our meals together, took pictures every year, then we gave our gifts and sent them away.
(CHP Chairman Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's statement in an interview with a radio channel was played: “If you lose your impartiality, if you become impartial, this system will not work, and then there will be a fight. Think about it, we established the new model, the people elected the president, and the prime minister became someone else. The President If the president of another party is the leader of another party and the prime minister is the leader of another party, the real fight will break out then, we need to think about that. If the president is impartial, the prime minister will respect his impartiality and take his warnings into consideration. But if the president is sided, the prime minister will be the leader of another party. ""The president is the leader of another party, then the real fight will break out."")
What did you understand? My brothers, this is the problem. Well, we are merging the Presidency and the Prime Ministry in order to avoid this fight, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, do you understand? We experienced these very hard. Oh, it didn't happen in our time; Why? We come from the same school, and because we come from the same school, this did not happen neither with Mr. Gül nor during my Presidency. However, even though they came from the same school, Mr. Sezer and the late Ecevit, think about the incident of throwing the constitutional booklet, even they got into an argument and the next day the economy was in turmoil. So, who will pay for this? People.
My dear brothers and sisters;
April 16 is the name of the system that will eliminate these, so it is very important. And the government went through such coalitions, bargaining and fighting. Some of you remember the famous Güneş Motel negotiations. How were the negotiations made there, how were the ministries given and distributed there? As far as I remember, 13 ministries were disbanded there, these things happened, and these happened with money.
And now the government will not be formed in the Parliament; Or where will it be installed? It will be established by our nation, by you, directly at the ballot box. What does this mean? Do you give the authority to the president at the ballot box? The President can appoint and establish the parliament not from within the Parliament, but from there, but what he does with the membership of a person he has elected from the Parliament is up to him. What will he do? He will take it from outside. Rahmeti Özal used to say, ""When the cabinet was formed from within the Parliament, I witnessed that the ministers in the cabinet were often at loggerheads, even with their friends from their own party in the Parliament."" Now we want them not to happen. And what will the cabinet do from the outside? He will be formed, that is, he will not have the title of deputy. If he wants, he can do it, that is a separate issue, he will get it from outside. And he will continue to serve his country with this cabinet he established from abroad.
What is very interesting is what he says: ""Can you go to that minister?"" Well, why can't you go? What is the duty of the minister? Service to this country. What is the duty of the President? To run the Council of Ministers. Now, in this process; Tayyip Erdoğan was the Mayor of a city like Istanbul for 4.5 years. He is a person who knows what service is to his people and his city. After that, he served as Prime Minister for 12 years. He knows very well what it means to serve Turkey, this land and this nation. We have been the Presidency for 2.5 years, and we have done this as well, both in terms of relations with the Government and how the service is carried out, alhamdulillah. As Ziya Pasha says: ""The donkey dies and his saddle remains, the man dies and his work remains""; that's the point.
Now we need to go much further, this dress is too tight for us now, we need to go further. As Gazi Mustafa Kemal stated, ""We need to raise Turkey above the level of contemporary civilizations""; this is the thing. Of course, this does not happen with words, it happens with actions. Those before us did this. Friend, we have surpassed those before us, alhamdulillah, but we do not consider even this sufficient. Now the West is starting to admire us. What did he admire about you? Brother, we lined it up over the Bosphorus, we brought the third bridge and placed it there, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, four round trips, four round trips, and a high-speed train in the middle, these are unlike any other. It's not over, we went ahead and built Marmaray under the sea. 200 million people passed through Marmaray under the sea in 3 years. can't know. As you know, our grandfather, the Conqueror, launched the galleys from land to the Golden Horn, our grandfather, the Conqueror, did this, and as his grandchildren, we said let's do it under the sea, so we did it under the sea. We didn't stop there, we took another step and said let's take cars under the sea. What did we do? We built the Eurasia Tunnel. Do cars also pass under the sea now? Passing. We built the Osman Gazi Bridge to the Gulf of Kocaeli, from here we reduce the time between Istanbul and Izmir to 3 hours and 15 minutes.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Now, we laid the foundation of Çanakkale on March 18. And the Çanakkale Bridge is number one in the world, with a distance of 2023 meters between the two towers. But with this bridge, we connect Europe and Asia from a different place in a different way. Why? My brothers, this nation has been oppressed so much, they have oppressed so much, no more. This nation has a glorious history, it has a glorious past, now we have returned to this glorious past, now we are rebuilding and revitalizing it. We will do this with everything, in education, health, justice, security, transportation, energy, food-agriculture, everything.
Now, there is a feature here; two ballot boxes will be presented to our nation in the elections to be held every 5 years. Now what is one of the chests? Presidential ballot box. What's the other one? Deputy. Now I think he's confusing this too. Now, in the local elections, municipalities and headmen will be elected there too. But of course, stability will come to the country when it is done every 5 years. In other words, the state will see the future 5 years later. There is an election in this country after 5 years. The investor will see the future 5 years later, domestically and internationally. Now, do you know what they say to us in our meetings when we go abroad? “Is there a choice?” Wait, it's time to choose. When? At the announced time.
Look, can you imagine that until you came to us, a government was established in this country in 16 months? Of course, there were also governments that lasted 25 days, that is different, I am taking the average. The average is once every 16 months and 48 governments have been established in multi-party life. There is no such example here or there in Europe. But unfortunately, they put the government in and out of that cube like a painter's cube. Can such a thing happen, can there be stability in such a country? But now we have arrived, we have held elections on whatever date has been since we arrived. This is stability, this is trust. What do you do with the economy in a country where there is stability? You triple it. We took the national income per capita from 3500 dollars, where did we increase it? We increased it to 11 thousand dollars. There was no such thing, but there is now.
My dear brothers and sisters;
We took office, what was our debt to the IMF? It was 23 billion 500 million dollars. In 2013, we ended this relationship with the IMF, paid all the debt, and the business was reset. Who got into debt? Those before us borrowed money, and we paid it. In other words, every party has its share in these. CHP has it, Justice Party has it, this one has it, that one has it, they all have it. You know everything, those who make this country dependent on 70 cents are the sinners of this business.
Now, the reserve of our Central Bank was 27.5 billion dollars when we took office. But thank God, these latest exchange rates and so on, our foreign exchange reserves are currently around 110 billion dollars, look, we are here. We are determined, we achieved these with this stability. Now, after the election, the President will govern the country together with his government, and the Parliament will do its main job with the legislative and supervisory duties that belong only to it. If you say, the judiciary will continue to do its duty much more effectively, with impartiality added to its independence.
What does Kılıçdaroğlu say? The others do not speak out anyway. It is very interesting that he says, ""There will be no legislative body either."" Does he say? Says. It's a shame, how can you lie like that? My brothers, the legislative body will be more effective and the legislative body will be equipped with the authority up to the point that the president goes to the Supreme Court. Does it currently have such authority? No. But of course, after April 16, these things do not come into play immediately, you know, there will be a presidential election in 2019 and it is equipped with such an authority, this is the control authority. The rates have been set, and once the majority is achieved at these rates, the President can be referred to the Supreme Court even for personal crimes. At the moment, he only goes to the Supreme Court for treason and treason, but does not go anywhere else. But after November 2019, the president will go to the Supreme Court even for personal crimes; We bring this. Who will do this? The legislature will do it. Who will elect the 7 members of the Board of Judges and Prosecutors? The Parliament did not have such authority until now, but now the Parliament will elect it. Kılıçdaroğlu, didn't you read these 18 articles? It would be a shame if you had reviewed it and studied one of its lessons.
My brothers;
Another name for the work done on April 16 is the continuation of the process started with the 2007 Constitutional amendment. If you remember, Turkey was tried to be dragged into the abyss in 2007 by some forces that saw themselves above the national will. When the presidential election was completely blocked by coercive methods, where did we, the greatest referee, go? We went to the nation. While the parliamentary elections were being renewed, we also said to our nation; 'Let's save Turkey from this trouble completely.'
For this reason, we proposed that the Presidential election be held directly at the ballot box, not in the Parliament, which is open to all kinds of pressure and manipulation. We could only do so much under the conditions of that period. Thanks to our nation that year, they both gave us power with 47 percent and accepted this change with 69 percent. When was the first presidential election held under the new system? It was held on August 10, 2014. Essentially, the change on April 16 should have been made at least then. But Turkey has experienced so many incidents in a row, from the Gezi Events to the December 17-25 police-judiciary coup attempt, that such an opportunity did not exist. The July 15 coup attempt showed that this need could no longer be postponed or postponed.
Now, with the agreement of the AK Party and the Nationalist Movement Party in the Parliament; I would like to thank both chairmen very much and I would also like to thank the members of parliament who acted together with their chairmen. Because this solidarity, thank God, showed that what was said could not be done was done and the referendum decision was taken with 339 votes.
Dear brothers and sisters,
As can be seen now, our new management system did not fall from the sky, it has come to show itself after a long process. If you think back, wasn't this your brother who voiced this issue day and night, both during the 2011 elections and the June 7 elections, and asked for support from our nation? I've always said this. In fact, I have voiced this in my agenda since the time I was the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. The system of metropolitan municipalities is partly similar to the presidential system. I have discussed this proposal in all the sessions since then, and it is today.
There may be some omissions today. In fact, some people come out and say, 'I like the Turkish type presidential system', and they are disturbed by this. What was I going to say? Don't we have our own traditions? We have our own traditions. We have our own understanding of politics from the past, we have our scientific politics, are we going to put these aside? We will benefit from all this. This nation has a history, you see in our history, we have a Nizam al-Mulk and when you look at his work, you see how he expressed scientific politics and how he gave way to a presidential system there. We will evaluate all of these, we will take our share from all of them, wherever there is in the world, just like a honey bee, but not like a wasp, like a honey bee, we will make our honey; this is the thing.
The fact that the main opposition party is approaching the issue as if they are seeing it for the first time in their lives is enough to show how disconnected they are from the realities of the country and the nation. During my term as Prime Minister and Chairman, I commissioned broader studies on this issue and we had all the products of these studies. In this last period, our friend appointed from MHP and our friend appointed from AK Party came together and carried out these studies and a point was reached. Now is not the time to talk, now is the time for the nation to make the final decision at the ballot box and this prepared honey was offered to the nation. The main opposition speaks, we do it; This is our difference.
Now the head of the main opposition denigrates July 15 and tortures the souls of our martyrs. See what he says? It's very ugly, look at this statement, it says 'July 15 is a covert coup'. Where did you get the authority to insult our martyrs? If it is a covert coup, if you have an iota of dignity, if you have an iota of personality, come out and present your files, and we will do what is necessary. I have neither been deceived nor deceived in my political life, and we will neither be deceived nor deceiving from now on; This is our understanding. But be honest, be truthful, do not lie to this nation.
You say 'covert coup attempt'. When I landed in Yeşilköy late that night, thousands of my brothers at Atatürk Airport heeded the call and came there. They said, if I'm not mistaken, around 11:30, 'Kılıçdaroğlu came and left.' Why did you leave there? Then we learned that he went to the Bakırköy Mayor's house. What if you had stayed among the people? You know, you used to say, 'When there is a coup, I will be the first one on the tank.' You know, the tanks were there, where were you? This cannot be done with words, this can be done with heart. Look, 36-year-old Sabri throws himself under the tank, the tank passes over him, he gets up, the second tank comes, he throws himself under the second tank, his arm and leg are broken; But he comes out of there as a brave veteran. Sabri or Kılıçdaroğlu now? Sabri, Sabri... This is the point, we will do this.
""To gush Martyrs land tighter the şüheda! / May God take away my soul, my soul, all that I have, / May the world not destroy me from my only homeland. that's the point. And these lands became a homeland by kneading them with the blood of martyrs, but they did not become a homeland out of the blue. Look, we had 3 martyrs in Gabar yesterday. May God have mercy on them, our condolences to their relatives and our nation. But we made them pay the price by neutralizing 20 terrorists, and we will make them pay. I would like to thank our Armed Forces, our Minister, our General Director of Security, our Gendarmerie General Command, all of them in your presence. This struggle continues in this way.
And a member of parliament appears from behind and talks about throwing the unfortunate 'yes' voters into the sea in Izmir. So who are you? First know your place. They won't let you into Samsun, they won't let you into Amasya, they won't let you into Sivas. Know your place, you can't walk there. Rude guy, is this nation Greek? We threw the Greeks into the sea, you will throw those who said 'yes' in this country into the sea. Do you have the strength to stand?
My brothers, their chairman comes out and says, 'I don't find it right.' Don't say you don't find it right, you immediately throw this man out with a demand for expulsion, if you can't, this CHP will go. What is this? This is called separatism, this is called disintegrating this country. We are clearing this country of such separatists, this is our difference. But we will not throw those who say 'no' into the sea. I hope we will establish a special symbolic politics museum for those who say 'no' and exhibit the objects there. Why? There came a time when we will say, look, there were those who said 'no', and their theses were these and these. This is how we understand democracy, and this is how we talk and do politics. What does pouring into the sea mean? For us, 80 million is respectable in this country. We respond with understanding to the speeches and criticisms of those who say 'no', but we do not throw it into the sea. Did I go to their tents? I went. Why did I go? I understand that, anyone who says yes, that's my thesis anyway.
Dear brothers and sisters,
All these works we have created, do 80 million people benefit from them? It does. Do Alevis and Sunnis benefit from these? It does. We are for unity, we are for solidarity, we are for brotherhood, we are all Turkey together; that's the point. There is more nonsense that we can't hear anymore, and I don't know them either. When it comes to words, they do not leave democracy, libertarianism and populism to anyone, but they do not respect or trust the people's choices and will in the slightest. As I said, we will put these leftover politicians of the single party era, the last of their kind, in a museum. Saying more about these is a waste, and in our belief, waste is haram.
My brothers,
Some people think that the new management system we will pass if the April 16 referendum is accepted is an ordinary change. However, we are taking an important step towards moving up to the next league as a country by ensuring stability and trust with our new management system. Currently, the 65th government is in charge of Turkey, if we take it from 1920, and the 48th government, if we take it from 1950. If the government was established every 5 years and Turkey continued on its path in stability, today it would be governed by its 19th, or perhaps even its 20th, government. This is stability. But what did they do with this stability? They eliminated it; 65 where, 19-20 where…
If you ask what is the harm in establishing so many governments, my answer is that it has great harm. Without going back to the 1920s or anything, let me give an example from more recent history that almost everyone here can remember; Has a coalition frenzy started in Turkey since the 1991 elections? Did this trend continue until the AK Party came to power in November 2002? Do you know how much this craze, which included the 1994 and 2001 crises, cost Turkey? Let me tell you this and see where this situation hits with numbers. If we, as a country, had been governed steadily by strong governments without interruption since 1991, we would be twice as high as where we are today, that is, the national income per capita would be 22 thousand dollars, not 11 thousand dollars. This money was stolen from the pockets of every individual of this nation. So where did he go? Of course, it went into the pockets of profiteers, usurers and speculators.
The same thing happened in the Gezi events, they did the same thing there too. We remember the days when interest rates in Turkey rose to 7500 percent overnight, right? These were made to order. And when these interest rates rose to 7500 percent overnight, who paid for this? My nation paid. Isn't it a shame for this nation? We are trying to bring to our country a management system that will guarantee an environment of stability and trust so that no one can steal money from our nation's pockets again. Likewise, we haven't forgotten what happened in the June 7, 2015 elections, when we couldn't get the majority to form a government on our own, right? Using my authority, we immediately decided to hold an election, and my nation showed up with its foresight and gave the authority to a sole government again and again on November 1st.
We remember how terrorist organizations and the forces behind them attacked our country like hyenas, right? Trenches, oh my God; With what tools does he do these? With the opportunities provided to them by the state, they get up and open those places with those graders. Those tunnels, they threaten, they enter houses, they build cities with tunnels under houses. My minister told me that the men built an underground city that could accommodate 1500 people. But what happened? Our soldiers and police detected them, mounted them, entered their lairs and finished them off there.
Now, the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, my brothers, we are establishing a system that operates strongly in its own lanes. That's why we say strong Turkey, that's why we say great Turkey, that's why we say prosperous Turkey, that's why we say stable Turkey, that's why we want a yes vote on April 16.
My brothers;
There are those who love Tayyip Erdoğan, there are those who do not, I respect them all. But I believe that everyone agrees that it is not possible for Tayyip Erdoğan to attempt anything against Turkey and the Turkish nation. Oh, let me tell you who doesn't like me. The separatist terrorist organization does not like me, FETO does not like me, profiteers do not like me, DAESH does not like me, some leaders of the West do not like me at all, and those who put a portrait in front of the Swiss Parliament and point a gun at my temple do not like me. It is not possible to expect such a thing from them anyway.
My dear brothers and sisters;
We don't expect them to love anyway. It is enough for our people to love us, to accept us as God, and to gain His consent. We are after something; why? To gain the consent of our Lord, to gain the consent of our people. We will die tomorrow. We will die, what will happen? They will bury it in a 2 cubic meter grave, right? And in the musalla, sir, he will not say 'for the purpose of the President', he will say 'for the purpose of a private', right? Then he will say, 'How did you know?' And what Baki said for us: As he says, ""It turns out that there is a pleasant sound in this dome that remains,"" Alhamdulillah, what we do is a means of this. As long as these works are seen, they will say, 'one day a President came from this country and he and his friends did good works, they built these bridges, they built these schools, they built these hospitals, they built these roads, they built these airports'; Let them say this is enough for us.
My brothers,
When we took office, it was 25, now we have 59 airports. Now, the airport is literally half an hour away. We now take planes for the price of luxury buses in the past, right? What became the airline became the people's way. Mr. Binali was my Minister of Transport, I said, 'look, we will make the airline the people's way, prices, etc. accordingly.' And Turkish Airlines was one, but now there are 6 airline companies, we brought competition. Well, we have a problem, we are in love with this nation, we are troubled, we are in love, we are drilling tunnels and mountains; Why? We will reach. To where? To Ferhat, and Ferhat to Şirin; really? As soon as Ferhat reaches Şirin, the job is over. Cute people, Ferhat and us...
My brothers;
Trying to confuse the nation by making up 180 lies about the 18-article constitutional amendment is not opposition. Türkiye cannot continue on its way with such an opposition approach. I say this: My brothers who are devoted to the AK Party, my brothers who are devoted to the MHP, my brothers who are devoted to the Great Unity Party, all my brothers and sisters who are devoted to the Republican People's Party, my citizens, my brothers who are devoted to the Felicity Party, I call out to all of you: Come. Let's make a national and local alliance together on April 16 and hopefully strive to build and revive this leading country, Turkey, the great Turkey, hopefully in a different way. Let's not be emotional here, let's be casual here. And I believe that with the steps taken in this process, Turkey will experience a very serious leap. Because it suits us and we do it. This nation can do this, I have no doubt about it.
And I think that my brothers who have devoted themselves to CHP do not deserve such a government and such helplessness. The fate of a political approach that is so distant from its people, so alien to the truth, and trapped in the false world it has created will be just like the party cadres in the 1990s. Let me inform you that the end of this understanding will be the same as our nation buried them in the ballot box.
My brothers;
This mentality will be completely eliminated with the introduction of the presidential government system, which requires 50 percent + 1 vote to get out of the ballot box. Those who do not have anything to say to the nation, a project to tell, or a vision to share will no longer have any value in politics. Personally, I feel the need to prepare, develop projects and put forward a vision for the Presidential election to be held in November 2019, and we will work on it. While I participate in mass opening ceremonies in another province and embrace our nation almost every day, I also make these preparations in a corner of my mind and carry out these works with my team.
Otherwise, they wouldn't tell you to 'walk' out of the blue. Just as we took the steps at the Prime Minister's Office, I was the Mayor at that time, what were they saying? 'The Mayor cannot rule the country.' But in our preparations, we went out with everything we had and showed them all how to govern. Then look, do you know what that mentality told me? Remember, he said, ""He can't even become a headman."" Well, this is their mentality, they underestimate the headmanship very much. You must teach them the necessary lesson on April 16. The headman is not a person to be taken lightly, the headman's warning is very strong, let them see this. The era of collecting revenue without working, producing, or taking risks is over. The bar of politics in our country is rising for everyone, from the headman to the President. Competition in the mukhtar position is now increasing. Especially, I have good news to give you a little later. The era of becoming a headman candidate voluntarily, or even by force, as before, is over. A tight race awaits you starting from the first election.
My brothers;
Now we can give our good news. Now, as my sister Havva just said, in the past, when I took office, the salary they paid did not even equal the price of 2-3 packs of tea. When you say pack, don't understand cigarettes, quit smoking once and for all. Look, you know I am an anti-smoker, quit smoking and help us with this. Our headmen should carry out smoking cessation campaigns. Are we ready for this? Because you oppress your wife and your children in your home. A smoker is an active smoker, a non-smoker is a passive smoker. But who suffers the most? Passive smoker. I want your support in this regard. Let us, as Türkiye, break the burden of this matter? Hookah-margile, let's give them all.
What have we done with a gradual increase? We equalized the salaries of muhtars with the minimum wage. Currently, our headmen receive a salary of 1406 lira. But we said that this is not enough, we also said that they have Social Security Institution premiums and they should also be covered. Hopefully, our relevant institutions have completed their preparations, and we are solving this issue with the first decree law to be published. From now on, the Social Security Institution premiums of our mukhtars, which amount to 613 liras, will be covered by the state. Thus, where do the incomes of our headmen actually go in the form of salaries plus social security premiums? It goes up to 2019 lira. I wish good luck to the headmen of 18296 villages and 31921 neighborhoods serving in our country.
Now, on this occasion, I would like to give good news to our security guards. We increased the salaries of our security guards to 1411 liras, their allowances to 36 liras per day and 1080 liras per month, and also ensured that they were paid 21 liras per day for operation compensation. Our security guards can now be assigned to operations outside their own provinces. In addition to our existing provinces, we also included Erzurum, Erzincan, Hatay and Osmaniye into the security guard system. By increasing the number of staff to 55 and decreasing the average age, we have made our security guards the greatest assistants of our soldiers and police.
Now we are taking another step and making all our security guards insured. Insurance premiums will be paid by our Ministry of Internal Affairs, and our security guards will be able to receive health care wherever they want, just like other insured people. With this practice, in addition to their salaries, allowances and compensation, an insurance payment of 578 lira will be made for each of our security guards. They should also know this. I hope that their insurance will be beneficial to our security guards. I believe that our headmen deserve these opportunities with the services they provide to their neighborhoods and villages, and our security guards with the support they give to our fight against terrorism.
Now, there is something they always tell me at dinners with our muhtars, that guns are guns, guns are guns... Now, of course, he takes the gun and they say; 'Save us from this allowance.' Anyway, we evaluated these with our Prime Minister and in the end, our Government and the Ministry of Internal Affairs cover the allowance, so there is no allowance. Is it OK? I didn't hear 'yes'?
With these feelings, I once again pray to God that April 16 will lead to a bright future for our country and nation. I greet you with love and respect.
",2023-04-16,The Presidential Government System was introduced: Changing the law and banning the party regulation of presidents,before
Their Speech at the 'Presidential System Symposium',2017-02-11,"

Dear members of the Politics, Economics and Social Research Foundation SETA,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, affection and respect. I wish the Presidential System Symposium organized by SETA to be successful. To our valuable academicians who will contribute to the symposium with their speeches and evaluations,
I would like to express my gratitude to our intellectuals in advance. I congratulate SETA executives for this symposium, which was organized at a time when Turkey was on the eve of a historic decision to switch to the presidential system.
Dear friends;
Today, there are nearly 200 countries in the world that are members of the United Nations. The management systems of each of these differ according to their historical, social and cultural characteristics. Although there are various classifications about management systems,
These are just to get a general idea.
For example, when we examine the list of countries governed by the parliamentary system, we see that in practice very different administration styles are gathered under the same heading. Again, a similar situation occurs in countries governed by the presidential system.
We encounter the view. In theory, the parliamentary system is the product of the struggle against monarchy and totalitarianism. When we look at European countries, we see that many of them have kings and queens. In other parts of the world such as Japan and Thailand
Similar situations may be encountered.
Of course, some people will immediately say, 'Sir, these monarchs are symbolic, in fact there is parliamentary democracy there.' If there is an actor in the state administration system, it never remains symbolic. If there is a king in a country, he is the king; if there is a queen, he is the king.
is the queen. The owner of this throne and crown, in one way or another, has the right and has a say in the management and administration of the country. There is no monarchy in countries governed only by a presidential or presidential system. Its name expresses a republic or a similar democratic concept.
There are also governments that are actually ruled by dictatorship, and even resemble monarchies in that positions are passed from father to son. In short, each country has a management style specific to its own conditions.
When we look at our country, we witness that we have had very different experiences one after another in the last 200 years. The uninterrupted searches and turmoil throughout the 18th century brought about many trials from the Tanzimat to the Constitutional Monarchy.
My brothers;
In this process, our country has constantly melted and shrunk due to wars and crises, and has paid a very heavy price. Çanakkale Victory signifies the point where the knife reaches the bone. We fought our War of Independence with the inspiration and strength we received from Çanakkale. Of course, every struggle is
It also paves the way for the choices and orientations of the team that actually carries out the struggle and holds the power. The declaration of the Republic after the success of our War of Independence is the product of such a choice. European countries try to keep monarchy and democracy together
While we were on our way, we took the dynasty out of the country and declared the Republic. Our country has come to this day with first a single-party government system - let's pay attention here - and then a multi-party government system. Main opposition, I am calling out to you; first one-party, then
The multi-party era began.
Dear friends;
The Republican period is not monolithic in itself. For example, there are serious differences between the 1921 Constitution and the 1924 Constitution. The 1961 and 1982 constitutions also contain quite sharp differences compared to the past. Likewise, Gazi Mustafa Kemal's presidency
There are also significant differences in implementation between the party presidency period and the İnönü period. After 1950, when we transitioned to multi-party political life, we always tried to keep our democracy alive under the shadow of coups and tutelage governments. last 14
We felt and experienced all of these troubles in our bones throughout the year.
The fact that we have managed to overcome the problems with the strength we receive from our nation does not eliminate the underlying structural distortions and disorders. The most important result of these distortions; The environment of stability and trust is constantly under threat. political instability
It also brings economic and social problems. While the history of our Republic is 93 years, now - pay attention here - the 65th government is in power, look at the situation. In other words, the lifespan of governments in our country is not even 16 months.
While Turkey was governed by such short-lived governments, it was surpassed one by one by all the countries with which it competed for development, development and growth under similar conditions. There have been governments in this country that lasted 25 days. Can the state be governed like this? This
They tried to manage. Now we are fixing this fundamentally. If the breakthrough movement in the country during this 14-year period had not been caused by our political movement, we would still continue to raise our horseshoes.
Our searches of the last 200 years, our experiences during the Republican period and especially our experiences in recent years show us a truth. If we want to achieve our goals as a country and nation, we must first have a strong, effective, competent and responsible person.
We need a management system that is fully clear.
In fact, the issue of the presidential system that we are talking about today did not emerge in a moment, in a day, or in a year; it has such a deep and thought-provoking background behind it. For example, this issue is definitely not a Republic issue,
The issue is definitely not a democracy issue, nor is it a freedom issue. The system we are discussing is the best solution to the centuries-old survival problem of Turkey and the Turkish nation; that's the point.
Anyone who calls the period from the declaration of the Republic to our transition to multi-party life in 1950 democracy is either deceiving himself or trying to deceive us. The name of this period is single party rule. Hey main opposition, let's first pull yourself into a shelter. in 1950
It would probably not be wrong to state that behind the frequent interruptions of our multi-party life with coups and memorandums is the longing of a certain segment for the single-party period, I explain this here.
Turkey has suffered greatly from tutelage institutions that hold power and authority, but have no responsibility towards the nation. Pay attention, whenever governments based on national will were in power in our country, there were very
Great leaps have been made. Despite this, you must remember very well how much I complained about the bureaucratic oligarchy during my term as prime minister. When we bring together all these experiences, these events we have experienced, and historical readings,
Our country's need for a new constitution and with it a new management system is becoming clear as daylight.
My brothers;
As can be seen, the presidential system we are talking about today has nothing to do with the regime, monopoly, or personality. Then, I will remind you of one thing right away, and that is: I think it is the AK Party that wants provincial heads to be governors in this country.
did not do it or the AK Party did not experience it. Who do these belong to? These all belong to the past of the main opposition party. Provincial heads of the Republican People's Party have also served as governors in this country, both provincial heads and governors; Can such a democracy exist?
How will you explain it? But they did it. They do not want to bring this up at the moment, because it is a black mark for them, and for them it is a very serious stain on the history of democracy.
The issue is an effort to establish a management system that is much stronger, more resilient and more suitable for achieving our goals, in the light of the experiences we have had in the past as a country and nation. The greatest guarantee of the presidential system is the real
is that it is democratic. In this system, anyone who does not have the favor of more than half of our nation has no chance of ruling the country. No ruler who has to be accountable to the nation and the national will should be responsible for those who oppose the presidential system.
There is no possibility of deviating from the mistakes they put forward. If you abandon the path that the nation has shown you, you will be instantly overthrown by the nation.
That's why I say; The particular distrust of those who oppose the system is against the nation, not the person to be elected president; that's the point. Perhaps because they cannot express this truth, they try to confuse people with the lies they produce through individuals.
they are working. They say, 'Your strength is Tayyip Erdoğan'. Well, Tayyip Erdoğan is not eternal, Tayyip Erdoğan is mortal... Is there a guarantee that I will even appear on April 16? Therefore, we are fighting a system struggle here, it is a system struggle.
What will happen after Erdoğan? Whatever the nation says will happen, whatever God says will happen; We will look at it this way.
More importantly, Turkey has already taken its first steps towards this system and completed it successfully. Yes, I am talking about the Constitutional amendment in 2007. Everyone who knows these things more or less knows that April is the month when the president is directly elected by the people.
He will accept that the system introduced by the Constitutional amendment that we will vote in the middle of the day has already started to work. We even go further, stating that Turkey has been governed by a dual-headed system since August 2014, both of which derive their legitimacy directly from the nation.
It should also be seen.
If there are no problems in this process, it is not because the system is working correctly, it is because me and our leaders are in harmony, not because of the system. Therefore, he does not personalize the issue with the constitutional amendment, on the contrary, it has been resolved for more than two years.
We connect the management, which has been running on personal initiatives for a long time, to a system. Unfortunately, we cannot discuss these issues on their real level due to an understanding in our country that thinks opposing everything is opposition.
The details of the constitutional amendment will undoubtedly be discussed in detail throughout this symposium. Our professors and intellectuals, each of whom is knowledgeable in their own fields, will discuss the issue from all aspects and explain it. For this reason, the Constitutional amendment
I do not go into the articles one by one, I only focus on the spirit of the system.
My brothers;
Of course, without the soul, the body is a corpse. In this regard, if we do not explain to our nation the spirit, essence and essence of the matter, the constitutional amendment provisions alone will remain mere dry legal expressions. With this understanding, the presidency will be held until the referendum date, April 16.
As those who say yes to the government system, we must travel every inch of our country, use all communication opportunities and explain the new system.
We said 'of course yes' yesterday in Aksaray. Why? Yes for one nation, yes for one flag, yes for one homeland, yes for one state... Could it be anything else than this? 80 million is one nation, so yes. And it took its color with the blood of our martyr and gained its independence.
Our flag crowned with a crescent and where each star represents a martyr, yes to that. And 'what makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if there are those who die for it.' 780 thousand square kilometers is a single homeland, so yes. And the only state, the Republic of Turkey,
For him yes.
My brothers;
Man is the enemy of what he does not know. I believe that those who currently express their opposition to the presidential system will change their minds when they learn the spirit of the matter. But we know one more thing; Those who say 'no' today, what they say 'no' to
Is he aware? Look, who says 'no'? PKK says 'no'. Who says 'no'? Kandil says 'no'. Who says 'no'? Those who want to divide and disintegrate this country say 'no'. Who says 'no'? Those who oppose our flag say 'no'. Who says 'no'? What
Unfortunately, in this country, he says 'no' to those who oppose what is national and local. So, my brothers, is the main opposition acting together with them now? It does. I hope they will feel better by April 16th.
Dear friends;
This change, this transformation will not be an ordinary event. The essence of the presidential system is that the administration is given directly to the nation, this is the truth of the matter. The president, who will fulfill his executive duty, will be responsible for everything he takes because he will be responsible to the nation from which he derives his power.
He has to keep an eye on the public in every step. Do you know what they say without shame or boredom? 'Parliament will be destroyed, there will be no parliament, there will be no legislature'; Is such nonsense possible? Who did this, where, to which record such a thing was connected,
is there anything like that? No. But of course, lying and walking with lies; This is the understanding. Everything is clear and clear. Isn't there a legislature in countries where presidential systems are implemented today, for example in America? There is. Yes, they are double chamber, ours will not be double chamber, it is single.
It will have cabins; this is the thing. What did we say? Ours will be a Turkish type presidential system, we do not have to be the same.
Two, execution; there is. The president, that is, the president, will represent the executive. He will establish his cabinet, dismiss him when necessary, and make appointments. But to whom will he be held accountable? He will give it to the nation. Some people say that they are disturbed by this and that 'the interpellation is being lifted.'
Good luck, because the governments in this country suffered a lot from this interpellation, and we also suffered a lot. The interpellation mechanism is a mechanism not to activate the Parliament, it is a mechanism to prevent the governments from operating. By removing this obstacle, we will be able to carry out a fast-paced executive branch.
you will see. Hopefully we will achieve this, this is very important. Where will the actual interpellation mechanism work? Could there be a better interpellation that will work before the nation every five years? Did you do something wrong, did you not study well? What do people do? He asks for the bill, 'come on
Friend, you could not run this business, we are putting you aside now, and we are appointing a new team and a new person to run it.'
Now, unfortunately, there are 'those whose conscience hurts'. The members of the parliament probably listened to their conscience and voted for 339. They don't have a conscience, but do you have one? I'm sorry. They are not fair, are you fair? Sorry. there
All parliamentarians are representatives of the nation and they have made their decisions, and they were not satisfied with this decision, they said that on April 16, sovereignty will unconditionally belong to the nation and the nation will decide on the human plan. In this system, no one's miracle is self-evident behavior.
It is not possible to enter into it, make decisions or carry out practices. The currently two heads of the executive, that is, the president and the prime minister, are now united under one name. In this way, our nation can understand who gives authority, who takes responsibility, and therefore, when necessary,
He knows from the very beginning who he will call to account.
The legislative body and the deputies serving there will focus only on their primary work in the new system. We all know that in our country, MPs cannot find time to carry out their legislative duties because they are busy following up on business. One term, two terms, three terms in the parliament
There are MPs who have served for one term but have not made a single bill or a single piece of legislation. With the new system that clearly separates the executive and the legislature, all MPs will focus on the work of the Parliament. Execution in the new system
The president, who is the head, does not have the authority to introduce laws other than the budget. Legislative activities, which until now have largely been carried out with draft laws prepared by the government, are now entirely under the responsibility of MPs. Is there a legislature? Here you go
there is. The fact that it was too closely intertwined with the executive was eroding the prestige of the Parliament and its MPs, but now the lines are becoming clearer. It also raises the reputation of the Parliament to the level it deserves.
The judiciary, which is the most critical institution of state and nation life, is the most worn-out power in our country in recent years. We have unpleasant images in our memories about the judiciary, which could not take a strong stance on the side of democracy during the coup and tutelage periods. February 28
We have seen judges and prosecutors in this country who went to briefings in their robes during the period and handed over the authority they were supposed to exercise on behalf of the nation to a terrorist organization and the charlatan at its head. We will continue our efforts to solve these problems more strongly in the new system.
We will have the opportunity to implement it. What did we add to it with its independence? We added impartiality. With the contribution of the new structure of the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors, the judiciary, which is constitutionally guaranteed, is rapidly gaining the place it deserves in the hearts of our nation.
I think you will reach the position.
Thus, the executive, legislative and judicial powers will focus entirely on their own fields and do their own work, contributing to the construction of a strong and great Turkey. Whoever convinces our nation that he can provide the best service in this construction process, will become the president.
it will happen. The era of those who claim to be populist by insulting the public is now completely over. The oppressive mentality of those who do not see the nation as capable is now history. Young people, you do not know, but let me tell you; Such politicians have come to this country
There were people who said, ""If I put a four-legged - excuse me - donkey in Taksim Square, I would have him elected as a member of parliament."" Now these are history.
Now, where did we reduce the age of 30 to? to 25. I say it as the voting age. Now where do we reduce 25? to 18. The difficult thing is not to be chosen, the difficult thing is to choose. Now we are restating history by reducing voting and being elected to 18, what does this mean?
This nation is the grandchildren of the Conquerors, who closed an era and opened another at the age of 21. We will pave the way for the youth, we will give the youth a horizon, and what will the youth do in this race? They say, 'What about military service?' Look where they are stuck. If Parliament
If he can enter, he will be exempt from military service, it's that simple. Look, we now, for example, our police officers have always done military service, you know. We abolished this during my term as Prime Minister, we said that he was already doing military service. such an important institution as the Parliament
If a young man is serving somewhere, you can exempt him from military service, that's all, we'll bring it.
Do you know what all these are? These are steps that express the importance of these tasks, these are important steps. And there's no point in pre-blocking it with something. If we really want to overcome obstacles, they can be easily overcome. If you remember, I have a statement; 'the country
I would say, 'I am under the director's account, like a joint stock company.' There would be people who would get stuck, yes, this was my logic in terms of management. Do you see companies appointing a CEO at the age of 30 to head a huge giant company? If you ask this to someone now, they would say, 'A huge
""Can such a giant company be delivered?"" he asks. Once you are aware of the matter and understand it, it will be delivered like honey. It's a matter of accumulation, it's a matter of trust, and with it you can move forward.
Now, of course, they have wanted to continue on their path by shackles this country for a long time, saying 'let it be small, let it be ours'. But this era is now ending. Now is the time to raise the understanding of 'let it be big, let it be for all of us'. Constitutional amendment is here
With this approach, it paves the way for a strong Turkey, a great Turkey, and a prosperous Turkey.
This system is not needed by me personally, but by our country and our nation. In other words; We are moving to the presidential system, not for myself but for our country, with my support and contribution, and for the future of this brave nation. How else can you say yes to such a system?
We say 'Of course yes'.
With these feelings, I wish the Presidential System Symposium to be beneficial and successful once again. I would like to thank everyone who will contribute. I congratulate SETA Management again for organizing this important and meaningful meeting. My love to you,
I offer my respects, stay in good health.

Speech to Citizens Keeping 'Democracy Watch',2016-08-10,"

Ankara, Capital Ankara,
Ankara, which is not only the capital of our state but also the capital of hearts,
Ankara, which was subjected to an invasion attempt for the first time in its history on July 15,
Ankara, which prevents the ambitions of traitors with one heart and one wrist;
I greet you wholeheartedly.
I greet each of our 80 provinces from Ankara, our capital. I greet our 79 million citizens from the Presidential Complex, one of the places where actual resistance against the coup plotters took place.
Ankara was one of the rare cities in our country that did not have a liberation day. July 15 is the liberation day of Ankara, along with the whole of Turkey. On July 15, our nation has met the ambitions of those who wanted to condemn it to captivity, humiliation, pain, oppression and chaos.
He left it in his crops. July 15 showed the whole world that the people living in this country are not just a random group, but a nation.
What does he say in the Ankara Anthem: “Look at the stone of Ankara, look at the tears in my eyes. ""We captured the enemy, take care of fate."" On the night of July 15, this nation once again showed its nobility by taking everyone who was hostile to it, along with the coup plotters, captive.
May God bless this nation. Ankara, whose 148 children became martyrs and 1223 children became veterans, wrote a very different epic that night. Indeed, that night, in the Red Crescent, in the Parliament, in the General Staff, in Gölbaşı, in Kazan, in Mamak, in Etimesgut, in Yenimahalle, in Ankara Police Station.
In short, a separate epic was written in every corner of Ankara in front of the Directorate. May God have mercy on all our martyrs, I offer my condolences to their families and our nation. I wish God's recovery to our veterans and express my gratitude.
My dear brothers and sisters, my dear nation;
This nation wrote a different epic in Yenikapı on Sunday. In fact, it opened a new door to the 21st century, a new door to democracy, and a new door to justice. We held our Democracy and Martyrs Rally with the participation of 5 million people. unity there
There was unity there, there was brotherhood there. May God always preserve our unity, solidarity and brotherhood.
In fact, they said let's continue the democracy watches with the rally in Istanbul. We said that you are already continuing this in your heart and spiritual world. But I know that our nation clings so tightly to its country, its freedom and its future.
We did not have the heart to say it was over. We wanted to make the finale here, in Ankara. Now I see that our nation still does not want to leave the squares.
There was a principle that Gazi Mustafa Kemal, the founder of our Republic, expressed during the most troubled days of the War of Independence, what did he say? He said, ""There is no line defense, there is only surface defense, that surface is the whole country."" We also say; democracy watch is only certain
It cannot be held in certain places at certain hours, we will protect our democracy, our freedom, our state, our future 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in our homes, workplaces, everywhere. In other words, we will be on democracy watch in every corner of the country, every hour of the day.
Because you see, it is not clear where the danger, threat, trap, betrayal, sabotage will come from, when it will come, or from whom.
Today, we have martyrs again in Şırnak, there are explosions in Mardin and Diyarbakır. FETO leaves the treason watch, PKK takes over, it leaves, DAESH takes over. We know that this is the requirement of all of them. We know that this is due to their nature, they
also does this. It does what its characters require.
My brothers, they will die one or two during the watch of treason, while we are on watch for democracy and defending the homeland, God will say, ""If you squeeze the soil, the land will gush out for the doubters / May God take everything I have, life and soul, / May God not leave me alone in the world from my only homeland.""
We will continue on our way.
As you can see, on one side there is attaining the good news of God through an honorable struggle, and on the other side there is perishing as 'belhum adal' at a level lower than an animal. We follow the path of God, the path of independence, this path towards the future, the path of the nation.
We are proud to be among those who left. Those who follow the path of the charlatan in Pennsylvania who sold his soul to the devil will end up in disappointment. The fate of those who follow the project organization called DAESH, which sheds only Muslim blood, is disappointing. 30 years to divide this country and nation
Those who fall for the lies of the PKK, which has been shedding blood for years, will end up in disappointment. The situation of those who sow the seeds of discord and hostility within our nation through differences of sect and disposition is no different, they are also in disappointment.
On July 15, our nation clearly gave its message not only to FETO, but also to everyone and everyone with similar ambitions. No one can disintegrate this country, divide this nation, or destroy this state without risking reliving Manzikert, the conquest of Istanbul, and Çanakkale.
does not wash. We last showed the public what price we were willing to pay for this on July 15th. Those who thought they could take over this country on the night of July 15 actually planned everything very well, in their opinion. But they made a huge mistake in their calculations. They
They had planes, they had F16s. But we bought them, we paid for them. They had helicopters, but we took them. They had tanks, they had armored carriers, we bought them. They had guns in their hands, we took them. But what we got
It turns out that we handed it over to these traitors, these tyrants. That night, millions of people took to the streets and faced rifles, tanks, helicopters and planes. They couldn't think of anything, this nation would stand against them.
Look, another financier of these was caught in Bulgaria today, his asylum was not accepted, he was rejected and he was handed over to Turkey, we received it. We are chasing, we will chase, we are chasing him too. Sooner or later, the United States will also make a choice;
Either Türkiye or Feto. Either the coup terrorist Feto or the country of democracy, Türkiye; has to make this choice. 85 boxes of files were gone. Such a coup supporter, such a coup organizer, this oppressor, this scoundrel, this charlatan who has been sheltering in his country for nearly 17 years.
I guess America will not keep it any longer but will send it.
My dear brothers and sisters;
They had not even imagined that this state, with its President, Prime Minister, political party leaders, Police Department, judiciary and municipalities, would turn against them as a whole. They thought it was something else. within the Turkish Armed Forces
They had not thought that there could be honest officers and patriots. They could not foresee that the soldiers, who are the true sons of this country, would not be included in the scenario they wrote. These are the reasons why a son of the country like Ömer Halisdemir came out and took pride in themselves.
They didn't think he would hit it in the middle. You can become a brigadier general as much as you want, depending on what's in this army. He was also one of the adjutants before. And that Ömer Halisdemir received the news that he had come for the coup and he did his duty. Allah's rank
I hope he will be one of the martyrs who are neighbors of the Prophet. I hope God will grant patience to all his relatives.
And I go further, they didn't think that my Special Operations police brothers, whom they rained bombs on, would unite with their other colleagues and put a barrier in front of them. But 53 of our brothers were martyred in the Special Operations. With what? With the bombs they dropped, from the planes
with the bombs they dropped. What conscience, what vileness! Who is that Special Operations Officer? Son of this country. Our police, our Special Operations Officer; They even destroyed them completely. But what price their brothers, their fighting friends will make them pay?
They didn't think, they couldn't think.
Because they had eyes but could not see, they had ears but could not hear, they had a mouth and a tongue but could not speak. Because the heart was sealed. And they too were sealed. They could not calculate these. Because all the calculators were locked at that moment. There are no more tanks in our country.
They thought that there were no heroes left who would get in, get out, and bravely face the barrels.
But you see, a young Sabri appears, throws himself between the pallets of the tank, escapes from the first pallet, throws himself under the second tank, and again gets injured while going through the pallets. When I called him, his answer was significant: 'President,
'How are you?' he says. When I say, 'You leave me alone, tell me how you are,' he says, 'My doctor uncles are looking after me, my nurse sisters are looking after me.' Age 34. I said, 'So, what are you doing?' The answer I received is very meaningful; 'I am an imam hatip and theology graduate, but
""I have been working on air defense systems since I was 6 years old, and now I am working on computer software on air defense systems in the private sector,"" he said. This is what they couldn't calculate.
And what is more interesting, I have to tell this memory in one of the martyrs' houses I visited; I have a brother named Çetin there too. Turns out he lives next door to me in Istanbul. I heard from his father, he says to his wife that evening; 'Lady, I'm going.' Where?
To the bridge. He performed his ablution and performed the martyrdom prayer and said to his wife, ""I'm leaving, pray."" His wife said, ""I will come too,"" and they went to the bridge together. Our brother Çetin is martyred on the bridge. From Sivas Koyulhisar. This is what they couldn't calculate. The martyrs' hill is not empty,
They couldn't calculate this.
Thank God, martyrs do not die, the homeland is indivisible. Our Lord gives the good news; “Do not call them dead, they are alive, but you do not know.” They thought that Ulubatlı Hasans, Koca Seyits, Nene Hatuns, Kara Fatmas and Black Snakes were extinct.
Here is my sister, who lives in Vatan Street, Esenler, they destroyed her with an armored carrier, martyred her like that, and she walked towards God like that. But neither when I talked to his master nor to his son, their stance and behavior were above all praise.
Because they understood martyrdom.
But these FETO members did not think that such a person would appear with men and women, young and old. Our companion, our Erol, also went there with his son. Unfortunately, he was martyred there with the bullets he received in his head and shoulder.
His 17-year-old son was also martyred there. And if our Erol had been alive, he would have organized the rally we held last Sunday. But we did it with colleagues, because we did it that way for years.
Members of the Fethullahist terrorist organization also rushed to their fate with the dream of taking over the country and the nation on July 15. As we called them a terrorist organization, they asked us, ""Is it an unarmed terrorist organization?"" They said this when I voiced this for years. These
Can there be an unarmed terrorist organization? They were armed with state weapons, and they made their calculations accordingly. On July 15, they turned the weapons that the state entrusted to their honor to protect the country into the nation and declared that they were the most despicable terrorist organization in the world.
They showed. Yes, this treacherous organization, with whose injustice, lawlessness, slander and hypocrisy we have been fighting for years, has blood on its hands, as well as the blood of the nation.
This nation forgives every mistake, tolerates every shortcoming, but is intolerant in the face of betrayal. The Fethullahist terrorist organization betrayed both the country and the nation. The terror displayed by these traitors under the guise of a coup attempt is nothing more than a rehearsal for the invasion of Turkey.
It is nothing. We know that those who take arms against their own nation will also offer their own country to others. Thank God, the gun they pulled on the nation exploded in their own faces, hitting them like a boomerang. And again, thank God, there is not much in the history of the country they want to give away.
They are walking towards their goals with a rare unity. What does the Master say: “We opened a breach in the wall, is it holy? / O you treacherous wind, now blow from whichever direction you wish.” Does not matter.
My brothers;
We always said this when we set out, remember: We have a Rabia too, right, we have a Rabia too. What was the first of our Rabia? One nation. We, here is the picture, we are one nation. With its Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Bosnians,
In short, 79 million people are one nation.
Two; Alhamdulillah, one flag... ""What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if anyone dies for it."" Where does the color of our flag come from? From the blood of our martyrs and veterans. The crescent is the expression of our independence... The star is our martyr himself...
And three; one homeland... We have a homeland of 780 thousand square kilometers, right? No one should be taken into account on this land of our country, those who are taken into account will pay the price for it. Now someone from Qandil is making his own statements. They would go down to the cities,
They were going to go to the city from the countryside. If you have a future, you also have something to see, know that. In other words, PKK on one side, FETO on the other, DAESH on the other, PYD on the other, YPG on the other, come on in! With God's permission, you will not be able to surpass this nation, with God's permission.
You will not surpass this nation. My brothers, I believe this: We die once and we come to life a thousand times, and terrorist organizations should also know this.
Fourth, there is only one state... There is no other state than our Republic of Turkey. What is that parallel state, let's see if you could establish it. Have you been spoiled? You ate, but you're not done. We will eradicate them. We have now entered their lair, we will exterminate them. It's also clear
I say: We do not do these out of revenge; We clean these invaders with law and justice, we clean them within the law. No one should give us advice from anywhere. We implement whatever is in our Constitution, our law, and we will continue to do so.
We will.
My brothers;
I have shared my opinions on this subject with you before, as you know, I shared it on Sunday, and I say it again; Politicians should not and cannot put aside this demand of my people. What should they do? It is to discuss this in Parliament. While this was being discussed in Parliament
No one should try to explain it with legal loopholes. The date of this coup is clear, so this should be discussed from the date of the coup. If the Parliament says yes to this request, I, as the President, will repair it. If parliament doesn't say yes, of course I
There is nothing I can do. Because we cannot torture the souls of our martyrs. We cannot betray our veterans. And if we call it democracy, then we cannot refuse the people's demand. Democracy is a regime where the demands of the nation are the power, and we do this.
And my dear brothers and sisters; Now we know our Rabia, right? Do not forget this. Let's shout it out together, are you ready? One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state... Good luck.
I express my gratitude to our veterans. I wish that the wars of all our brothers and all Ankara residents who took to the roads that night saying 'I will either be a martyr or a veteran' and who stood against the coup plotters with faith and belief will once again be blessed. Of course throughout Türkiye
We have 240 martyrs, 2195 injured and veterans. May God bless them all. I would like to thank my citizens who declared their loyalty to their country and nation with their enthusiasm and dignity during democracy watches. May God preserve our country and our nation forever.
I say bless you.
And now we are dropping the comma and taking a break from these democracy watches. But we will not remove these seizures from our spiritual world and our heart world. Do we have an agreement?
Thank you very much. May God bless you. Your efforts will not be forgotten, you have made history. You wrote with our martyrs, you wrote with our veterans. With his artists, without any discrimination, without any political thought, from night to morning,
You made history with its athletes, politicians, all media and most of them. That's why the world will admire your unity. Don't worry, we will all be upright, we will be alive, we will be big, we will be brothers and we will be Turkey.
",2023-07-15,The coup attempt was suppressed.,after
Their Speech at the 'Democracy and Martyrs Rally',2016-08-07,"

Our 11th President, Mr. Gül,
Dear Speaker of our Parliament,
Mr. İsmail Kahraman, the President of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, who achieved the honor of being a veteran for the second time,
Dear AK Party Chairman and Prime Minister,
Dear Chief of General Staff,
Dear Chairman of the Republican People's Party,
Dear Nationalist Movement Party Chairman,
Dear Prime Minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,
Dear guests, dear Istanbulites,
My dear citizens who follow us live in the squares in our 81 provinces, my dear brothers whose eyes and hearts are with us all over the world,
My dear nation, who rose up once again for its independence and future on the night of July 15, and who did not surrender their country to the Fethullahist terrorist organization and invaders at the expense of their lives;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. At the very beginning of my words, I would like to mention all those who had the courage to take to the streets, squares, fill the airports and stand against the barrels, tanks, helicopters and planes on the night of July 15.
I would like to express my gratitude once again to my brothers.

240 of these brothers, including 172 civilians, 63 police officers and 5 soldiers, reached the state of martyrdom. Once again, I wish God's mercy upon them and my condolences to their relatives. My condolences to our nation. Again that night, he heroically marched against the coup plotters.
2195 of our brothers were injured and attained the rank of veteran. I pray to God for healing for our injured people who are receiving treatment in hospitals and at home.

Among the millions of our citizens who filled the streets and squares that night, literally killing death, those who deserve the honor of martyrdom and veteran status have their names written in golden letters in history. Believe me, it takes everything to reach these ranks in the struggle for the homeland.
It is not a privilege that can be seized at any time or acquired at any time.

What does our Independence Poet say in our National Anthem:
""Who would not be sacrificed for the sake of the heavenly homeland that,
To gush Martyrs land tighter the şüheda.
May Huda take my soul and all that I have,
""Don't let my only homeland make me disappear in the world.""

My dear brothers and sisters;
Each of our brothers who filled the streets and squares on the night of July 15 has a contribution, a share, a role in the protection of our homeland, democracy and freedom. That's why I say; As 79 million, may all of us have a blessed day, Istanbul's
May his war be blessed, may Ankara's war be blessed. May every city that was subjected to a coup attempt be blessed. Leaving aside all their differences against the coup attempt, they came together with their women, children, elderly, people of all origins and dispositions.
May all our citizens who admire the world be blessed.

My brothers;
This nation is a different nation, indeed the Turkish nation stood against the coup plotters with the same belief and determination that opened the doors of Anatolia a thousand years ago in Manzikert, with the same feeling on July 15th. Süleyman Shah founded our first state in this geography in 1075.
We took care of our country on July 15 with the same vision and horizon as it was founded with the same vision. On the same foundations on which Osman Gazi built the most powerful state in history in 1299, we defended Turkey that night around the same principles. Our ancestors are 100 years old
With the same understanding that he fought to the last drop of his blood in Çanakkale, on July 15, we repelled the FETO terrorist organization and the coup plotters with the same will. It is a part of the belief that enabled Gazi Mustafa Kemal to start the War of Independence and bring it to victory.
A similar one was on the loose in all cities of Turkey on July 15.

July 15 showed our friends that this country is strong not only against political, economic and diplomatic attacks, but also against military sabotage, and that it will not collapse or derail. On the same night, they put their hands to destroy Turkey.
Our enemies, who were waiting and waiting, woke up the next day with the grief of seeing that their job would be much more difficult from now on.

Now, today, we have this image here with the Chief of General Staff, in Yenikapı Square with the President, the Prime Minister, the chairmen of the Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Movement Party, and people of all views and dispositions in our 81 provinces.
Believe me, this image upset and devastated the enemies of our country at least as much as the morning of July 16th. What do we always say about him? We will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together.

This view, with all its colors, these steps taken towards Turkey's independence and future, these are very important. This is a declaration and proof of protecting our homeland for the future. This view does not contain even a single stone of our thousand-year-old homeland.
It is the declaration and proof of the price that those who covet will be willing to pay. This view is a declaration and proof that Turkey will achieve its 2023 goals. Do you know what our job is from now on? To rise above the level of contemporary civilizations. Are we ready to achieve this?
This view of unity, solidarity and brotherhood is not just a wish, not just a slogan; It is the declaration and proof that it can be put forward as a truth when necessary and that it can be transformed into action.

My brothers;
With all this, we will move forward in solidarity. We will take on flesh and bones, we will be humble, we will love each other not for rank or position, not for money, but only for God. As the children of such a nation, it is our pleasure to be in your presence.
Thank God, it gives me great pride, and I thank God for that.

Look, Gazi Mustafa Kemal, the founder of our Republic, said the following in those dark days when most of the country, especially Istanbul and Izmir, were under occupation in 1920: “Our nation is very great, let's not be afraid, it will not accept slavery and humiliation.
But to gather him together and say to him; It is necessary to ask, ""O people, do you accept slavery and humiliation?"" I am waiting for the answer my nation will give, now I am asking it once again: 96 years after Gazi, I am asking you the same question from Yenikapı Square.
I ask: Hey nation, do you accept captivity and humiliation? That's the point. Yes, no one will ever be able to bring this slavery to this nation.

Currently, the chairmen of our political parties are here, they already know your request. Since 'sovereignty belongs unconditionally to the nation' and you have requested the death penalty, the authority that will decide this is the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
After our parliament makes such a decision, the step to be taken is clear. If it is to approve, I express in advance such a decision coming from the Parliament; repair.

My brothers;
When I see my brother whose body is cut in half on Vatan Street, is it possible to stand up and put it aside? The head of my sister, whose head was separated from her body by the bomb dropped by F16s from the plane in front of the Presidential Complex in Ankara, was buried in the Congress Center.
It had flown onto its roof. After seeing this, we cannot stand up and say, 'Sir, there is no death penalty in the European Union, not in the Council, not here, not here.' It exists in America, it exists in the vast majority of countries, it exists in Japan, it exists in China, today it exists in the vast majority of the world.
there is. It was already here until 84, after which it was removed. If this nation makes such a decision, since 'sovereignty belongs unconditionally to the nation', I believe that political parties will also comply with this decision.

You actually showed that you will not accept slavery and humiliation on July 15 by putting your chest to the gun barrels, lying in front of the tanks, and even attacking planes and helicopters. You know, what does it say in our National Anthem, ""Shield your body and let this shameless thing stop?""
influx."" You shielded your chest. You came to the point of the barrels and put your body personally. You slept under tanks. I see that one of our veterans throws himself between the two pallets of the tanks, escapes the first tank, and throws himself under the second tank in the same way.
He throws it, only his arm is seriously injured. Do you know what he said when I called him on the phone? 'Leave me alone, President, how are you?' She says. This is a completely different soul, a completely different love. “Faith is that gem, how great is the divine, the one without faith
""The rusty heart is a burden on the chest."" The unbelievers could not stand against the believers.

This FETO planned many insidious things, but failed to calculate one thing. What was that? He also could not take this nation into account. He never took into account the faith of this nation, the faith of this nation, the wisdom of this nation. He thought that some of their minds were already talking, 'These
""He doesn't come in front of the gun or anything,"" he says. What happened? You know, some of the men you trained, those traitors in our Armed Forces? Here, of course, we should exclude the majority of our Turkish Armed Forces and our patriotic and nationalist soldiers.
I do. You have just demonstrated this while our Chief of General Staff was speaking. Likewise, within our Police Department... If those who were truly patriotic and nationalist had not put themselves forward, our job would have been much more difficult.

However, I have a speech from here this evening; The government made a statement regarding the closure of military high schools. Some veterans said this was wrong. Now I call out to them from here and say; That's the only type that was bred from there
FETO members did this. Now we say; Our military schools will stop, all our high schools, all those who graduated from this country's high schools, can come and enter here easily. Why only one type? Let them all enter. And in military academies, military schools
Whatever training is given should be given there. From now on, anyone who makes a similar attempt will receive the same response from their nation.

What does our artist say in his beautiful song:
“Travel my son
Knock over enemies that want occupy your land.!
Who is your friend, who is your enemy, my son?
Write your history with honor, my son.
Write, my son!
The road to eternity goes from you, my son.
You should spread it all around, my son.
Break your bread with the hungry, my son.
Do not eat haram, die for the sake of truth, my son!”
Are we ready to die? Are we ready to move forward? Are we ready to rise above the level of contemporary civilizations? First God.

My dear nation;
As a state and nation, we must analyze the July 15 coup attempt very well. We must carefully evaluate not only those who committed this betrayal, but also the forces behind them and the motives that motivated them. Members of the Fethullah terrorist organization,
There are still people who hesitate to mention their names. Let's not hesitate, those who are in power should state their names exactly so that those who do not know them can learn who these FETO members are, who is this FETO, who is the Fethullahist terrorist organization.

They are the apparent tools of the threat to our country. We know that this game, this scenario is beyond their capabilities. Of course, we have to reveal this organization with all its members and destroy it within the legal framework. But if we are content with just this, the state and
As a nation, we would defend our body against similar viruses, leaving our defenses weak. Treason networks that can infiltrate everywhere, from our Armed Forces to our judiciary, from our Police Department to our intelligence agencies, from our schools to our hospitals.
We must strengthen ourselves against it. It does not matter whether the name of this treason network is PKK, FETO, DAESH or any other organization. The names of organizations may change, their staff may change, their discourse may change; but they all belong to the Turkish nation, the Turkish State.
The fact that he has enemies never changes.

At this point, the sides are very clear; On one side is the Republic of Turkey with all its institutions, all its political parties, all its segments, and on the other side are terrorist organizations, some of which are involved in ethnic abuse, some in religious abuse, and some in ideological perversion.
There are dark forces behind them. Everyone who is in favor of their state, nation, right and truth is here in Yenikapı today. Greetings to 80 provinces from here, greetings to 79 million from here. Some of the members of terrorist organizations are in the courthouse.
Some are waiting for their fate, some are serving their sentences in prison, and some are giving their final account in the grave. We know very well the forces behind them, and when the time comes, we will bring them to account.

We must make the most of this spirit of unity and solidarity that we have achieved and turn July 15 into a milestone for the construction of a stronger, larger and more prosperous Turkey. Our recent history has events that make consciences bleed and create question marks in minds.
We must reveal the shortcomings and mistakes by discussing all the problematic and troubling events. We must re-examine the cases that paved the way for the FETO treason gang's effectiveness in the Turkish Armed Forces. We must examine many similar cases. questionable
We have to review all the exams, all the procedures. We must put the politics, media and business world, which this organization wants to design with the power it has illegitimately acquired, back into their natural course. We show our nation's religious sensitivity, compassion and kindness at home.
We must put at the disposal of our nation all the opportunities they have obtained by exploiting their sense of solidarity.

No one should be worried about the closed dormitories, schools and houses; both the relevant institutions of our state and our non-governmental organizations serving in the same field will fill this gap with much better and much more. Abroad
We must use the name and reputation of our country and return the opportunities they have gained to their real owner, that is, our state and nation. Our government has taken, and continues to take, very important steps in all these areas with the authority it has after the declaration of the state of emergency.
It does. Our Gazi Council is doing its part in this regard and will continue to do so. I believe that our political parties and media will evaluate this process very well and give their support and these laws, Constitutional amendments, amendments to the law or new laws,
These will be prepared quickly.
My brothers;
With every step taken since the night of July 15, 79 million people united with one heart, you became one voice, you conducted the democracy watch differently, here you are, today in Yenikapı Square, crowning the democracy watch. We all have our flag with crescent and star, our red flag
We met under the unity of unity. Hopefully, together we will carry out the process of restructuring the state and building a policy in this direction within a stronger, more prosperous country.

My brothers;
I would especially like to reiterate here a point that we have been expressing on every occasion for the last 3 weeks: Yes, July 15 is, in one sense, a coup attempt launched by members of the FETO treason network that infiltrated our army. But the incident is not just about this, it is also
It is an attempt to take the result intended to be achieved through the armed actions of PKK and DAESH to a new level by terrorists dressed in military uniforms. So this attempt is also an act of terrorism. In addition to all these features, the country of July 15
and is attempting to invade our country by an armed force that betrays its nation.

If the coup had been successful, we all know very well to whom this geography, which has been ours for a thousand years, would have been presented to them on a silver platter. On the night of July 15, we shared all these facts with AK Party members, CHP members, MHP members, and our citizens belonging to other parties.
We saw it together. On the night of July 15, we fought shoulder to shoulder in the streets because we saw this reality together with 79 million Turks, Kurds, Laz, Bosnians, Circassians, Arabs, Roma. That night, people were celebrating their lifestyle, not their party.
He became a martyr and a veteran in front of the bullets, thinking not of his own disposition, not of his own interests, but of our total independence and future as a country and nation. Instead of the call to prayer that is intended to be silenced from our minarets, on the contrary, we hear from the minarets
The calls to prayer grew louder, the salas became louder. No interest is before or sweeter than one's own life. Those who stood against the coup plotters that night knew that if their country lost its independence and the future of their nation became dark, there would be nothing left behind anyway.
He knew very well. In this magnificent meeting, I wish God's mercy to all our martyrs. I once again wish God's recovery to all our veterans.

The 'national will', which we have been talking about for years, gained strength with these martyrs and veterans. For this reason, we argue that it is necessary to surrender and submit to the decisions made by each individual of our nation with their own free will. our nation
With his immense wisdom, he has always found and will always find the most correct, the most beneficial and the most beneficial. Those who look at this nation, our 79 million citizens, and say that they see 'an uneducated, wimpy, useless mass of people', as I say from time to time, will lose their lives on July 15th.
They experienced the biggest shock and the biggest embarrassment. Now it is time for everyone to accept this fact: The foundation of this nation is strong.

Look, a 6th grade student who sent me a letter from Yozgat says, “I was very afraid of the attack on our country on July 15. I thought back to myself, I said, this country was not won easily so it could be lost so easily. I wish I was big
I wish I could do something too. ""I sent my allowance to the Parliament to contribute to its repair.""

This nation, this... The citizens of the Republic of Turkey are not a mere crowd, they are a nation, a great nation that amazes the world with its courage and wisdom. Let us not forget that this nation, together with those living within the borders of our country, has a wide
It is a nation that supports the prayers of hundreds of millions of oppressed and innocent people in a geography.

I always say that our physical boundaries are different, our heart boundaries are different. What does the poet say:
“While blooming in the land of your hands,
Snow is coming with us, my friend.
Who drew this border in my heart?
""It's getting tight, it's getting tight, brother.""
Yes, the borders of our hearts are wide enough to cover every society and every geography that sees us as their brother and friend. Hopefully, the coming period will be a period in which both our own people and all the oppressed people of the world who put their hope in us will smile.
Once again, I express my gratitude to my noble nation, my dear nation.

I would like to thank my citizens who participated in the Democracy and Martyrs Rally in Yenikapı and from every corner of our country for their strong stance by saying 'victory belongs to democracy, the square belongs to the nation'.

On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank the chairman of our parties, the Chairman of the AK Party, the Chairman of the Republican People's Party, the Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, for their interest and interest in my invitation.

I send greetings, love and respect from Istanbul to all my people, my entire country, my nation, who are currently watching us in 80 provinces except Istanbul. They heroically resisted those involved in the coup attempt from the first moment and fought against the coup plotters with all the means at their disposal.
I would like to thank our struggling Police Department and our devoted police officers.

Likewise, of course, we cannot forget Ömer Halis. When the Special Forces were attacked, he acted like a petty officer, immediately followed the instructions given by his commander, killed him by shooting him in the forehead, and walked away to become a martyr. Our Armed Forces
Yes, I would also like to thank all our units, our Chief of General Staff, and our force commanders who put themselves forward with their heart and courage.

From now on, we will examine very well who is under us and who is where, in each unit. We will examine who is in the judiciary and put them at the door. If it is prison, we will put them in prison and they will pay the price for what they did.

My dear brothers and sisters;
I would also like to thank all our municipalities who supported our citizens and forces who resisted the coup attempt with their vehicles, personnel and all their strength, and who served them even their meals during the democracy watch.

On the night of July 15, along with our country, there were our brothers in Germany, France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, America, in short, wherever there was a Turk, their hearts beat for us. I would also like to express my gratitude to our citizens abroad. These are our citizens
I know that they are having a hard time due to the criticism, harassment and negative publications of the Western media. Here is Germany; I was going to connect to the rally there via video conference, but they did not let me connect, they decided against it. What about democracy? But to those in Qandil via video conference
They had it published. No matter what happens, tomorrow will not be what they expected, it will hit them like a boomerang. Let them feed those terrorists, they will hit them tomorrow.

I hope God will protect our country and our nation against any further coups, coup attempts, and all kinds of undemocratic attacks. But as I said, we will be one, we will be big, we will love each other for the sake of Allah.
“Let the brave men all say amen,
""Allahu Akbar, martyrs from the sky, amen, amen.""
I hope our night will be bright, our future will be bright, and all darkness will be gone.
Stay healthy, he says, and I entrust you to God.

By the way, of course, there are ships coming from the sea, I would like to especially thank our captains, the owners of these ships, and the fishing boats on behalf of myself and my nation. And today you stood here for 7 hours, 8 hours, and again, I would like to thank all our healthcare professionals.
Thank you very much. Thank you, live long, may God be our helper, may God bless you.

Dear Istanbul, of course we are putting a comma on the democracy watch this evening. I call out to all of Turkey; Hopefully we will put an end to it on Wednesday evening. Is it appropriate? Just a comma this evening, a period on Wednesday evening; Ok? May you be alive and well.

Their Speech to the Squares Regarding the July 15 Coup Attempt,2016-07-23,"

My dear brothers and sisters who are watching us live in the squares in 81 provinces and districts of Turkey,
My dear nation, who stands against tanks, cannons, planes, helicopters and rifles with only their faith, belief and heart,
My lion-hearted brothers and sisters who defeated the July 15 armed coup attempt, My precious brothers and citizens who have demonstrated their determination to protect their independence and future by not leaving the streets and squares empty for days;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection.
I respectfully salute the dignified gentlemen, ladies, young people and children who did not surrender the squares to the coup plotters, saying that today is the day to stand up for our will. On July 15, Fethullahist terrorism filled the squares, airports, roads and bridges.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens, from 7 to 70, who defeated the traitors of the organization.
Likewise, I would like to thank all my brothers and sisters in Asia, Africa, Europe and all over the world who stand by our nation with their prayers and banners in their hands. I would like to thank all the leaders of friendly countries who expressed their support to us.
I wish God's mercy to our heroic martyrs. We had 246 martyrs in the July 15 coup attempt, including 62 police officers, 179 civilians and 5 soldiers. May God surround them with His compassion and mercy and make them neighbors of our Prophet. The number of our injured is 2186,
I pray to God for a speedy recovery to our wounded.
Our martyrs and veterans made history on the night of July 15 with their courage, fortitude, determination and upright stance. Undoubtedly, our martyrs will always maintain their special place in our hearts. In addition, we commemorate our July 15 Martyrs every year.
We will remember them especially on Memorial Day and pass their memories on to future generations.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Today, the real composer of the freedom songs sung with enthusiasm and pride in the squares of our 81 provinces and districts and throughout Turkey is our nation itself. On the night of July 15, there were no Sunni-Alevi, no Turk-Kurd, no Circassian-Roma on the streets,
There was no right or left wing, rich or poor, government or opposition in the squares at night. On July 15, just like in Çanakkale, in our War of Independence, there was a great Turkey, a Turkish nation, with all its members united as one heart, one wrist, and did not let a handful of coup plotters violate its will.
In this coup attempt, our nation demonstrated its determination to claim this geography as a homeland, just like in Manzikert a thousand years ago. Our nation invaded Anatolian lands, just like 717 years ago in Söğüt and 563 years ago in Istanbul.
He shouted to the whole world that he sees it as a future beyond being a living space. Our nation gave the same answer on July 15 as it did 100 years ago in Çanakkale, Kut'ül Ammare and Dumlupınar to those who attacked this country not to benefit them.
gave.
July 15, our nation; No matter where its roots are, no matter what power it relies on, no matter which focus it surrenders its will to, it is a historical challenge against this nation and those who do not belong to this country. Thank God, it is not just this or that group that poses this challenge.
Our entire nation did it.
I would like to express my gratitude to all our political parties that support the struggle for democracy, and to all my citizens who volunteer and vote for these parties, for standing by the rule of law, rights and freedoms, and the future of our nation and country.
I appreciate and gratefully acknowledge the efforts of our citizens living abroad to stand by their country and nation to the extent of their means, from the moment they received the news of the coup. On the night of July 15, Türkiye saw all its differences, all
Leaving all their colors and dispositions behind, they united around the principles of one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state.
Those who took action on the evening of July 15, thinking that they could discipline Turkey and take over the state through the members of this treason gang, through these traitors, were disappointed by our nation before the evening of the next day. This
My statement also applies to those who put them on the streets as a pack of murderers along with the pokers, we know all of them. When the time comes, we will present their accounts to them.
Now is the time to work, we will work, we will work hard. We will reach Turkey's 2023 targets. Not only that, we will realize our 2053 and 2071 visions. Foreign dependence in the defense industry, which has become one of the largest economies in the world, has been completely eliminated.
No one can stand in the way of a Turkey that implements its large projects and investments without interruption.
Because they know this, they try to stop us and trip us up at every opportunity they get. Where their own power is not enough, they activate the betrayal networks around us and within us. The PKK trouble in Turkey has never been resolved.
That's why it doesn't end. This is the reason why a branch of this organization called PYD was invented in Syria and appeared along our southern borders. The invention of an organization called DAESH and its infestation in our region and country is aimed at the same purpose.
The aim of those who have been using this organization called FETO against us for the last three years, first with its members in the judiciary and police, and when they failed, with its uniformed terrorists in the army, is the same. Horny pawns of those who want to prevent the holy march of our country
The terrorists were defeated once again by the common will and unwavering courage of the nation.
This coup attempt was made against our nation, our government, our Parliament, as well as the Turkish Armed Forces. Our Turkish Armed Forces and our Turkish soldiers are the apple of our eye. On July 15, we also dressed our Turkish Armed Forces in this military uniform.
We saved him from the attack of terrorists wearing uniforms. With the failure of this armed coup attempt, Türkiye has entered a new era. As the poet said: “Don't worry my hero, time is on our side. / The smoke rising from our ashes is on our side. / Last station,
The last divine decree is on our side. / Even though the world is our enemy, faith is on our side.” Praise be to our Lord, who gave us victory against the traitors who made us experience these beautiful days.
My dear nation;
We did not approve of this, just as we have never approved any initiative against Turkey or its 79 million people. They should follow the events moment by moment from the first moments of the incident, give the necessary instructions to the relevant authorities, and protect our nation on the streets.
We revealed our stance by calling. Thank God, our citizens heeded our calls and filled the streets and squares, not leaving the squares to the coup plotters. May God bless you.
Now, all those involved in this incident are accountable to their state, our security forces and justice. The number of people detained so far is 13,165. Of these, 8,838 are soldiers, 2,101 are judges-prosecutors, 1,485 are police, 52 are civil administrators, and 689 are civilians. By being arrested
The number of those imprisoned is 5863, including 123 generals, 282 high-ranking police officers, and 1559 judges-prosecutors. The interrogations of the others continue.
In order to ensure that the measures after the coup attempt can be carried out effectively and quickly, our government declared a state of emergency with the advice of our National Security Council. This decision was also approved by our Parliament. State of Emergency Authorities Today
Within this framework, the first decree laws were issued and the process was started.
With the decrees published in today's Official Gazette, the detention period was increased from 4 days to 1 month. Civil servants belonging to the Fethullah Terrorist Organization began to be dismissed from civil service. There are 934 schools, 109 dormitories, 15 universities, 104 foundations,
35 health institutions, 1125 associations and 19 unions were closed. The assets of all these institutions were seized by the state.
All our citizens who were martyred in the July 15 coup attempt were included in the martyrdom status within the scope of the fight against terrorism. Those who are dismissed from the public sector due to their relationship with this terrorist organization will never be able to become civil servants again. Suspension of execution regarding these transactions
decision will not be made. We continue to take the necessary measures, step by step, to eliminate the Fethullahist terrorist organization from our country with all its elements.
This state has the power and tradition to give the punishment they deserve to those who pull guns on it, those who shoot bullets at its citizens, those who march on its citizens with tanks, those who rain bombs on its citizens with F16s, and those who shoot with helicopters. Have no doubt; of our martyrs
His blood will never remain on the ground. The requirements of our nation's glorious democracy resistance in the squares will be fulfilled to the letter.
Turkey is a strong enough country that will not deviate from its path, deviate from its goals, or lose altitude even in the face of such a coup attempt. You see, despite the sabotage of some forces working hand in hand with the coup plotters, our economy is on its own.
It continues to operate in a stable manner. The organization or organizations that lowered our country's credit rating do not have such authority. They have no reason to convince anyone, not just us, for the grade reduction. All indicators of our economy are
It is in a much better situation than many other countries. Everything works within the rules of the free market economy and will continue to do so. There is no compromise on financial discipline, our nation has confidence in its country and economy.
Our investments will continue with the same determination. Now, August 26 is coming, hopefully we will open the third necklace Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge over the Bosphorus. Hopefully, Marmaray's brother is coming to the Bosphorus again on December 20th. Marmaray rail system,
This is the Eurasia Tunnel, where cars will pass under the sea, this is also coming. Look back to back; Osman Gazi, Yavuz Sultan Selim, Eurasia Tunnel. But now we are taking new steps. One of these is Canal Istanbul, and now Çanakkale is connected to the bridge.
We will be able to pass and Çanakkale Bridge…
We will never compromise on the economic policy based on Turkey's growth, development and development. We are progressing very strongly in the financial sector. This evening, we just met with our esteemed Prime Minister, relevant ministers, and representatives of our relevant financial institutions.
We held a very large meeting and decided on the steps to be taken.
May our nation be relieved; While Turkey continues on its way by defeating the traps set in front of it one by one through terrorist organizations, it emerges from each attack it overcomes not by getting weaker, but on the contrary, by getting stronger. Today's Türkiye left Turkey on the evening of July 15
is stronger. Because the disease was diagnosed, a scalpel was applied to the wound, and the operation is continuing successfully. With the help of my Lord, tomorrow's Türkiye will be much stronger than today.
With these thoughts, I would like to thank all 79 million people who are currently listening to us in front of their televisions in their homes and in the squares and districts of our 81 provinces, from Izmir to Erzurum, from Van to Denizli, from Trabzon to Mersin; for their courage, heroism and determination
I would like to thank you from Ankara on behalf of myself and my nation.
We will never give credit to provocateurs who want to pit our nation against each other and try to tarnish our victory. You made history by using your bodies as a shield against tanks, planes and bullets. Those who want to sabotage this holy struggle should also use foresight and
I believe you will overcome it with your foresight. Be united, be big, be alive, be brothers, be Turkey all together.
As I conclude my words, I once again remember our July 15 martyrs with mercy and gratitude. I wish recovery to our veterans. May God help us. May God open our path and our fortune. I wish you good health, have a good night.

Press Statement Made After the Council of Ministers Meeting,2016-07-20,"

My dear citizens who watch us on their screens,
Dear friends all over the world whose hearts and eyes are fixed on Turkey, my dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings.
Turkey has experienced one of the most critical days in its history since the evening hours of July 15. A group nestled within our Turkish Armed Forces, the apple of our country and nation's eye, went beyond the chain of command and launched a coup attempt.
This group, which is understood to be members of the Fethullahist terrorist organization, launched an attack against the state and the nation with planes, helicopters, tanks and weapons.
The Presidential Complex, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the Prime Ministry, the General Staff, the Gendarmerie General Command, the MİT campus, the Bosphorus Bridge and various military units were under intense attack. The determined stance of myself and the government,
Thanks to our nation's courageous stand against those who attempted a coup and the effective intervention of our security forces, this attempt did not achieve its goal.
Neither the coup plotters' weapons, tanks, helicopters or planes were of any use in the face of our nation's determined defense of its country and will. With their upright stance against terrorists dressed in military uniforms, they protect their country and its future.
Our nation, which protects us, has written heroic epics throughout the night.
All members of our nation, from young to old, from workers to bosses, from villagers to city dwellers, have united as one against the coup plotters. Our citizens stood against the traitors who attempted a coup and dozens of people were shot and martyred in front of their eyes.
While this happened, many of our injured brothers tried to save all our martyred brothers in their injured state and continued their determined resistance until the morning. Thank God, he feels like a child of this country, a member of this nation.
Everyone who felt that they were against the coup attempt.
Our nation has experienced the sadness of not being able to protect Menderes and his friends during the 1960 coup for years. The pain of our society, which could not protect its young people who were sent to the gallows in the 1980 coup with the understanding of one right and one left, is still fresh. July 15, 2016
History has been a turning point to stop this bad trend. For the first time in our country's history, an armed coup attempt was foiled by the nation itself.
Turkey has proven its commitment to democracy and the rule of law at the expense of the lives of its citizens. As a result of the fire opened by those who attempted the coup, 246 innocent people lost their lives as a result of our civilian citizens, police and soldiers.
lost, and 1536 innocent citizens were injured. On this occasion, I wish God's mercy to all our martyrs, my condolences to their families and our nation, and I wish a speedy recovery from God to our wounded.
I'm saying it very clearly, right now this political party, that political party; I'm not going to dwell on that. But as the president of the republic, I am proud of my nation and I believe, together with our nation, that by overcoming all these obstacles, we will make a heroic contribution to the history of democracy.
We, as the Turkish nation, have written its epic; It will be referred to as such.
My dear citizens;
From the moment we received news of the coup attempt, as the President, we worked very closely with our prime minister, ministers, our Police Department, and the commanders of our Armed Forces who stood against the coup plotters. Despite all the dangers and threats
We immediately went to Istanbul and, together with my nation, stood firm against the coup plotters. In the face of our nation's wisdom and determination, the coup attempt was completely eliminated before evening the next day.
Today, on Wednesday, July 20, we first convened our National Security Council and then held our Council of Ministers meeting. As a result of the comprehensive evaluation we made as members of the National Security Council, we concluded that the terrorist organization that attempted the coup
We decided to recommend to the government that a state of emergency be declared in our country in accordance with Article 120 of our Constitution, so that it can be eliminated quickly and with all its elements. In line with this recommendation, our Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency in Turkey for 3 months.
decided to do so.
As it is known, Article 120 of our Constitution allows a state of emergency to be declared in case of violent movements aimed at eliminating democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms in the country. The purpose of declaring a state of emergency is to protect democracy and law in our country.
Our aim is to take the necessary steps in the most effective and rapid way to eliminate this threat to the state and the rights and freedoms of our citizens. This practice is certainly not against democracy, law and freedom, on the contrary, it is a way of protecting these values.
and for the purpose of empowerment.
The coup attempt we experienced clearly revealed who in Turkey stands by democracy and the rule of law at the expense of their lives, and who seeks dictatorship. Our government, political parties, non-governmental organizations, Turkish Armed Forces
The command level of our forces and, most importantly, our nation have always shown that their preference is for democracy.
On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens who have filled the squares and streets since the night of July 15 and shouted that they are with their state and government.
Regardless of their party, political opinion or belief, in my eyes, every citizen who stands in front of the tanks is, as Mehmet Akif expressed: ""Faith is that gem that the Divine is great, / The rusty heart without faith is a burden on the chest."" They are truly with their faith
They stood in front of those tanks and shouted that they were running for martyrdom.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Of course, we also visited our friends who stood tall in front of the barrels, with whom we have worked together for years. You see, a 32-year-old lady of ours who lies under the pallets without looking back or forth, is walking towards martyrdom. Here they are
So low, so dishonorable, so brutal that he could crush a lady with a tank... But that sister of mine sipped the sherbet of martyrdom and walked there. They didn't stop, but neither did my nation. My citizens who did not leave their place for hours even though dozens of people were shot
Each of them has proven that they are the grandchildren of our War of Independence heroes. Despite warplanes and helicopters hovering overhead, dropping bombs and firing heavy weapons, they did not evacuate the streets and the areas targeted by terrorists disguised as soldiers.
Believe me, I cannot find words to express the heroism of my brothers.
After the coup attempt was suppressed, each of our citizens who have been on democracy watch in the squares of all our cities for days to prevent anyone else from showing the same courage again should know that they have their names written in golden letters in history.
Here it is 4 o'clock today, I saw that everyone started to walk to Kızılay since 4 o'clock, now thousands of people are in Kızılay Square, tens of thousands are in the square in Konya, and a little later we will connect to them via teleconference and address them.
This is very important: Even though they were under heavy attacks by those who attempted a coup, especially those working in the Gölbaşı Special Operations Department and Ankara Police Department buildings, they did their duties without hesitation.
The sacrifices of our police officers who rush and fight are beyond all praise.
Our nation will never forget the solid stance of our soldiers who took a determined stance against coup attempts within the Turkish Armed Forces and were martyred and injured for this cause, and will always remember them with goodness. And give them wrong orders
I hereby fondly remember the one who gave the command and said 'we are in command now', yes, our soldier who was later martyred by killing him in the head, my brother from Niğde, may he rest in peace.
I also congratulate the administrators of our institutions, especially our governorships and municipalities, who stood by their state and nation with all their means and strength from the moment they heard about the coup attempt. Likewise, the coup attempt
I would also like to express my gratitude to all our media organizations and non-governmental organizations that sided with the will of the nation against this.
My dear nation;
Turkey demonstrated the strongest state-nation unity in its history against the July 15 coup attempt, our nation defended its state and our state defended its nation. None of our citizens have any rights regarding democracy, the rule of law, fundamental rights and freedoms.
No institution should have the slightest concern. The state of emergency declared by our government aims to protect these values ​​from attacks against them, this is the main goal.
Those who do not speak out against European countries that take similar measures against terrorist incidents that are too small to be compared to the threat our country is experiencing have absolutely no right to criticize Turkey. They have absolutely every right to criticize this decision we made.
There is no, let them look at themselves first. We do not want any favors from anyone, just not to be overshadowed. This nation is capable of determining its own destiny, everyone should know this.
The declaration of a state of emergency is only to ensure that necessary measures are taken against the terrorist threat that our country faces; I would especially like to underline that it is a measure to protect democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights and freedoms.
Especially the domestic and domestic elements of the economy should not have the slightest negative reservations or hesitations about the implementation of the state of emergency. S&P (Standard & Poor's / International credit and rating agency) rated Turkey's credit rating
It reduced its outlook from BB+ to BB and its outlook from stable to negative. What do you have to do with Turkey? Türkiye is not your member at the moment anyway. You've done these before. We said, 'We have nothing to do with you' and cut off the relationship. He is currently announcing a political decision
In his own way, 'if I announce this, I wonder if investments in Turkey' will stop? S&P, don't bother, don't even bother with us, you did the same things before and it didn't work and it won't work today either. You will see how we will continue our investments with determination.
Look, we opened the Osmangazi Bridge, now we will open the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge on August 26, and hopefully we will open the Eurasia Tunnel under the Bosphorus on December 20. Your power is not enough to neither open nor make these investments of ours.
we will continue.
All these evaluations do not reflect the realities of the Turkish economy. They can do anything in times like these. In fact, they wait for these moments in such periods. If you look tomorrow, they will release a lot of viruses into the market, they will take some different steps.
They also tend to throw.
But I say this very clearly: In this process, Turkey will continue its economic reforms uninterruptedly, especially the incentives to increase savings. Our Central Bank made very good statements and preliminary statements. From this
I believe that he will continue to walk determinedly. There is and will not be any liquidity shortage in the market. Sensitivity regarding the functioning of markets within their own rules will continue within the framework of the rational economic policy followed.
As I always say, we will never compromise on financial discipline and continue on our way.
I hope that the Council of Ministers Meeting we held right after our National Security Council Meeting today and the decisions we made will be beneficial.
I say this to my nation: 'Oh no, a state of emergency has now been declared, or will the governors step aside and the Armed Forces take over the government?' Such a thing is never out of the question. On the contrary, the powers and will of our governors are limited in this process.
It will increase further and our Armed Forces will continue this process under the command and management of our governors. And we have never compromised on democracy, and we will not do so from now on, so please know that. Our Armed Forces are certainly the government's
He is at the point of acting under his command and with his government.
In accordance with the imperative provision of our Constitution, as the president elected by this nation and as the commander-in-chief, we, together with our soldiers, will continue the struggle to eliminate all those viruses in our Armed Forces. In our other institutions, security and
You also see such viruses in others, the cleaning process continues, and this will continue decisively. Because the body has metastasized like a cancer virus, we have to clean it. I hope we will clean this up so that our nation can find peace.
May our nation continue to look to the future with hope.
I remind my nation of this: Do not worry, there is no room for concern. Thank God, Turkey has overcome this crisis and will continue this process stronger with its investments from now on.
I express my gratitude to all of you with the most heartfelt feelings and I entrust you all to God. Stay healthy.

Address to the Nation,2016-07-19,"

My dear nation,
All citizens of the Republic of Türkiye,
All our friends and brothers in the world whose hearts and eyes are with our country,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, affection and gratitude.
Turkey faced a coup attempt on July 15, 2016, which started around 22:00 and continued until noon the next day.
In fact, for about 3 years, our country has been facing different forms of attempts to take over the state and the government, despite the nation and the national will.
On July 15, these attempts turned into an armed coup attempt, revealing without any doubt that Turkey was facing a terrorist attack of a different nature.
This coup attempt, initiated by a group of soldiers from various classes and ranks, members of the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, outside the chain of command of the Turkish Armed Forces, took place in a limited but dangerous dimension due to the power of the weapons in their hands.
The first signs of this coup attempt were the closure of the Bosphorus Bridge with tanks, warplanes starting to fly low in various cities, especially Ankara and Istanbul, and tanks taking to the streets in some of our cities.
The General Staff headquarters and the Gendarmerie General Command building in Ankara were seized by this group, and strategic places such as the MİT campus, various buildings of the Police Department, the Presidential Complex, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly were brutally attacked.
and vile attacks were carried out.
47 police officers lost their lives in the bombardment of the Special Operations Department buildings in Gölbaşı.
Many of our citizens lost their lives due to the fire opened by uniformed terrorists in tanks holding the entrance of the Bosphorus bridges.
Hundreds of our citizens lost their lives or were injured as a result of gunfire and bombardment in various places in Ankara, especially in front of the General Staff Headquarters.
A group that occupied the TRT General Directorate building forced them, at gunpoint, to read a pirated declaration on the screens, which was understood to have been prepared as an imitation of the old coups.
A similar statement was pirated and published on the website of the General Staff.
Again, with a small number of soldiers, the building of a media group in Istanbul was occupied, albeit for a short time.
Many of our citizens and municipal personnel lost their lives in the conflict in front of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.
After the start of the coup attempt, our Prime Minister informed the public through the media at around 23:00 and announced that the government was in power.
Members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, with the participation of deputies from all parties, revealed the attitude of the Gazi Parliament, which is the manifestation of the national will, against the coup attempt.
While this meeting was continuing, the Parliament was bombed with warplanes and helicopters by the group that attempted the coup.
We took immediate action against these developments.
We gave instructions to our relevant units and took the necessary steps to stop the coup attempt.
We invited everyone who loves our nation, their country, their homeland and their nation to take to the streets and claim their state and democracy.
Immediately afterwards, despite all the threats and dangers, we moved to Istanbul and showed our determined stance against the coup plotters together with my nation.
Neither the weapons, tanks, helicopters, nor planes of the coup plotters were of any use in the face of our nation's determined defense of its country and its will. If they have tanks and guns, tens of millions of citizens on the streets also have faith.
The attempts of the members of the evil gang, who did not take orders from their commanders and surrendered their will to the head of the Fethullahist terrorist organization instead of serving the nation and the state, failed in the face of the will of the nation and the determination of the state with all its institutions.
Those who shot at the nation without blinking their eyes thought that this nation would be afraid, leave the squares and streets to themselves, and retreat to their homes...
But our nation has never stepped back and left the field to the coup plotters, despite the fire opened on them, the bombs thrown, the threats made, and the people shot in front of their eyes.
Our nation took a historic stance against this coup attempt by joining hands with members of our Police Department and elements of the Turkish Armed Forces who took action against the coup plotters.
Our nation, which defended its country and its future with its upright stance against military-looking terrorists, especially the neutralization of tanks, has written countless heroic epics throughout the night.
All members of our nation, from young people with mustaches that have not yet grown to 70-year-olds, from workers to bosses, from villagers to city dwellers, have stood as one against the coup plotters, regardless of party, disposition or political opinion.
Our citizens, who stood against the traitors who attempted a coup, did not leave their places until the morning, even though dozens of people were shot, injured or martyred in front of them, behind them, on their right and left.
During all these incidents, 208 of our police officers and citizens, including my close colleagues, were martyred and nearly 1,500 people were injured, 232 of them seriously.
May God have mercy on our martyrs and their families, and I wish a speedy recovery to our wounded.
However, thank God, there was no news that there was a single civilian who took to the streets and supported the coup plotters anywhere in Turkey.
In this respect, the July 15 coup attempt will take its place in the glorious history of this nation as a great lesson that the nation gave to coup enthusiasts and will never be forgotten.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
First of all, I would like to specifically point out this point.
The July 15 coup attempt was a betrayal against our Turkish Armed Forces, as well as our entire nation.
Members of this organization, who took our Chief of General Staff, our Force Commanders, and many of our officers hostage at gunpoint and rendered them incapable of duty, are terrorists who cast a shadow on the dignity and honor of the uniforms they wear.
The fact that they are wearing uniforms does not change the fact that these terrorists are actually members of a treason gang.
Just like judges, prosecutors, police officers, and similar people in other institutions, who serve the same treason gang despite their uniforms and robes, traitors can emerge from within our army.
Turkish Armed Forces and our Mehmetçiks are the apple of our eye.
These cancer cells, which have spread to our Turkish Armed Forces, as well as to every institution of our country, through this coup attempt, will be quickly eliminated.
Essentially, preparations for this cleansing had already been started.
Members of the terrorist organization, who thought that the work carried out with the meticulousness of the rule of law, with the understanding of not unfairly victimizing anyone, was a weakness, with this initiative, they publicly revealed themselves and, in a sense, made our job easier.
The work that was already being carried out in other institutions, especially the judiciary and the police force, was accelerated following this development.
This terrorist organization, which consists of many channels, like a spider web, all connected to the same center, no longer has the opportunity to hide, hide or taqiyya.
Therefore, based on the July 15 coup attempt, we never accept any action or accusation that would put our Mehmetçik under suspicion or harm them.
The chain of command of the Turkish Armed Forces has proven its commitment to democracy and the rule of law by opposing this coup attempt.
It is only the coup supporters who try to legitimize the July 15 coup attempt and portray the uniformed terrorists and the forces behind them as victims, based on a number of images, most of which are false.
On July 15, Turkey faced a crossroads for which there was no exception, no explanation, no different explanation.
On the one hand, there is an attempt by members of the Fethullah Terrorist Organization and their supporters to take over our country, our nation, and our future; on the other hand, there is a nation that protects its will, democracy, independence and future at the expense of its life.
has.
Those who try to create a gray area between the coup attempters and the nation are, by default, members of a terrorist organization; because there is no such hesitant area.
The attempt is called treason.
Members of this terrorist organization will be subject to the same punishment as the punishment for treason anywhere in the world.

Such days are not the days when party bigotry, ideological obsessions, differences of disposition and opinion will be brought to the fore, and eyes will be darkened by personal hostilities.
Starting from the night of July 15, in all cities, squares and streets of Turkey, our citizens from every party, every opinion, every way of life, with the same feeling, the same excitement, the same determination, to protect their will, democracy and future.
has come together.
In the Turkish Grand National Assembly, with the joint signature of all political parties, the national will was supported against the coup attempt as one heart and one body.
Everyone who felt like a member of this country, a child of this nation, stood against this coup attempt.
Our nation, which has been suffering for years from not being able to protect Menderes and his friends in the 1960 coup and the youth who were sent to the gallows with the understanding of ""one from the right, one from the left"" in the 1980 coup, said ""stop"" to this trend on July 15, 2016.
For the first time in our country's history, an armed coup attempt of this scale was prevented by the nation itself.
Turkey has shown the whole world that it is a country where commitment to democracy and the rule of law is not just in words, but where these values ​​are put into practice at the expense of the lives of its citizens when necessary.
What happened after this coup attempt is not a weakness of our country's democracy, on the contrary, it is proof of how strong our democracy is.
Individuals or institutions, at home or abroad, who attempt to criticize our country for this reason only show that they are not truly democrats, but that they act with other calculations.
No democracy, no state of law will or can allow the existence of soldiers, judges, prosecutors, police officers and bureaucrats who receive orders from an outside organizational structure rather than from within the institutional hierarchy.
Otherwise, the superiority of democracy, that is, the national will; It is meaningless for the law, that is, rights and freedoms, to be guaranteed in writing.
The name of what those who want to take the country and the nation hostage by usurping the public power entrusted to them is fascism, dictatorship.
The July 15 coup attempt showed who the real fascists, the real dictatorship enthusiasts are in Turkey, and who the real democrats, real libertarians, and real supporters of the rule of law are.
My Dear Nation,
My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Our history is full of examples of the nation protecting its homeland and state, despite external attacks and internal betrayals.
The glorious resistance of July 15 will take its place at the very beginning of this magnificent history.
I believe that our nation's upright stance against the gun and tank barrels, airplane and helicopter bombs in the hands of these uniformed terrorists will be appreciated for generations.
I would like to express my gratitude to each of my citizens who took to the squares and streets with the emergence of the coup attempt and the call I made.
We cannot express our gratitude enough for each of our citizens who shielded themselves in front of tanks and prevented them from reaching their targets, who risked their lives for this, who were injured or martyred.
I would like to thank each and every one of my citizens who did not have the opportunity to go out but who hated the coup attempters with their prayers, hearts and tears at home until the morning.
I congratulate each of our MPs who, unlike past coups and coup attempts, quickly expressed their reaction to the July 15 coup attempt and protected the honor, dignity and dignity of the nation they represented with the declaration they published.
I do.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Chairman of our political parties for taking a strong stance on the side of democracy and national will, as it should be.
The political establishment protected its honor with its stance on July 15.
I would like to thank our municipalities, institutions, and citizens who used their personal vehicles for the same purpose, who deployed their construction equipment, buses, and all the tools and equipment they had to prevent the coup attempt.
Our Police Department and police officers are undoubtedly among those who contributed most to the failure of the July 15 coup attempt.
The first target of the treason gang that attempted the coup was the critical units of our Police Department, where they saw the potential to intervene.
They bombed our Special Operations Department in Gölbaşı with a plane and martyred our heroic police officers.
They bombed the Ankara Police Department building in the same way.
They tried to attack our Istanbul Police Department.
Despite this, our police officers made great sacrifices and never left their duties all over Turkey.
Using all the means at their disposal, they worked together with our nation to thwart the attempt of the members of the treason gang.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to every member of our Police Department who contributed greatly to the failure of this coup attempt.
One of the heroes of the July 15 coup attempt is our media.
Almost all of our media stood against the coup plotters and took a clear stance on the side of democracy and national will.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I congratulate each of our media members who took a very clear and firm stance against the members of the terrorist organization who attempted a coup despite the threat of weapons.
Of course, one of the most important thanks goes to the commanders of our Turkish Armed Forces who opposed the coup attempt and kept the forces under their command out of this vile attempt, and our soldiers who did not take part in this betrayal despite the pressure.
I would like to express my gratitude to all our officers and soldiers who show that they are members of the nation's army, not prisoners of any organization or individual.
During this process, I would also like to express my gratitude to the countries, heads of state and government, and friendly and brotherly communities who supported the legitimate administration in Turkey, either by calling in person, by sending messages, or by making a statement to the media.
My Dear Nation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Just as there is a morning at the end of every night, and ease at the end of every difficulty, new opportunities emerge after such painful events.
As a nation, we have faced countless such threats, attacks and attempts throughout our thousand-year existence in the Anatolian geography.
100 years ago, with the strength we received from the rise of our nation, which was said to be unable to stand up anymore, in Çanakkale and Kutü'l Amare, we fought the War of Independence and made it successful.
Throughout the history of the Republic, attacks, traps and betrayals against our country and nation did not stop and continued.
Whenever Turkey was about to make a move, attempts were made to block its path, power and strength through coups, juntas, economic, political and social crises.
Thanks to the stability and trust environment it has achieved in the past 14 years, our country has entered a new period of growth in every field, from economic balances to investments, from the defense industry to exports.
We know that the picture of Turkey, which is starting to have a say in its region and in the world and whose voice is getting louder, disturbs some people a lot.
We also know very well that all terrorist organizations operating in our country, including the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization, are the product of a project and have been released on us for certain purposes.
In these lands, scoundrels who will attack their own nation with tanks, planes or helicopters will never grow.
All of these are mankurts who have been specially raised, trained and brainwashed for many years as part of an insidious plan.
Whatever you say to these people who have eyes but cannot see, ears but cannot hear, tongues but cannot speak is in vain...
For 3 years, we have been trying to explain to this group the wrong path they are taking and the betrayal of the ringleaders they follow.
Just like our citizens who sympathize with other terrorist organizations, we made a patient and common sense effort to help them open their eyes and see the truth, open their ears and hear the truth, loosen their tongues and confess the truth. Even me
I made a clear definition as ""its base is worship, its middle is commerce, and its ceiling is treason"".
From now on, not the slightest tolerance or mercy will be shown to those who support either the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization or other terrorist organizations.
For us, the survival of our nation and state comes before everything else.
Without compromising the principles of democracy and the rule of law, a relentless fight will be waged against all terrorist organizations and all structures that threaten the future of our nation and state.
Turkey, with its state and nation, has demonstrated its will to firmly adhere to the four basic pillars that I have always expressed, against the July 15 coup attempt, leaving no room for doubt.
One, one nation. My dear brothers and sisters, this nation, with its Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Roma, Bosnians, Albanians, in short, 79 million people, will not be able to divide us.
Two, one flag. The color of our flag is the blood of our martyrs. The crescent is the expression of our independence. The star is our martyr himself.
Three, what makes flags flags is the blood on them. If you died in pursuit of land it is the motherland. This homeland is the only homeland with 780 thousand square kilometers, no one can carry out any operations on it.
Fourth, one state. A state within a state can never be accepted. This parallel state structure, this treason network has set such a goal for itself. Now we need all of this from all our institutions, our Armed Forces, our Police Department, our National Intelligence,
All our ministries, we will clean them, purify them and make them clean.
Because we will be united around these principles, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together.
There is no other way, no other alternative, no other option before us.
Turkey has no alternative other than democracy, the rule of law, and a system where fundamental rights and freedoms are guaranteed, there is no other way to go.
I am speaking clearly:
There can be no obstacle to peace, stability and development in a Turkey that keeps its unity, solidarity and brotherhood strong.
In the past, we paid a heavy price for the understanding of governing the nation despite the nation.
No one has the right to make our nation pay the price, no matter what the rhetoric or for what purpose.
Turkey only needs to grow, strengthen, develop, increase its welfare, strengthen its defense, strengthen its education, health, justice system and infrastructure.
As the first President of the Republic of Turkey who came to power directly by the vote of the nation, my only goal is to build this Turkey.
As the President, we will continue on our way with the determination to reach our country's 2023 goals together with our Parliament, our Government, our political parties, non-governmental organizations and everyone who supports Turkey.
All indicators in the economy show that the stagnation that has been going on for a while has begun to be left behind.
We are completing our big projects one by one and starting to take steps for new ones.
Here, we will open the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge on August 26th. Then, on December 26, we will hopefully open the Eurasia Tunnel, the tunnel under the Bosphorus where cars go and come. Meanwhile, on the one hand, on the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge
Hopefully, the tender for our high-speed train, the tender preparations for the Çanakkale Bridge on the other hand, and the tender preparations for our Canal Istanbul project on the other hand, are continuing rapidly. Giant projects in different regions of our country are also progressing rapidly.
We have taken important steps towards re-establishing strong relations by leaving behind the problems we have experienced with the countries around us, and we continue to do so.
No one should have any doubt that this situation was one of the reasons for the July 15 coup attempt.
I request from all institutions of the economy, all actors, and my entire nation:
We should definitely not allow the failed coup attempt of the parallel treason gang to spoil this positive picture.
It is the expectation of hundreds of millions of people, together with our 79 million citizens, that Turkey, which is the hope of the victims and oppressed in its region and all over the world, will stand tall and not only grow stronger.
We cannot leave these brothers humbled and heartbroken.
We have not made happy those who were wringing their hands and waiting for Turkey to fall into trouble, kneel down, and give up, and we will not make them happy tomorrow either.
May God help us.
May God protect and preserve this nation, this country forever. Once again, I wish God's mercy to all our martyrs and I wish God's recovery to our wounded. I hope our unity will last forever.
Stay well.
",2023-07-15,The coup attempt was suppressed.,after
Their Speech at the 14th Mukhtars' Meeting,2015-11-04,"

Our dear headmen,
My dear brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation.
We are together for the 14th of our Mukhtars Meeting, which we have been holding since January. Today, we are hosting you, our esteemed headmen from Aydın, Balıkesir, Becek, Bolu, Denizli, Düzce, Eskişehir, Istanbul, Kocaeli, Konya and Yalova, in the people's home.
We aim to come together with all the headmen in our country in this way and relieve their longing.
Our neighborhoods and villages, which are the smallest units of our country's administrative organization, are the first step of democracy with our elected headmen. The president, who is at the top of the management organization, and the base of this structure
The stronger and healthier the bond between our headmen, the better it will be for Turkey. The opinions and evaluations of our headmen, who are in direct face-to-face communication with our nation every day, are very important to us in this respect.
In this regard, I would especially like to state here that we will continue our meetings with our headmen and that we will always keep the relationship between us alive and strong. Of course, I want you to know that there are people who are disturbed by this situation, I know them.
I see.
In the last period of the Ottoman Empire and the first period of the Republic, so-called intellectuals such as Abdullah Cevdet did not hesitate to openly express that they did not like their nation because they did not think like them. He even proposed to replace this nation with another race from outside.
Unfortunately, we still encounter these mankurts today, who go so far as to do so. The sphere of influence of this group, who feel entitled to inflict all kinds of insults on the nation that does not follow the direction they have determined within the framework of their ideological obsessions, is thankfully shrinking.
Our nation has always taught them the lesson they deserve throughout history with its wisdom, foresight and wisdom, and continues to do so today at every opportunity. As a citizen and a politician who came out of the nation, we have been with our people throughout our lives.
We adopted walking as our motto. We have not, and do not, consider any authority other than the consent of Allah, or any authority other than the national will. That's why this brother of yours is the first President of Turkey to come to power with the direct vote of the people.
It is a separate source of happiness. We will continue on this path of service together with our nation and our headmen, who are their first level representatives, until we reach our goals, with God's permission. May Allah guide us from the path of service to the nation and our book, the Quran.
He should not separate the straight path from the righteous with his expression.
Dear brothers and sisters,
We had a historic election in our country last Sunday. First of all, I would like to thank all my citizens who voted for the future of their country and themselves in this election. High participation in the elections means that our nation defends its will.
is the indicator. I hope to God that the election results will be beneficial for our country, nation and region. I congratulate all our newly elected or re-elected MPs. To our political parties represented in the parliament,
I wish you success in the term.
As it is known, the November 1 elections were an early election, a repeat of the June 7 elections, and I have stated this many times. The June 7 elections revealed a parliamentary picture that Turkey has not been accustomed to for many years. Türkiye since November 2002
For the first time, the Parliament faced a situation where a political party could not form a government on its own. In the period starting from before the June 7 elections until November 1, some politicians and parties were accused of threatening the stability and trust environment of the country.
We followed his statements and policies together, you watched them too, I watched them too. Frankly, we saw that most of the political parties represented in the Parliament were unable to evaluate the results of the June 7 elections correctly.
The discourses, which started with the enthusiasm of the 60 percent block on the election night and escalated with a revanchist approach, left Turkey facing a difficult test. It is artificial and impossible to implement, designed at the table, ignoring a party that received 41 percent of the votes.
Non-existent political engineering projects were tried to be imposed on the parties and the nation. During this process, we witnessed and witnessed that the environment of peace and trust that we had established with great efforts and sacrifices during my 12-year term as Prime Minister was in danger.
The separatist terrorist organization and a party that openly stated that it relied on it made every effort to return Turkey to the days when blood, tears and chaos dominated.
My brothers,
How do you, as headmen and above you as mayors, evaluate the streets and alleys being made uninhabitable by opening canals? As headmen, wouldn't you go crazy? Because this is a betrayal, they are a betrayal network.
If the municipality is going to open a canal on my street where I will live in peace, it will either be a drinking water canal or a wastewater canal. Or like TEDAŞ - private companies are now buying it - they come, open channels for infrastructure, and then
They also close. But on the contrary, such channels were opened not for this reason, but so that security forces could not enter those places and citizens could not move freely. And what did they do this with? They did it with municipal work machines. After that, how did they close it?
They gave jobs to their supporters here by procuring services and transferred the money to the terrorist organization through there. These have been done. All this is being followed; All of these are followed by our Ministry of Internal Affairs with all civil inspectors, and
These will be done.
An attempt was made to confine Turkey to an agenda full of conflict news and the pain of our martyrs and their families. Likewise, the evil network we call the parallel state structure mobilized all its means to attack Turkey's gains.
Those who see themselves as the flagship of our country's media also participated in and supported this betrayal of separatist and parallel terrorist organizations. Unfortunately, a group of business people who need an environment of stability and trust the most also joined this chorus.
I hold meetings here, a businessman said the following in a meeting I held. He is a person from the Southeast and took on a road job that had been on hold for 11 years. Just like in the west, what we call concrete asphalt, which is durable for many years, is built on top of it with more concrete.
Then he will build this kind of road where cold and hot asphalt is laid... This work has been going on for 11 years. He said, 'I won the tender for that road, I am building it, and all those working with me are my Kurdish brothers, they are working.' They come, they threaten, 'Your boss
'He will pay this much money, he will pay taxes, if he doesn't, this place will be burned down.' Since it is not given, they burn 20 construction machines and trucks. They also burn the construction site manager's own car, which he bought in installments. 'I am also a Kurd, look, we are doing a very good job here,
This was a road where we always had accidents, now we are building a road here like in the west, don't do it, don't do it.' Even though he said 'don't do it', they burned his car too.
My dear brothers and sisters;
While the separatist terrorist organization shed blood every day, took lives, and made the roads and streets uninhabitable with the bombs they planted, all these groups made an extraordinary effort to hold the government and even myself accountable for this. What did they say? 'Join
state'. What did they say? 'Killer Palace'. We have never thought of anything in this country other than service. And our whole concern was service in this country. We always said something; 'Whatever happens in the developed countries and the western world today will happen in my country. my country
Whatever is in the west will be in the east and in the southeast, and whatever is in the north will be in the south.' Remember when we come; Turkey had 26 airports, but now there are 55 airports. Go to the far east, there is the airport, leave your home and you will be at the airport in half an hour.
Who would believe us if we talked about these 15 years ago? Who would have believed that an airport would be built in Ağrı? Who would have believed that an airport would be built in Muş and Hakkari, who would have believed that an airport would be built in Iğdır? I ask, who would have believed that an airport would be built in Şırnak? These
we did it.
In other words, we did not accept discrimination. Just as my citizen in the west is my brother, my citizen in the east and southeast, whether Kurdish or Zaza, is also my brother. Why? These are my brothers because the God who created me also created them. Unfortunately
This complex process, in which all kinds of lies, slander, hypocrisy, arrogance, rudeness and intransigence were exhibited, really disturbed our nation.
They were not content with just fueling this fire of discord at home, they also organized and carried out campaigns against our country abroad. For example, while on the one hand, he called on German Chancellor Merkel, who visited our country, to 'come', on the other hand, he made various statements.
They gathered the academics, writers and journalists they could influence in the countries and had them publish declarations. They did not have the decency to ask, 'Is this really the truth of the matter?' Or they did not have the decency to come to Turkey and ask, 'Is this country really like this?'
They didn't show it. In other words, they signed the paper without recognizing Turkey.
It was unthinkable for me to be a spectator, to wait on the sidelines, to remain silent in the face of this difficult situation that Turkey was going through. In fact, if you remember, what did I say last year before August 10? I said, 'I will not be a conventional President.' always expression
As I said, my side is clear. Some say; You have to 'be impartial'. Being impartial is about rights, but I am taking sides. Who am I on? I am on the side of the nation, I am on the side of the nation. I have to protect whatever the interests of my nation require.
I have to be with you.
As the President, when a coalition government could not be formed under the umbrella of the Parliament, I took Turkey to new elections, based on the authority given to me by the Constitution. They made a lot of criticisms, things like this and that, 'The President is taking sides' or something like that.
etc... Again, I said something to our headmen here; 'Is it possible to go to Beştepe with people who do not know the way?' I said this. Until today, we have an understanding that sees the nation and national will as the solution to all our problems. This time we used the same method.
We wanted the solution to be sought in the nation and the will of the nation, not in the centers of power outside or within, terrorism or chaos. Look, the will of the nation was manifested immediately and the job was completed. Thank God, our nation did not embarrass us. Once again, it is ours to him.
It confirmed our trust, confidence and submission. We have always respected the people's choices until now, and we will continue to do so from now on.
Hopefully, Turkey is now leaving behind a difficult period that was first sparked by the Gezi events, taken one step further with the December 17-25 coup attempt, and further escalated by separatist terrorism. From now on, we will devote all our time, energy and opportunities to our 2023 goals,
We will concentrate on solving the problems in our region and our vision of a great and powerful new Türkiye.
My dear brothers and sisters;
I believe that the November 1 elections should be read and evaluated very well. Frankly, after the June 7 elections, our political parties did not - or could not - pass a very good test in this regard. Reaching a compromise for the interests of the nation and the country
Instead, our nation showed at the ballot box that it did not approve of these policies of the parties who preferred to act in line with their own calculations.
Of course, this job did not end here, it never ends. Our nation gave the message on November 1, 'I do not want a coalition, I want to continue on my way with a strong single-party government.' Again, our nation is against those who adopt the methods of terrorist organizations instead of the legitimate opportunities of politics.
He clearly stated that this path was wrong. Those who turned to excesses that meant the domination of the minority over the majority were once again warned and warned by our nation through the ballot box. Is there a better way than this? If we are going to do politics,
This is where it goes. Not with guns, not with digging roads.
The November 1 elections showed that this nation does not allow any policies or initiatives that would take Turkey away from an environment of stability and trust. In this country, any party that does not prioritize democracy, peace, development and progress will not be a priority for our nation.
It became clear that he could not gain his appreciation and support. Anyone who wants to see the distinction between those who speak out specifically to the nation and those who seek support from different focuses inside and outside should analyze the results of November 1 very well. of the country and
Those who produce politics for the future of the nation and those who defend the new Turkey; Those who act with the discourses and reflexes of the old Turkey were seen once again in this election.
November 1 is also extremely important in terms of reinforcing the power of democracy and the dominance of the national will in Turkey. Our nation is against terrorism, terrorist organizations, those who rely on them, all kinds of parallel structures and those who cannot demonstrate the necessary acumen against them.
He expressed his message clearly. Social engineering efforts were again unsuccessful in the face of national will. Our nation has shown that it stands by the locals, that is, you and those who take a national stance, and protects its future. We repeat at every opportunity
There is one thing, I believe everyone from 7 to 70 will understand this; One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state...
My dear brothers and sisters;
With 78 million people, from the west to the east, from the north to the south, we include Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Arabs, Georgians, Bosnians, Roma, Zazas, anyone. My 78 million precious brothers, we are one nation. Once we accept this, we will make each other a place,
Position, race, that's why we won't love; We will love each other for God's sake. In other words, no one should love me because I am the President, no one should love someone because he has a lot of money, no one should love him because of his position. My brothers; Remember we will all die, this is your brother
He will also die and on the day they bury us in the grave, no one will say that this was the president. Hodja Effendi will say, 'For the purpose of a private' and they will bury him that way. But as Baki said, we are happy if we left a pleasant sound in this dome; That's the point... And it's a nice sound
We are happy if we were able to make our President say 'May God bless our President', that's the point... If you can't do this, woe to you, then you're screwed. Now we will protect the message of November 1. We are one nation, we will love each other
my brothers. We will not fall for the tricks of Kurdism, Turkism, this and that. Say I am Turkish, I am Kurdish, I am Arab, I am Laz, I am Georgian, I am Bosnian, I am Roma; But don't be Romanist, don't be Kurdish, don't be Turkist, that's the point...
When we do this, we will be divided. Let's not forget, we are citizens of the Republic of Turkey, we need to walk with this awareness. Why are they dividing us, why are they tearing us apart? What was missing, what investment did we not make here? We are currently serving the Southeast-East regions
Our investment is 260 quadrillion. There is no such investment in the history of the Republic. From schools, hospitals, all infrastructure to transportation, all these investments have been made and are still being made. But we make it, you burn it
You are destroying. Currently, there are universities in all 81 provinces. When I took office, we had 76 universities, now there are 193 universities.
Why did we do these? My brother in Hakkari is poor, his child will go to university, he may not be able to send his child to Istanbul, he may not be able to send his child to Ankara, he may not be able to send his child to Izmir; Let us bring the university to their doorstep, they can easily send their child to university.
so that you can send it. But if you raid the university that comes to your door, if you try to destroy it with bombs, excuse me, if you threaten the academics and faculty members there, we will not be able to send even a professor or an associate professor there. Because their
We also have to ensure life safety somewhere. But these make our job difficult. That's why I treat these faculty members who work as academics in the Southeast and the East as heroes, just as our Mehmetçik are, our police are heroic, our village guards are heroes.
If he is a hero, I especially see our academics, our healthcare workers and all our teachers as patriotic heroes and I applaud them as such.
And of course, a message, a single flag... We do not recognize any flag other than our current flag, such a thing cannot happen. And I always say; 'What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if anyone dies for it.' This flag is not a riot of colours.
Our flag is the blood of our martyr, the crescent is the expression of our independence, and the star is the symbol of our martyr. This meaning is very deep. But these gentlemen say, 'We have no problem with the flag.' Well, he runs away whenever he sees our flag. But sometimes he does this for show, 7
Just like they did in June. And here they are, in their own coffins, where they lay them on a rag; After that he says 'I have no problem with the flag'. What's this?
Dear brothers and sisters,
I believe that, through you, our headmen, and through my nation who is watching us on their screens right now, we will hopefully correct these mistakes and walk together to much different, brighter days. And of course, one homeland... 780 thousand square kilometers
We do not carry out operations on our homeland. Look, right now, all our security forces, our soldiers, our police, all our village guards are all in the region, they do not say anything. We also have martyrs. It is our children who are walking there, which is the highest position after prophethood.
We have, we have brothers. I know families are very troubled at this point. But we also need to know that; That rank of martyrdom is such a rank that it is a rank earned by those who march for God and the country, it is not ordinary. And hopefully, with this struggle, their blood will also be shed.
It won't stay on the ground. Of course, there is also the state... There is no state within the state. We have only one state, the Republic of Türkiye, that's all; It cannot be another state.
Of course, one of the most important messages of November 1 is; Turkey needs to solve the new constitution issue as soon as possible. The nation is waiting for this, right? Waiting. Now, I was the prime minister during the preparations for the new constitution. I said; 'We need our numbers
'We do not want as many commission memberships, let all 4 parties provide three members each, so we can do this work.' However, at that time, our number was close to 330, the opposition's number was 220. They were represented with 9 members, our party was represented with 3 members. Look, 9 to 220
Our party, which has nearly 330 members, has 3 members. And yet we said; 'It's not about the vinedresser, let's eat the grapes together, that's our problem.' But unfortunately, they all ran away from the table and we couldn't finish the job. Even a certain distance has been covered. We said, 'Let's at least legalize these?'
They escaped in this one too. I hope that in the new period, they will not hesitate to contribute to the preparations of this new constitution, they will solve this by sitting at the table together, and the parties that seek to obstruct it will give up this understanding...
Anyone who resists and acts obstructively in the face of our nation's demand for a new constitution will be held accountable for this in the elections to be held 4 years later. With the Parliament starting to actually work, this issue will be addressed sincerely by our parties.
I believe that it will be taken into consideration and a study will be initiated to achieve results. We discussed this with our Prime Minister, albeit briefly, when I visited him yesterday, and they said that he would also hold this meeting with other opposition parties regarding the new constitution.
My hope is that a good result will be obtained here as well. All issues that were the subject of discussion in the past period are discussed and discussed during the preparation of the new constitution, and if a consensus is reached, they are brought before the nation. I am also the President
Whatever duty falls upon me, I will fully support it without any delay, and I would like it to be put into practice by my nation as soon as possible. Here too, it is our duty to respect the will of the Parliament and the nation, provided that our personal opinions are reserved.
It is your duty.
Dear brothers and sisters,
The election results were welcomed with joy not only in Turkey, but also in a wide geography from the Balkans to Central Asia, from Africa to the Middle East, who had pinned their hopes on this country and this nation, because as Turkey gets stronger, as Turkey grows, Turkey gains stability and confidence.
As they continue on their way in this climate, these brothers and sisters have the opportunity to look to their future with hope. We want, along with our 78 million citizens, to embrace all the victims, the oppressed, and the strange in our region and around the world, and to help them achieve their dreams.
Let's reunite. Let's not forget one thing: 78 million people have to accept this office as their own office, because this is the office of the people, not my own office. You may like Tayyip Erdoğan or you may not, I have no problem with him, but you cannot insult him here.
You can't call this place 'murderer'. For this purpose, we are working in the spirit of mobilization with all our relevant public institutions and non-governmental organizations, and we will continue to do so. Today, our red and star flags are the flags of our public institutions and non-governmental organizations.
Wherever he goes in the world, he is accepted wholeheartedly and welcomed with tears. Could there be greater happiness than this for a country, for a nation?
Here you see it, you follow it; Turkey has been hosting and sheltering 2.5 million brothers and sisters from Syria and Iraq for 4.5 years. We are doing something like this, having opened our hearts to almost 500 thousand people in one province, in all of Istanbul.
European countries, on the other hand, panicked at the 150-200 thousand refugees arriving at their doors in recent months. They are not poorer than us, they are much richer than us. Why did you panic, why did you panic? They almost fell for each other, so Europe
They even opened the future of the Union to discussion, there are those who say 'we will leave, we will withdraw'. While European countries are trying to forcibly send back or even sink ships and boats approaching their countries from the Mediterranean, we have collected 65 thousand victims from the sea since the beginning of the year.
We saved their lives. Our Coast Guard boats collect them at night or during the day, take them to shelters and then send them to their countries. While we open our doors to everyone who comes to our country with a humane and conscientious understanding, European countries still provide education,
It strives to select people according to their beliefs, abilities, age and health. Impossible. He doesn't look at it as a human; What is its adjective, what is its education and training? Impossible. First, you will look at him as a human being, say that he is a human being, and provide the necessary support.
Of course, the problems in Syria and Iraq will end one day, we have absolute faith in this. These people will regain their country, their cities, their country, their homes. At that time, the only thing that comes to mind is the humanitarian stance displayed by Turkey and the emergence of Western countries.
This shameful attitude will remain. We will continue to support these brothers then too. Remember, we are members of such a civilization that in our civilization, those who extend a helping hand are called Ansar, and those who rely on the doors opened by those Ansar are called Muhajir.
We are now approaching those people with this awareness, because they escaped from those bombs, they escaped from those barrel bombs. They escaped from a country where state terrorism was inflicted, from the bullets fired at them by terrorists who wanted to invade their entire country.
We couldn't close our doors to them, so we opened our doors. Now some say, 'it's time to embrace'. Can there be a bigger hug than this? No one should encourage us to embrace, we know how to embrace very well, as long as the other person embraces us.
Let him know how to embrace.
My dear brothers and sisters, the borders of our country are different, and especially the borders of our hearts are completely different. The late Abdurrahim Karakoç said it beautifully:
“While blooming in the land of your hands,
Snow is coming with us, my friend.
Who drew this border in my heart?
It's getting tight, it's getting tight, brother.
Three-month-old babies were held to stones,
Enemies are watching from behind.
The Creator is like this, don't let it happen to you,
""It's hard, it's hard, my brother.""
Yes, it sounds difficult. The borders of our hearts are wide enough to include every place where our brothers live. We pray that God should not give us something like this for what happened in our region. Ah, let's put ourselves in their shoes, what would we do? If you bring us to your land
Let's think about what we would do if there was no one to accept it... See? So, since we have no homeland other than this homeland, I am sorry to those who try to make this homeland miserable for us, we will make this homeland miserable, they should know that as well.
As the children of a nation that knows very well what the War of Independence is, we must and will continue to support our brothers who are fighting for this independence until the end.
Look, we have spent 8 billion dollars so far, have we ever reflected this on our nation? My Lord gives His blessings. Some people say corruption, this and that. They are in treason. Can a government with corruption make these investments?
can he do it? Currently, America, England and Turkey are the top three countries in the world that lend a helping hand to the oppressed people of the world. We are a country that gave 4.5 billion dollars to these poor people in the world in 2014. But no matter what they do, we will not trip them up.
We won't get stuck, we will continue on our way.
I recommend that those who want to use the political uncertainty that Turkey entered after June 7 to deepen the problems in the region should reconsider their calculations, this will not happen. If we love this country, if we love this nation
Let's join hands, join hands and overcome the problems in this country together as soon as possible. Alhamdulillah, Türkiye is now in a position to surpass many countries in the world in its growth rate.
Look, we will hold the G-20 meeting in Antalya on November 15-16. The giants of the world will gather here, the countries that make up 85 percent of the world economy will come together under our presidency. And this brother of yours will manage these meetings. All
Regardless of the layers of the economy, we will take such a step with an understanding that will cover all of them, from young people to women, disabled people, and all small and medium-sized businesses. And in terms of investments; How should we invest until 2030?
So that we can achieve the goal together? We will discuss these, we will talk about these. But we will also talk about implementation, how will we implement these, how will we do them? How did each country achieve these in its own country? How did we succeed as Türkiye, how do we succeed?
We will always bring these to the agenda there. My dear brothers and sisters, hopefully we will announce an Antalya declaration to the world with the final declaration.
These are, of course, very important developments and very important steps for our country. When we took office, we were ranked 24th in the world, now we are in the 17th ranked economy and among the G-20 countries, we are in such a position. We will talk about the future of Syria, the future of Iraq
We will talk, we will talk about the future of the people there. Dear brothers and sisters, we will talk especially about Syria and Iraq, how we can make them make decisions within the framework of their own historical, cultural, ethnic and sectarian realities. Until our region finds peace,
As Turkey, we will continue our struggle until people can look to their future with confidence.
Dear brothers and sisters,
I believe that the coming period will be a period in which we will hopefully renew the democracy and development move we have experienced since November 3, 2002, 13 years ago. May our nation be of peace, do not worry, tomorrow will be better than today,
Don't worry. The operations against the terrorist organization inside and outside the country continue with determination, there is no interruption, we will continue. Until the terrorist organization lays down its weapons and buries it with concrete in the ground, all its members must surrender or leave the country.
We will continue this struggle until we are liquidated by quitting. Likewise, until the organization's structures in the cities are completely destroyed, the operations of our security forces will continue fairly and administrative prosecutions will continue. The coming period is a period of conversation and debate.
Not, I'm saying it frankly, it's a period of getting results.
If a name is needed for this process, it is called the process of national unity and brotherhood. So, can there be a better power than our national unity? Could there be anything more beautiful than brotherhood? If anyone says national unity, if anyone says brotherhood, we are all under the same roof.
We must gather under; There is no other way out of this, we have to do this. We do not and will not have the slightest tolerance towards this threat to our unity, solidarity and brotherhood.
No one can ignore or ignore the great transformation that Turkey has experienced in the past 13 years. The state now respects the beliefs, origins, culture, language, thoughts and all differences of its citizens, and the freedom and opportunity required for this.
No one can deny what you gave them. My brothers, we abolished the policies of rejection, we abolished the policies of denial, we abolished the policies of assimilation. Until this brother of yours became prime minister, none of the prime ministers ever called a Kurdish citizen 'my brother'.
He could not say this, but this brother of yours called the Kurdish citizen 'my brother'. I was a prime minister who visited all the Southeastern provinces, even reaching their districts in some places. Now, as President, I continue in the same way, and I will do so again. Why? 780 thousand square kilometers
That's why it's our responsibility, 78 million people are our responsibility. We will do this; We will do it here and we will do it there too. Why? We want state-nation unification. The state was in the front when we came, the people were behind. What did we say? 'Human first
Then we said 'state'.
When we first arrived, I wandered around Anatolia and established our party; ""What do you want?"" I said. All the opinion leaders in the Southeast and the East always told me this at that time: ""Just lift this state of emergency."" And we founded our party, first election after 16 months,
We came to power with 34.4 percent on our own, but 63 percent of the Parliament. I was not a member of parliament, I was the chairman. Mr. Prime Minister at that time, Abdullah Gül, and we lifted the state of emergency in the first month. Why? Because we were saying: 'We will neither be deceptive nor
We will be deceived.' We lifted the state of emergency, and after that, new demands came one after another, and we tried to fulfill all of them as they came, we still do and we will. 'If a horse does not know how to fish in the sea, Halik does'; This is our understanding. Here is all
While these facts are obvious, trying to wage a struggle with oppression, violence, weapons, blood, lives and ditches is the greatest betrayal of this country and this nation. In this respect, the separatist terrorist organization and the party under its control have had a very bad test since last year.
It does, I have to say this clearly. We have a responsibility towards the 160 martyrs we lost, the 185 citizens we lost, and the hundreds of security guards and citizens who were injured since the Suruç attack in July.
He says - as if he is challenging - '2 thousand Kurdish people were killed by the state.' I'm sorry, you need to learn this once and for all: This state will never shoot Kurdish people. This state fires bullets at terrorists, you need to know this once and for all. We have terrorists
He is different, my Kurdish brother is different; Let's separate these once. No one should regard my Kurdish brother as a terrorist; It's different, it's different. We will separate these from each other. But who is my Mehmetçik, my police officer, my village founder brother?
If he points his gun, he will pay the price. My brothers and sisters all over my country, be they Kurds, Turks, Laz, Circassians, Arabs, Georgians, Roma,
We have a responsibility to all of them, no matter who they are. Most importantly, we will fulfill our responsibility towards our nation, because this responsibility comes before everything else. We have never tortured the souls of our martyrs and we never will. In this country
We will not give up this struggle until there is not a single weapon, not a single bomb, not a single trap left directed against the state and the nation.
Of course, along with the fight against terrorism, another priority of ours is the determination to leave a stronger, more prosperous and greater Turkey to the next generations. This is our goal. For this reason, we will accelerate our 2023 projects and ensure their implementation.
For example, the new airport under construction in Istanbul will hopefully be one of the top 3 airports in the world. The first phase will be opened at the beginning of 2018, and the entirety will be completed in 2023-2024. It is an airport with a passenger capacity of between 150 million and 200 million per year.
Our 3rd bridge across the Bosphorus, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge... It is currently continuing rapidly. While connecting Asia and Europe, this bridge will also meet the airport, it has such a feature. There is also the Eurasia tunnel; where? of Marmaray
Just south of it, hopefully it will be completed in early 2016 and vehicles will pass through it too. Marmaray is already a rail system, it currently continues to carry passengers intensively under the sea. Everyone was saying 'they can't do it, they can't do it'. We did it, do you believe you can do it?
If you are determined, you can do it. Our grandfather the Conqueror carried the ships overland, and Byzantium was shocked when they saw the ships in the Golden Horn. If we are his grandchildren, we need to continue in their footsteps, the steps they took, so we did it from under the sea. Now the second submarine, here it is
I hope it is almost finished and vehicles will pass through there too.
My dear brothers and sisters, the Istanbul-Izmir highway continues rapidly and hopefully it will reduce the distance between Izmir and Istanbul to 3 hours; These are great steps. And the bridge continues rapidly there too, the roads continue on one side and Istanbul, Kocaeli, of course Kocaeli's
A journey from Karamürsel, from there to Iznik Bursa, from there to Izmir via Manisa... And Izmit Gulf Crossing Bridge, high-speed train lines, tunnels, nuclear power plants... I hope the next step will be taken, we promised this a long time ago,
Steps such as Canal Istanbul will definitely achieve their goals. And of course, we will hopefully add new ones to these, especially the Çanakkale Bosphorus Bridge.
We will continue the rise that has been going on for the last 13 years in education, health, social assistance and all other areas by raising the bar even higher. Until we completely eliminate Turkey's foreign dependency in the defense industry, we will be one of the world's leading companies in this field.
We will work with all our strength until we become one of the coming countries. There is no stopping until we become a country that not only produces but also designs products based on advanced technology.
We will continue reforms until we become a country set as an example in democracy, freedom and law. There are those who cannot tolerate us, but they should know this: They will tolerate us, because this country will lead most of the Western countries to freedom before God.
has the ability.
We have never given up and will never give up on our goal of making Turkey one of the 10 most developed economies in the world in 2023. These are no longer the goals of any party or government, but of Turkey, the goals of our nation; like this
we will see.
Turkey, which started its life with serious concerns, hesitations and troubles on the morning of November 1, closed the night of the same day with great hope, great excitement and great happiness. Now, of course, I want to say something in particular here: Some people say that
He always talks about hugging. Okay, we are ready, thank you; but you never embraced it... You said; 'We are worried that a civil war will break out on November 2.' How do you talk about civil war in this country? If those who expect civil war in this country
If there are, they are a treason network, treason... That expectation is the expectation of terrorist organizations, to drag this country into civil war. But these are the darkness that pretend to be enlightened. Those who live with the dream of civil war in this country should know that the Republic of Turkey was first created by God with all its institutions.
He is standing tall and has the strength and ability to account for this; Everyone should know this too.
Hopefully, we will continue on our way with greater enthusiasm and greater faith after the Parliament convenes and the new government is established, in line with the deadlines specified in the Constitution.
While saying all this, I would like to state that, as the President, he expresses the feelings of my nation. As the President of Turkey's 78 million citizens and all 81 provinces, I have nothing but the goodness, beauty and charity of my country and nation.
I do not want, it is not possible for me to wish. Every word I say, every criticism I make, every proposal I express should be evaluated within this framework. To be united, to be big, to be alive, to be brothers, to be Turkey all together, from the government to the opposition.
All political parties and all segments of society need to step forward. We need this for our future. As President, I strive to pave the way and encourage this issue. We will work together more on this issue in the coming period.
We must make an effort.
With these thoughts, I once again pray to God that the November 1 elections will be beneficial for our country, our nation and our region. I congratulate our political parties and MPs, all of whom I see as the winners of the race for democracy.
I would like to express my gratitude to every member of our nation for their contribution to the manifestation of the national will. They cast their votes abroad at an increasing rate in each election, coming from that 4-hour, 5-hour journey to the polls for hours on the subject of Turkey's future.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to express my gratitude to my citizens abroad who are waiting in the queue for expressing their preferences.
I would like to thank each and every one of you for gracing the Presidential Complex, the house of the nation. I ask you to convey my greetings, respect and affection to each of my brothers in your neighborhoods and villages. May you be alive and well.
My brothers, we will be together for dinner soon, and as you know, our Ministry of Internal Affairs is running the secretariat of this matter. Our headmen will fill out all their troubles and troubles in the form distributed to them, and a commission there will follow up on them.
These follow-ups will continue in the same way and hopefully the deficiencies will be fulfilled to the maximum extent.
For now, I greet you with love and respect and pray that God will be our friend and helper.

",2023-11-01,The AK Party became the sole government again with 317 deputies.,after
Their Speech at the 13th Mukhtars' Meeting,2015-10-26,"

Our dear headmen,
My dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt affection. Welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation.
We are together for the 13th of our Mukhtars Meeting, which we have been holding since January. Today, we invite you, our valued headmen from Afyonkarahisar, Ağrı, Ankara, Antalya, Ardahan, Bayburt, Bingöl, Çanakkale, İstanbul, Kars, Rize, Şanlıurfa and Trabzon provinces.
We host.
We aim to come together with all the headmen in our country in this way and relieve their longing. Yesterday, we were together with our MEMUR-SEN brothers, that is, our civil servants, at the Ankara Arena Sports Hall. The other day, Saturday, in Gaziantep, first at Hasan Kalyoncu University,
Then we met with our young people at Şahinbey Indoor Sports Hall and finally at Şehitkamil TÜRGEV ​​Hatice Hatun Dormitory. We were with our businessmen at the opening ceremony of TÜMSİAD's fair and SME Council on Friday. In the evening of the same day, a group of Alevi-Bektashi
We came together with opinion leaders at the Ashura iftar; We had our iftar and chatted. On Thursday, we met with our workers and laborers at the HAK-İŞ General Assembly, and then with our lawyers, judges, prosecutors and legal brothers here in this hall.
On Tuesday, we had meetings with opinion leaders from our Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia Regions. As you can see, we come together with our nation almost every day, we miss them, and we consult with them about the issues of the country and the nation.
Some people criticize our frequent meetings with our headmen and other segments of society, and they are disturbed by this. The President's meeting with mukhtars, civil servants, workers, businessmen, lawyers, people from all walks of life and all walks of life,
I ask; why are you bothered? What could be more natural than the President, who came to this office directly with the vote of the nation, to meet with the people at every opportunity?
Now let me give you another news that will upset them; As you know, on Thursday, October 29, we will celebrate the anniversary of Republic Day in this country again. In our country, Republic Days have generally been celebrated without the presence of the president.
It took place in the form of dry state ceremonies. We are hosting a reception here at noon on October 28, at the Presidential Complex, where only the people from our 81 provinces, that is, our nation and people, will attend.
We will host here 10 citizens from each of our 81 provinces who do not have any title or any official duty. Thus, we will start the tradition of celebrating Republic Day in the nation's home, with the nation. This will be a first. Hopefully
This number will increase even more when we build our new place or something. We will hold our usual ceremonies again on October 29th.
This year, we made radical changes in the October 29 ceremonies. We are taking these ceremonies out of their forbidden format and transforming them into a structure that expresses our country's history, culture, the achievements of our Republic, and our 2023 goals.
Hopefully, Republic Days themselves will now have a form and spirit that is integrated with our nation and reflects our nation's past, present and future.
Today, Ashura is being distributed in 14 provinces in 7 regions of our country, that is, in front of mosques after the noon prayer, on behalf of myself, on behalf of the Presidency, with the participation of the Presidential Secretary General, deputy Secretary Generals and unit heads.
This is currently continuing in 14 provinces. In short, the President and the Presidency continue to meet with the people at every opportunity and will continue to do so.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Those who criticize us are the biggest republicans, the biggest nationalists, the biggest nationalists when it comes to words. Well, we need to ask them; What have you done so far for the Republic and the people? When we ask this, they have no answer.
Because they do not have a single planted tree or any work of art in this country. They only talk, they only insult, they are always around, they are always on newspaper pages, screens and podiums. They always seem to be doing something,
but it is not clear what they are used for, such as 'idler pulley'.
My brothers,
A headman is a responsible person who has a strong bond with the nation and his neighborhood, and who comes to that position with the aim of serving the people of the neighborhood, right? Not only are they of no use to the country and nation, but they also have no tolerance for democracy. Just like peace from their mouths
Just like those who don't stop talking and try to drown the country in violence and blood, they always say democracy, but they are the leading fascists. They cannot tolerate any opinion other than their own. They do not value any words other than their own. own life
They do not tolerate or respect any other way of life other than their own. However, democracy is a management approach that encourages pluralism, where everyone can express their own opinion and defend their own thoughts. They don't think the way they want, they don't
Aren't they the ones who attack the nation, insult the nation, and call them 'canister heads' because they don't behave the way they want? Aren't they the ones who call him stupid and say 'the man who scratches his belly'? Their paths will never cross paths with democracy.
Their hostility towards us stems from the fact that we express our nation, their feelings, and that we govern the country together with our nation, and they are disturbed by this. Because they have been seeking the consent of the nation for years without taking a mandate from the nation.
They are used to ruling this country as if it were their father's property, without any regard for it. For years, they have been used to imposing their ideologies, which are incompatible with the spirit and ferment of these lands, on the nation by using all public resources. In any political, social, cultural or economic field,
They do not consent to anyone else's existence. They want Tayyip Erdoğan not to interfere now, leave the square to us, and let us continue in the same way. Tayyip Erdoğan is doing his own job, you should do yours too. Opposition parties also want this, PKK
This is what the parallel structure wants, too. Those so-called intellectuals who publish declarations and complain about their country to the West also want this. They are not enlightened, they are dark. Along with them, those countries and their secret and open rulers that you know very well are doing the same thing.
wants. Come on, we understand what's going on outside, but the situation of the mankurts inside really upsets us. Those who surrender their will and resources to other hands, even though they earn the bread of this country, this nation, this state, are in a truly pitiful situation.
Of course, we also know that the fight of this group, which is so alienated from its own country, its own society, its own history, culture and civilization, and even so hostile, is not with us, but with the nation itself. This is what they cannot tolerate
It is not me personally who is in the office, but the nation itself. I am mortal, I exist today, I may not exist tomorrow. The real problem of those who complain that Turkey is polarized is that this country is not handed over to them with everything it used to be.
National will is the determining factor, they are very disturbed by this.
Those who have become so miserable that they seek help from the actions of a terrorist organization or a terrorist organization and complain about their own country to foreigners should know this: There is a nation at the other end of this incident. When they say 'there should be no polarisation', they say 'the national will is in vain'.
They say, 'Give it over, hand over the country to us.'
Dear brothers and sisters,
The old situation is obsolete... Those times are now behind us. Gone are the days when you despised this nation because of its beliefs, culture, dress, accent and tradition, and when you did not value it beyond seeing yourself as a servant. Now
This state, with all its institutions and all its possibilities, is at the disposal of the nation; They will know this once and for all. 'First the state, then the people; no, that's left behind. 'People first, then the state'; This is the time now.
The only duty of both us who are elected and the public officials who are appointed is to serve this nation. I'm saying it, I'm saying it openly, who is currently appointed or elected? Elected to office; Know this once and for all.
That's why those who are in office by appointment will be respectful to those who are in office by election, because they are the representatives of the nation, this is how we will know.
What do our elders say about this? Keep people alive so that the state can live. If we cannot provide our nation with more freedom, more prosperity and a happier life, it means we are occupying these seats. Whether it is president, prime minister or minister,
Whether he is a mayor or a bureaucrat; Everyone who works in state administration should ask themselves, ""What did I do for my nation today?"" when they lay their heads on the pillow in the evening. If he cannot find a way out to answer this question, that day is lost.
It's a day, a day wasted. I pray that God keeps us away from being among such heedless people. Because we believe in the words of our Prophet, ""The one whose two days are equal, the one whose days are equal, is at a loss."" Therefore, he should organize his life accordingly.
We are the necessary people. Every day we will add something new to the previous day so that we can continue the development, development and growth of our country.
Thank God, we have served our nation with this understanding for 13 years, we have grown Turkey threefold and improved our economy and democracy, and we have come to this day. Hopefully, we will continue on our way with the same understanding and achieve the 2023 goals, and realize our 2053 and 2071 vision.
We will pass. We have big dreams, big goals, big projects for Turkey, for our nation, and hopefully we will start all of these one by one and bring them to fruition, because we have a promise to our nation. We follow this path for rank, for position,
We did not come out for this or that reason, those who came out like this lost their way after a while and walked towards their own fate. Our cause is to serve God and the people. That's why we say what Pir Sultan Abdal says: “Put me in.”
I am for the sake of truth / Let those who turn back, let them turn back, I will not turn back from my way / Shall I turn back from my way and be deprived of it / Let those who turn back, turn back, I will not turn back from my way.” My dear brothers and sisters, we will not turn back from our path.
In this regard, the November 1 elections are of vital importance. Turkey should continue on its way by re-establishing the atmosphere of stability and trust that was endangered on June 7, more strongly, on November 1. As much as our businessmen need this, our workers and all
Our people need it just as much. My brother in Diyarbakır and Hakkari needs this as much as my brother in Istanbul and Yozgat needs this. You saw what they did to the hospital in Hakkari Şemdinli just yesterday, right? police station,
You saw what they did to the surrounding schools, right? We built an airport in Hakkari, Saladin Eyyubi Airport. They scanned the terminal building the other day.
Dear brothers and sisters,
I am asking, I am calling out to all the people of the region, I am also calling out to my Kurdish brothers; Those who talk about peace when they come to the west, I wonder if those who bombed this hospital in Şemdinli, these police stations, these schools, these mosques, this airport?
isn't it? On the one hand, you will say peace, and on the other hand, you will create terror everywhere with the PKK terrorist organization that you rely on.
I am calling out, I am calling out to all the people of the region and my entire nation; My brothers and sisters, if you will not teach the necessary lesson on November 1st to those who rely on this terrorist organization, when will you? This is what being a nation requires.
My brothers, we need to know this very well: There is a fact, since the first day I took office, I mean my Prime Ministry, we have built 2500 hospitals, health homes, day hospitals, etc. so far. Look, an NGO working on these issues
While terrorist organizations were carrying out these actions in these hospitals, they did not wake up one day and curse the terrorist organization. The condition of these hospitals before was obvious; they had neither a hygienic structure nor did they resemble a proper hospital. We built modern hospitals for you,
We built hospitals with rooms for 2 people and their attendants, with toilets and bathrooms. In Hakkari, I opened two hospitals on the same day, each with 150 beds... The terrorist organization and the political party it supports threatened that no one would come there. someone
I opened one in Yüksekova and one in Hakkari centre.
Even though all the facts are obvious, these people still say peace... It is very clear what you understand by peace; You understand peace as blood, blood...
And that day, I experienced two events. A female doctor came to me and said, 'Dear Prime Minister, we are under constant threat, you have built a very modern hospital, but please do not condemn us to stay in houses in the city, because we are afraid to go home. To us
If you build lodgings there, we will provide much more comfortable service.' I returned, gave instructions, and we built lodgings there immediately. Likewise, I came to the opening of the hospital in the city, a pregnant sister of mine, a police officer's wife, came to me and said, 'My Prime Minister, you are not going to harass me tonight.'
They did it, my master was on duty, they raided our house and, unfortunately, they kicked, slapped and harassed me in this state. 'Please provide us with a lodging,' he said.
Dear brothers and sisters,
With what face are they talking about peace? They get votes in this country with threats. The OSCE representatives that the West sent here, etc., they do not see these. They see, but they ignore, and without getting bored, they write their reports as if every time
They give it as if the thing is fine.
No matter what they do, we will not determine our route according to their words, we will determine it according to the wisdom of our nation. Just as much as our retirees need the strengthening of the environment of stability and trust, our workers, students and housewives need
And it needs that much, because we are Turkey all together. For this reason, we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers and we will be Turkey.
In this regard, our headmen have important duties. We need to work hard together in order for Turkey to regain a strong climate of stability and trust. You are the determining power in this country, 50 thousand headmen, my brothers, are the greatest power. And you
You came with the will of the people, you are the one whom the people know first and foremost, and you are the one who knows best who is and who is not in that neighbourhood, that street, that village, whatever. The whole point is your acumen, your will, you have to show it fully.
You need to explain these facts to every brother in your neighborhood, and if there are those who are hesitant, you need to convince them, because we are all a nation together. This flag is for all of us, this country is for all of us, this state is for all of us, just as our past is one, our future is also one.
Dear brothers and sisters, we cannot allow even the slightest weakness, the slightest discouragement, fatigue or regression in this matter.
We see the events happening around us. You know what Afghanistan has been through since 1979 and Iraq since 1990. Look, the former Prime Minister of England said, ""We are responsible for the events in Iraq, I apologize."" This is very interesting and this man
He is the head of the Quartet and now he is saying this. But of course it was too late, the one who took the horse passed Üsküdar, Iraq collapsed, now it cannot get back on its feet. The same goes for Syria, 370 thousand people were killed in Syria, where is the West? Here is from Iraq and Syria, 2
We host 1 million 200 thousand Syrians and 300 thousand Iraqis in our country, right? What is the West doing? The West was watching, closed its doors, and said to us: 'You are very successful, you are really making great efforts, we need to help you too.'
says. OK, where are you?
But of course, we grew up with the Ansar culture; We know the Muhajirin and the Ansar. Because we know him well, we opened our doors to our Syrian brothers who escaped from those bombs with our Ansar culture, we did not ask, ""Why are you coming?"" We opened our doors to those fleeing Iraq,
We didn't say, 'Why are you coming?' We did not ask which sect you are from, which race you are from, we opened the door to Arabs, Kurds, Christians and Muslims... We did not ask anyone, 'Why are you coming?' and we shared our vaccine with them. Clothing, care,
We did everything, including his treatment in hospitals. There is no example of this in the world right now.
They come and speak nice things to us, and when we leave, they say nice things to us. When we say 'Come on' they don't open their purse. But you see, let's say they give a neighbor a loan grant of 400 billion euros. Come on, look, we've only been in the camps so far.
We spent 8 billion dollars on these. Today, there are 500 thousand Syrians in Istanbul alone. I'm only talking about Istanbul, I'm not talking about other provinces. It is the State and government of the Republic of Türkiye that is enduring all this. But unfortunately, those who criticize even this have lost their way
There are politicians who have lost, there are darkness that seem bright. Why did we get involved in Syria? Our foreign policy was wrong. What would happen? Just like the West, were we going to wait for their death or stand by?
The same thing could happen to us tomorrow. Some people are trying to drag Turkey into the same chaos and turmoil. Unfortunately, some of us also support this. This is why the daggers that the centers of tutelage have stuck in the hearts of the nation for years.
This was behind the processes that led Turkey to coups, they executed Menderes for this. This is why they oppressed Özal so much. Sultan II. They declared Abdülhamit Khan a dictator, and then they dealt with him. 33 years without losing a single bit of this land
This is how they dealt with this Sultan who ruled. They have created obstacles for us in every step we have taken for the past 13 years. They also called me a 'dictator'. Behind the Gezi events, the December 17-25 coup attempt and the recent resurgence of separatist terrorism
There was always the same goal. Look, the so-called parallel state structure - as I describe it in recent days; The parallel state structure, whose base is worship, whose middle is trade, and whose ceiling is treason - they are currently acting together with the separatist terrorist organization. In this respect
Their eyes are so filled with greed that their despicableness knows no bounds.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Despite all this, no matter what they do, we see who said what, who took what attitude, how they acted in this historical period, and we record the collective conscience. My brothers, when the time, hour and day come, everyone will change their stance against terrorism.
He will give an account to both conscience, law and history, there is no escape from this account. Even if you escape in this world, there is no escape in the eternal world.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Our citizens in the provinces we visited and our brothers and sisters with whom we came together here rightly ask us: 'What will be the end of this terrorism?' I am clearly repeating the answer I gave to all of them to my muhtar brothers here today. First of all, Turkey's
The problem it faces today is not a problem of ethnic or sectarian origin. Our problem is the problem of terrorism, and it is undoubtedly my Kurdish brothers in the region who are most exposed to the oppression of the terrorist organization, who lose the most lives, and who suffer the most. The solution lies in solving the problem of terrorism
is passing. But now I say; My Kurdish brothers in the region should also take a stand against this terrorist organization. If we are going to die, let's die once, but let's die like a man, this should be done.
Is there anyone in the region who supports the terrorist organization? Unfortunately there is. Aren't there people hiding these terrorists in their homes? There are, but their numbers are very few. Moreover, there are people from all ethnic backgrounds among the terrorist organization's members and supporters.
domestic and international. Therefore, nothing could be more wrong than identifying the terrorist organization with the people of the region. On the contrary, the people of the region have shown with their dignified attitude during this process that their preference is for unity, solidarity and a common future.
The biggest gain for our country from these recent events is that this will to live together has emerged once again and strongly. Therefore, our job will be easier from now on, with God's permission.
What we need to do now is to continue our principled stance against terrorism in a determined and astute manner. What do we say? Until the terrorist organization lays down all its weapons, until it is not enough to leave it, until it buries it in the ground and pours concrete over it, it will force all its members out of our territory.
This struggle will continue until we remove it.
My brothers,
No one should expect complacency from us, no one should expect us to take a break from this, absolutely. The target is not just on November 1st, you know that. These operations will continue until and after November 1, and we will continue against all terrorist organizations.
will. Here's our operations against the DAESH terrorist organization this morning in Diyarbakir... For us, PKK is different, DAESH is different, DHKP-C is different, YPG is different, PYD is not different, they are all the same. They also carried out the terrorist attack in front of the station jointly.
Know this as well. But you understand why the political party that supports the terrorist organization says 'murderer state' at the very first moment, right? This is a political party that is supposedly in Parliament. What is he saying? ""The state did this, the murderer state,"" he says. 'This Palace
He says 'he did it' and tries to foot the bill here. Why? Yavuz the thief would subdue the landlord; These are vicious thieves.
We also say; We will all join hands, and with God's permission, the state will never give credit to their slanders. They will pay a heavy price for these, and they are already paying. So far, we are continuing all our operations, regardless of mountain or stone.
Our urban operations continue. Of course, don't we have sadness? There is. Our martyrs are our sadness. But when I call all the families of our martyrs, I say this to them: Your son, your brother, your master, who has the highest position after the prophets,
You too will be proud of them.
My brothers,
Let's not forget this: Martyrdom is not a temporary event. We are Muslims, I do not speak for non-Muslims, I speak for Muslims. What does our Lord say when revealing the verses about martyrs in our book, the Holy Quran? ""Those who were killed in the way of Allah
Don't say they are dead. They are alive, but you do not understand, you do not know.” Well, since it is there in this way, what will it be like to drink the sherbet of martyrdom for this cause, this position until the end of time? It will continue. My brothers, that is why this position, which is not granted to everyone,
Of course, with God's permission, it will upset those who are fortunate enough to do so for a while, but I believe that they will live with that honor and this state is their servant. And we mobilized all our means for the families of our martyrs during our rule, and we continue to do so.
We will do so from now on.
My brothers, I ask my brothers in the region to protect their children, who were deceived by lies, various promises, and sent to their deaths in plain sight, and whose futures were darkened. I want them to protect their children who go to the mountains. They should be careful, local people
Not a single child of those who sent their children to death is there. Those who establish a plundering scheme in the region on behalf of the terrorist organization and collect profit from it, go at the first opportunity and live a life for themselves in the west of our country or even in Europe. your children
They educate people there, they train them there. But my Kurdish brother continues to live in his house in his village, district and neighborhood. Because he has nowhere to go. None of us, my dear brothers, have anywhere to go but this homeland, we
we know this. That's why we have to embrace our country with all our hands. Turkey is a country big enough for all of us, safe for all of us, and strong enough to establish a prosperous future for all of us. The people of none of the artificial states established in the region have been at peace for 100 years.
couldn't get together. However, we have reached the 92nd anniversary of our Republic, and despite all its shortcomings and setbacks, we have reached these days by preserving our independence and maintaining our confidence in our future.
My brothers,
Thanks to the progress we have made in economy and democracy in the past 13 years, we have largely compensated for the mistakes and shortcomings of the past and have come to a position where we are more hopeful for our future. As a country, as a nation, we will continue to achieve these achievements to the fullest.
We will protect it. Nearly 260 thousand classrooms were built in this country. Currently, there are universities in all 81 provinces. When we took office, there were 76 universities, now there are 193 universities.
Dear brothers and sisters,
There is no province left where we do not have a hospital, and we have spread to districts even with health centers. Remember, we could get prescriptions from hospitals, but we couldn't find the medicine. We were able to go to any pharmacy we wanted and buy our medicine. And we have decent ambulances
did not have. Now, regardless of mountain or stone, snow or winter, we climb there with pallet ambulances. We have helicopter ambulances, we have jet ambulances. Why? Maybe patients need to be taken from one end of Turkey to the other; He immediately gets a jet ambulance for him.
It takes him all the way to the other end.
Dear brothers and sisters,
We had 26 airports, but now we have 55 airports. Now we have an airport in Ağrı, we have an airport in Iğdır, we have an airport in Muş, we have an airport in Şırnak, we have an airport in Hakkari, we have an airport in Kars. But what do they say?
We need something else, not an airport. What do you need? 'We will vote for ourselves,' he says. What does it mean to vote for yourself? My brothers, a religion called the 'religion of racism' has now emerged. Do we have a religion called racism? No. We, Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Laz,
We are one nation, with 78 million Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Roma and Bosnians.
We have one flag, do we have a second flag? But unfortunately, those who travel with the second flag can get votes in this country. Shouldn't we give them the necessary answer on November 1? Here we see the coffins they carry, they put their own rags on the coffins.
Unfortunately, they organize burial ceremonies by going around. After that, they say without shame or boredom: 'We have no problem with the flag.' I don't know if you have a problem with the flag, but I know you have a problem with the Turkish Flag.
You are the one who burned my flag during the Gezi events, you are the one who took down our flag from the pole. You never made or could make a defense contrary to these. You did this for show in the squares from time to time, but you couldn't always do it. You are our national anthem
You even stood in front of him. Because you have never been a nation, you have never been a nation, you have never been a single flag, you have never been a single country, you have never been a single country and you have been in favor of discrimination. And you stood up for yourself and said, 'We will also build our own homeland.' These
We have all the documents. Who are you telling this to?
And the fourth is one state. My dear brothers and sisters, we do not recognize any other state other than the Republic of Turkey in the 780 thousand square kilometer homeland of the Republic of Turkey, there is no such thing. Our people living in the region with their own beliefs, culture,
We expect him to take a stand against the organization and the structures under its control, which have nothing to do with its history and act for purely ideological purposes, and to show this as soon as possible. My brothers, the problem for us is that when we reach this goal, the terrorist organization
It will be over, God willing, when we reduce its activities to zero level and ensure that all discussions and struggles are carried out in the political arena.
We will meet with you soon and have our meal. My request from you is this: As the headman, my dear brothers and sisters, in the neighborhood or village you are in, make sure that all our citizens go to the polls, because the vote is our honor, the vote is ours.
It is our honor. Let's protect this honor, this honor, in a very, very different way on November 1.
Once again, I would like to thank each and every one of you for visiting the Presidential Complex, the house of the nation. After the meal, we will take our pictures together, share our gift with you, and then we will take you back to your cities.
We will send you off.
For now, I greet you with love and respect.

",2023-11-01,The AK Party became the sole government again with 317 deputies.,before
Their Speech at the 12th Mukhtars' Meeting,2015-10-19,"

Our dear headmen,
My dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings.
At the very beginning of my words, I commemorate Alija Izetbegovic, the first President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a great statesman and intellectual, a wise leader, with mercy and longing on his 12th death anniversary.
Welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation. We are with you for the 12th of our Mukhtars Meeting, which we have been holding for about 10 months. Today, from our provinces Balıkesir, Bursa, Edirne, Erzurum, Gümüşhane, Istanbul, Kocaeli, Malatya, Sakarya and Mersin.
We welcome you, our esteemed headmen.
We aim to come together with all the headmen in our country in this way and relieve their longing. As the first President of Turkey elected directly by the vote of the nation, we have a very good relationship with our headmen, who came to power with the votes of the people of the neighborhood.
I believe we understand. You, as the headman of your neighborhood and village, and I, as a kind of headman of Turkey, strive to embrace and serve our nation, from every single individual to all 78 million people.
Remember, when I was sentenced to prison for a poem I read in 1998, the newspapers at that time wrote a headline like this: ""He can't even be a headman."" That was their headline. The purpose of this headline was to insult the national will, the nation's choice, the people's vote.
It was to humiliate, to denigrate.
Because, in principle, there is no difference between being elected as a headman and being elected as a mayor, a member of parliament, a prime minister, or, since last year, a president. In all of them, you will appear before the nation and explain your vision, projects and values.
and you will want votes. If the nation believes, trusts and trusts your attitude and your words, they will choose you and you will come to power.
Those who have governed the country for many years, not according to the will of the nation, but through its media, business associations, bureaucracy, and a tutelage system they have established, can never tolerate this. The most suitable place for this segment is not the headman's neighborhood.
It is the headman who serves them. Likewise, for them, the most acceptable mayor, the most acceptable member of parliament, the most acceptable minister, prime minister and president are those who are at their disposal, not the nation's.
Since we were the Mayor in 1994 under the command of the people of Istanbul, not these tutelage centers, we were exposed to that headline at that time. Likewise, the reason for the criticism and insults directed at us so far is; Prime Minister and President
As a company, we serve under the command of the nation, not under them. They are disturbed by the fact that you, not them, are here, and that your voice, not theirs, is being heard.
Believe me, this is the real reason behind the criticisms about the Presidential Complex. Otherwise, they know as well as we do that there is no legal, political or moral problem with this social complex. Their only problem is that Beştepe
is that they are under the command of the nation, not themselves. Let them shout as much as they want, slander as much as they want, work as much as they want; Beştepe will continue to be at the disposal of the nation.
Dear brothers and sisters,
They got it both ways; 'illegal palace, illegal palace...' Do you have a document or an information in your hand? If there is, come and explain it and say, 'here you are, illegal palace'. Even though we repeatedly explain all the decisions of the Council of State, they continue to insist on this. Why? Slander
If the horse doesn't catch, it leaves a mark. These are slanderers. Recently, the leader of another opposition party said in a television program: -The Chairman of the Main Opposition had said these before; But he realized that this did not work, this time he decided to say 'I will come if they call me'.
started. First he said, 'I will not go to an illegal palace.' - He said, 'Turkey is governed from an illegal palace'; Similar expressions are used.
Dear brothers and sisters,
These people need to learn that being a politician in this country requires being honest first. If a politician is not honest, he cannot be respected by the nation. First, we need to give examples of this in the best possible way. Because this is not my place, this is the place of the people.
the House. As a complex, I serve here today, and others will serve here tomorrow. But the point is to bring such a work to my country and to present a different image to the world with this work. This work shows the greatness of this nation,
It shows the honor of this nation.
Dear brothers and sisters,
As His Holiness Ibrahim Hakkı from Erzurum said: ""The evils of truth are good things / Those who watch the moment of wisdom / Do not think that they do things that are not good / Let's see what God does, whatever they do is good."" My brothers; We went through this in defiance of those who wanted to darken Turkey's agenda with terrorism, blood and grudges.
We have witnessed very beautiful and beneficial developments together as a country and as a nation this week.
In the past weeks, I received the news in Japan that Professor Aziz Sancar, a scientist born in our country, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. I called him personally and shared this joy with him. Last week, our National Team played against Iceland.
As a nation, we all experienced the joy of gaining the right to directly participate in Euro-2016 due to its victory and the results achieved by other teams. Sumitomo Rubber Factory, an investment of 516 million dollars in Çankırı, was opened on Wednesday.
We held the opening ceremony. On Friday, at the Women-20 Summit held in Istanbul as part of the preparations for the G-20 Summit to be held in Antalya next month, women from all over the world discussed the economy, working life, employment and terrorism.
we talked. We all experienced the excitement of the successful launch of the Türksat 4B Satellite from Kazakhstan on Friday night.
We personally witnessed another dream come true with the ceremonies held in both Mersin and Cyprus on Saturday. Inauguration of the project that brings drinking and agricultural irrigation water to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus through a 107-kilometer pipeline from Anamur.
we made it happen. This project, which transfers the water collected in the Alaköprü Dam in Anamur to the Geçitköy Dam in Northern Cyprus through pipes under the Mediterranean Sea and distributes it to the island from there, is an investment of 1 billion 600 million lira. Now to stain it, to shade it
They started saying this. They said; 'Water has gone to Northern Cyprus before.'
Dear friends,
They took water with the right balloon, then that balloon burst and remained that way. But they said, 'Today water will come here with a balloon, tomorrow with a pipe.' Of course, they also knew that this would not happen with that balloon. Of course, now he will say tu-kaka, to say this, 'from where and how?
'Let me get closer and say this', they say. Be realistic, the mill won't turn with carrying water. They thought they could turn the mill with water, but it didn't and the balloon burst.
I did the same thing when I became the Mayor of Istanbul, Istanbul was thirsty at that time too. Those of you who remember know, especially my brothers from Istanbul; As you know, they wanted to bring water to Istanbul by ship or tanker. But the water brought only reached Kuruçeşme.
It was enough, just enough for Beşiktaş. But what were they saying? 'Look, we brought it.' Is this possible? What did we do? We brought water to Istanbul from 180 kilometers, drilled the mountains and then met Istanbul's water needs. Then the islands were thirsty, 5 islands were called
We once took water from under the sea. At that time, a Northern Cypriot Minister said, 'Can't you bring us water from under the sea?' I said to them; 'It will happen when the time comes.' And the time has come, my dear brothers, we laid the foundation on March 7, 2011 and now
We opened it in Istanbul and now water has started to be supplied to Northern Cyprus from under the sea. We did not stop there, we said, 'If Southern Cyprus is ready for peace, we will give this peace water to Southern Cyprus as a result of these negotiations.' We said we could. Because this nation
As a Turkish nation, it always does whatever suits its reputation. As long as those who are against us show us the necessary respect at this point.
We had very productive meetings with the President of Finland, Mr. Niinistö, who paid an official visit to our country here on Tuesday, and with the German Chancellor, Mrs. Merkel, who came to Istanbul for a working visit yesterday. During these visits, we have bilateral meetings with our interlocutors.
In addition to our relations, we held very important meetings regarding Turkey's membership in the European Union and the refugee issue, which is a growing problem.
And this morning, together with the Prime Minister, we witnessed the loan agreement for infrastructure financing of 4.6 billion euros signed between the companies carrying out the construction of the new airport in Istanbul and 6 banks.
Of course, I would especially like to point out that we cannot fully experience the happiness of these services, which we believe are very beneficial for the future of our country and nation, under the shadow of terrorist incidents. And no one follows this service policy, my dear brothers and sisters,
cannot evaluate. That's why our headmen have a lot of work to do. Will we give importance to service politics or terrorism? Whatever we will do, we will bring terrorism to its knees with God's permission, do not worry about that.
Of course, our martyrs are our bleeding wound, but know that martyrs lie behind the victory of a nation. Martyrs always lie beneath the future of a nation. That's why, in our National Anthem, ""Şüheda will gush out, if you squeeze the ground, Şüheda / Her life,
It is said, ""Let God take away my soul and all that I have. / Don't leave me alone in the world from my only homeland."" Alhamdulillah, this country was kneaded with the blood of martyrs and came to this state. That's why we can't put it aside. But we also know this: Our martyrs are alive, not dead, and are prophets.
It is the highest rank after his rank.
My dear brothers and sisters;
The pain of the citizens we lost in the bomb attack in front of Ankara Train Station the previous weekend hurts us with all its freshness. In addition, many of our soldiers and police were martyred in terrorist attacks that continued during the week and at the weekend.
we gave. Two of our police officers were martyred in Van on Wednesday, in Şırnak on Friday, a lieutenant colonel, a first lieutenant and two petty officers were martyred in Dağlıca on Saturday, and two soldiers were martyred in Tunceli on Sunday.
In fact, we know that the aim of terrorism is to distract Turkey from this agenda, from investments, services and projects. For this reason, while we are in an uninterrupted fight against terrorism, on the other hand, the future of our country and our nation is at stake.
We follow our vital investments and projects with precision. We know that if we abandon these works, which are essential and necessary for the future of the country and the nation, then we will torment the souls of our martyrs. for him
We will not stop, we will not give up for that reason. We will both fight against terrorism and work for Turkey's development, growth and strengthening.
My brothers;
Thank God, we have the power, perseverance and determination to carry out both struggles together and achieve success together. Today, I would like to thank the internal and external circles who work with all their strength for those who aim to take Turkey off its course and who are walking towards that goal.
I'm calling out. As you know, today is also Mukhtar's Day; I am calling out on this Mukhtar's Day. I say to them; You will not succeed, you will not be able to destroy our brotherhood, you will not be able to lower our flag, you will not be able to silence our call to prayer, you will not be able to take us away from our 2023 goals.
You won't be able to give up. You will not be able to distract us from our visions of 2053 and 2071. I hope you will fall into the traps you set for us. You will not be able to make us pariahs in our 1000-year-old homeland.
We will protect our independence and future together until the end. We will never lose hope. Because, according to our belief, hopelessness is a sign of blasphemy. As Master Necip Fazıl said, 'Tomorrow is definitely ours, it is definitely ours. The sun has risen, the sun has set
It is ours forever.'
My dear brothers and sisters; Opposition and criticism are indispensable elements in democracies. We know that opposition and criticism are not exclusive to political parties, but also intellectuals and academics have this right. As a matter of fact, in the multi-party period in our country
There has always been an opposition to every government, both politically and socially.
But there is a very important distinction, a sensitive point that everyone should pay attention to; No opposition has the right to be against its own country, its own society, or even to be hostile. While saying this, the ruling party or any party, any
I am not talking about criticizing the views and actions of an institution or expressing opinions about them. I have already stated that this is everyone's natural right. The point I draw attention to here is; degree of hostility towards his own country and his own society
It is an understanding of opposition.
In our country, in order to criticize the government and state institutions, we support terrorist organizations, political organizations under the control of separatist organizations - look, I don't even have the language to call it a party, that's why I call it an organization - under the name of opposition.
There are those who try to legitimize it. Some media organizations, some academics and some politicians have left their jobs and turned into propaganda machines of the terrorist organization and the political organization under its control. This has nothing to do with democracy.
There is no.
There is no such shield of democracy anywhere in the world for those who work against their own country and nation. From time to time, when I say 'Turkey is the most democratic country in the world', there are people who take this with sarcasm and get disturbed.
Now I'm asking them from here, but let them put their hands on their conscience and answer accordingly. To this question, they can give examples from Europe, America or any other place they consider democratic. In any country governed by democracy, there are tens of thousands of people like the PKK.
Is it possible to openly support a terrorist organization that kills people and the organizations under its control, as we do?
Look at Spain, look at England, look at America, is it possible? Can such a situation be allowed? Likewise, can a terrorist organization like DHKP-C and the politicians who support it be shown the slightest tolerance? Again, where in the world is ISIS?
How can a state or a government that is fighting against such a dangerous organization be left alone and tried to wear it down? There is no such example, this is not democracy. This is called terrorism supporter, supporter of a terrorist organization.
German Chancellor is coming to Turkey; A group of people calling themselves academics came out and after a lot of false and wrong reasons; He says, 'Don't come, this visit means support for Erdoğan and Davutoğlu.' The name of this initiative is the 5th Column activity. of this initiative
I see those in it as 'mankurts'. What is even sadder is that a significant portion of this group is working at public universities, therefore receiving salaries from the state, and living prosperously with the opportunities provided to them by the nation.
In their declaration, they claim that Turkey has become an uninhabitable country for them. There is a beautiful saying by the late Cemil Meriç, the Master says: “Those who find this country uninhabitable are the ones who make this country uninhabitable.
These people, pay attention, speak every day on television, in newspapers and on podiums, but they cannot find any response in the nation. After that, he hates his own country and society, saying 'this nation does not understand us'. Not of his own country and nation
Our nation already knew those who sided with terrorist organizations, terrorists, and shadowy organizations of foreign countries. He recognizes it once again on such occasions and records it in his memory.
Whenever Turkey comes to a crossroads, the choice of this group is not in favor of a national and local stance; On the contrary, it has been destructive, divisive, and has sided with the side that is against us. A bridge is wanted to be built across the Bosphorus, and these are erected across it. A dam is wanted to be built across it.
These are sewn. An airport is wanted to be built, these are erected in front of it. A foreign policy in line with our history, culture and civilizational values ​​is pursued on the side of the victim and the oppressed, and they stand against them. Their biggest supporter is by convincing the nation
These are some parties that cannot achieve their goals. Those who cannot gain political power by gaining the support of the nation try to corner the Government through terrorism and terrorist organizations through these so-called academics who are alienated from their own people.
We follow with sadness.
These so-called politicians, intellectuals, media members, and representatives of civil society, who have lost their minds and conscience to the extent of pointing out that we are responsible for terrorism, terrorist incidents, and bombings, should know this well: I voted for my person as President with 52 percent of the votes.
My responsibilities towards my nation, which brought me to this position, come before anything else for me. I will continue to do whatever I have to do regarding the integrity of our country, the unity of our nation, and the survival of our state. Acting in this way violates not only the Constitution but also
It is also a requirement of my responsibility towards our nation and history.

Brothers and sisters, we are mortal. Neither these positions nor these places will remain ours. If we want to leave a stronger, more prosperous and more peaceful Turkey to our children and the generations after us, we have to take these risks and make these sacrifices today.
Thank God, my nation has already deemed me worthy of every position. He made him the Metropolitan Mayor of Istanbul, he made him the Prime Minister, and finally he deemed him worthy of this place and made him the President. What else will I be after?

My struggle is the struggle for the future of my country and my nation. Be sure of this: If I were a President who did not interfere in any business, sat in his corner, and appeared in public only when necessary, believe me, these would not come under any criticism.
And I never get a headache. But then I wouldn't have the face to face my nation. ""Why did you come to this position?"" they ask. What did I say and promise when I was elected president? I said; 'I will be a president who works, runs and sweats,
'I will not be a conventional president.' Moreover, I did not come to this position by chance. I was the Prime Minister of this country for 11.5 years, are our works visible? Alhamdulillah, we are present in 81 of 81 provinces with our works. There is no province or district where we do not have works.
no; We worked like this.
There are projects and services that are under construction and in the implementation phase, we have to follow them. There are projects and services in preparation; We have to follow them and ensure that they come to life. There are many projects we promised for 2023,
I need to follow them. How can I sit in my corner when Türkiye is under attack by the terrorist organization? While the eyes and hands of the whole world are on Syria, how can I follow the developments from afar? I feel like our peace, our prosperity and our future are being threatened.
How can I keep him busy with other things? If I try to act like this, I won't be able to stand up against my nation.

Those who do not hesitate to endanger the future of 78 million people for their own interests cannot tolerate this stance, this understanding of ours. They want the President to step down and let us govern Turkey as before. It's been 13 years, still
They did not give up on this love. No one should be sorry; As long as God gives life and our people support us, no one in this country who does not draw their power from the national will will be able to move their horses or blow their horns.

My brothers,
Now, I would like to remind you that we will all say this to them: Do you want to rule Turkey? There's the ballot box. Go in front of the nation and explain your problem. If you get the authority on November 1, then come to us. I say it everytime,
I express it once again here; What matters to us is the choice of our nation. Respecting that choice is a requirement of the values ​​we have defended so far and the position we hold. No one should have any doubts about this.

But the power he could not get from the nation; We will never allow anyone who tries to achieve this by using terrorism, terrorist organizations or other states. These men say this - there is no such thing as decency or modesty among them - what do they say: 'It seems that the ruling party will not fall below 40 percent,
Therefore, it is necessary to apply different methods to them.' Who are they? Darkness pretending to be enlightened.

My dear brothers and sisters;
They write these in their columns. And from time to time, they are in contact with Kandil, they go to Kandil and commiserate there. Then they write a book and try to gain something from that book. These people are called 'intellectuals' in this country.
They also get by. This is the requirement of being a democratic state of law, that is, the Constitution. We will make whatever the Constitution requires prevail in this country.

My dear brothers and sisters;
Once again, I would like to thank each and every one of you for visiting the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation. I ask you to convey my greetings, respect and affection to each of my brothers in your neighborhoods and villages.

With any luck, as you know, Türkiye will hold elections again on November 1. As you know, this re-election should bring stability and trust in this country. If this stability, this trust is achieved, I believe that Turkey will be able to achieve this upward trend it has achieved in the last 13 years.
will continue as is. I say may our unity and solidarity be eternal. And hopefully, we have to be one nation, one flag, one country, one state, and we will walk on this path like this. That's why we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, brothers
We will be, we will be Türkiye all together.

We'll be together again for dinner soon. Stay healthy.

4. International Students' Speech at the Graduation Ceremony,2015-06-11,"



Dear Guests,
Dear Members of the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities,
Dear Students,
Ladies and Gentlemen;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, love and respect. I congratulate all our students who will graduate from their schools in Turkey this year. Universities in Turkey with 4 thousand students who will graduate this year
The number of graduating international students reaches 60 thousand.
I just made a joke to Cemil and said, 'I thought I would see you the same as the day you came from Uganda, but today I saw you very differently.' I asked how many siblings you have, he said we are 7 siblings; 3 girls, 4 boys.
I express my gratitude to those who paved the way. We experience the honor of being a servant who contributes even a little to providing such a service in the country, and we are also happy for this. Because we are the grandchildren of such ancestors. And this legacy
We are loaded in this way, hopefully we will continue this way. When we consider the 70 thousand international students currently continuing their education, we see that Turkey has become an increasingly stronger brand in this field.
Of course, I do not agree with Mr. Kudret's statement that ""we cannot accept many more students"". Remember, zakat increases as you give alms. I see such services at the same point. Hopefully, the more we educate and give, the more blessings this will bring.
It increases with more.
If Turkey, which helped 45 million dollars to the least developed countries in the world 12 years ago, is helping 4.5 billion dollars today, the more it gave, the more it gave, the more it gave, it did not decrease, it came to a better place. I see it that way too.
I congratulate all my brothers and sisters who graduated from universities in Turkey and strive to serve their communities and countries in 160 different countries.
I wish success to my student brothers and young people who are still continuing their education. I would like to express this with all my sincerity to both graduates and students: We, as Turkey, will never forget you, and you too
Don't forget us. We will make every effort to keep the brotherhood relationship between us always strong. I see each of my brothers who return to their country after studying in Turkey as the honorary ambassador of this nation and this country there. Likewise here
I accept each of my student brothers and sisters who continue their education as honorary representatives of their country and society in Turkey.
I believe that this great interaction, which I believe is shaped around mutual love, respect, cooperation and a common vision of the future, will be beneficial for our countries and societies and will lead to auspicious results.
Dear friends,
The reality of globalization requires all societies, wherever they are in the world, to act together around common historical, cultural, economic, social and political values. Turkey's physical relations with Central Africa and South Asia
No matter how far they are, their fates are not separate from each other. Central Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, North Africa and the Caucasus are geographies with which we shared the same history and the same civilizational values ​​until yesterday. Our nation has been around for centuries
Although it has the largest and most powerful states in the world, it is perhaps the only society that has no shame of colonialism in its past. Today, the main axis of our foreign policy is the understanding of reaching out to a victim or an oppressed person anywhere in the world. In the Balkans in the past,
We act with the same understanding in Iraq, Syria and Palestine today, as we extended our help to our brothers there in the face of the troubles in the Caucasus. As a country and nation, we have never judged people based on the color of their skin, where they live, or how they speak.
We did not and do not differentiate based on language. Because we are a nation that says ""we love creation because of the Creator"" and believes this wholeheartedly. The biggest witnesses of this are the 60 thousand graduates spread over 160 countries, our brothers and sisters who receive service from our institutions operating in every corner of the world.
I believe it is.
Dear Guests,
Dear Students,
These lands, which host the world's oldest educational institutions, are trying to undertake the same mission again. In the past 12 years, our number of universities increased from 76 to 193, our student capacity reached 800 thousand, and our increasing housing capacity.
We have made an important move in this field with our scholarship opportunities.
One of the important steps we have taken in this context, as mentioned earlier, is the Turkey scholarships project. Scholarships given by different institutions with different statuses in the past, Turkey scholarships have been offered since 2012 during my Prime Ministry period.
gathered under the name With this project, which achieved great success in a short time, the work carried out with around 8 thousand applications, which was previously limited to 5-6 countries, has today reached 182 countries and 100 thousand applications.
Promotional activities carried out within the scope of Turkey scholarships enabled the number of students coming to our country with their own means to increase exponentially, thus, in 3 years, the number of international students in our country increased from 24 thousand to 15 thousand in Turkey.
reached 70 thousand, including scholarship holders. The students who were awarded Turkey scholarships were determined through interviews conducted in 100 different parts of the world, and it was ensured that the project carried out in accordance with its purpose.
There are really striking stories and anecdotes about students studying in our country within the scope of Turkey scholarships. The story of Ugandan Cemil, whose movie we just watched, was one of them. Türkiye
Cemil, who sees the advertisement hanging on the wall of the embassy building, applies online and returns to his village. We personally watched what kind of village it was and how it came from there to the embassy. This is not a dream, it is an actual situation. Whether your application has been accepted or not
Cemil, who walked from his village to the city hours away many times to read the e-mail about it, continues his education at Erciyes University today.
Another story: A student of ours who applied from Colombia, a village in Colombia, is eligible for an interview, but he cannot find travel money to go to the capital Bogota, where the interview will be held. The contribution of the villagers and our embassy
Our student, who was able to attend the interview with their help, is now studying in our country as a Turkish scholarship holder.
Another example is when the students from Indonesia who participated in the interview in the capital Jakarta were asked how their journey was, it turns out that all of them came from a distance of 3-4 days. As it is known, in many parts of Africa
The average lifespan is 45-50 years, but he finds this, so most of the students coming from these regions are orphans. Turkey scholarships are offered not only with the educational opportunities they provide, but also with the fact that they help orphans hold their hands.
is valuable.
We have many brothers and sisters in Turkey who completed their education with these scholarships and became ministers, senior managers, businessmen and academicians in their own countries. We occasionally encounter these brothers and sisters in the countries we visit.
and we are very happy. I experienced these myself.
I congratulate all my friends who contributed to the realization of these services. I have provided all kinds of support to my friends so far in maintaining these services in a way that befits our faith, history and culture.
I will continue to give from now on.
Dear Guests,
Turkey's strengthening, development and development means a new light of hope for our own citizens and all friendly and brotherly societies. Their geographies are rich not only with their natural riches, but also with their commercial and strategic
The understanding of evaluation with its importance caused great harm to humanity. Colonialism and slavery unfortunately continue their existence and effectiveness today, changing their shape but with the same logic. Food wasted in the West helps all the hungry in Africa
It is not possible to maintain an order in which the amount reaches a sufficient amount. While the fish taken from Lake Victoria in Central Africa are sent to Western countries in containers, a system is accepted in which even their bones are seen as a common sight by the people living in the region.
It is not possible for us to. We certainly do not find a system fair where people live in misery on lands rich with oil, gold, diamonds and many other precious metals.
Countries where, on the one hand, the retirement age is 70, and on the other hand, the average human lifespan is only half of this, cannot live peacefully in the same world. When you look at the Earth from space at night, some places are burning brightly,
If some places are plunged into deep darkness, it means there is a problem here. This system, where 6 billion people in the world work for the welfare of only 1 billion, is doomed to eventually become blocked and collapse.
Turkey, not only as a transportation route but also as the crossing point of East and West in every respect, has a historical responsibility in this regard. This is why we say the world is bigger than 5. United Nations Security
The institutions that should lead the way in preventing injustice and injustice in the world, especially the Council, need to reform themselves first. Institutions whose own structure is based on injustice are trying to ensure justice in the world.
It is unthinkable that they provide service. Here you go, look, the West, which shoots down Arabs and Turkmens with planes in Tel Abyad on our border, unfortunately replaces them with the terrorist organizations PYD and PKK. How can we look at this positively? How can we sincerely approach this West?
can we look?
Mr. Numan was in the region yesterday and we did not leave nearly 15 thousand people who escaped from there and took shelter in us in the Aegean Sea or the Mediterranean, we welcomed them into our country; this is us. But we also see the West, they are in the Mediterranean
They condemn us to drowning, we condemn them to drowning in the Aegean, but we cannot allow this. As he read, ""I can't applaud oppression, I can never love the oppressor, I can't stand up and curse the past for the sake of those who come"", that's who we are.
We fulfill the responsibilities that geography and history impose on us, and we will continue to do so. With our Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities, TIKA, Yunus Emre Institute, AFAD, Red Crescent,
We are at the service of humanity and the oppressed all over the world with our non-governmental organizations. We will strive to reach every tear that flows, every voice of a crying baby, every cry for help, and every heart that is saddened. From Muslims in Arakan to Muslims in Iraq
We will continue to lend a helping hand to every oppressed person who needs help, including Yazidis, regardless of any other criteria. With the inspiration we received from Yunus Emre, we will continue to set our feet on this country and travel around the world, as Mevlana said, to make hearts.
We will. In this respect, a very important acquis has emerged, and we will continue to work together in the coming period to carry this knowledge even further and achieve much higher efficiency from the work carried out.
Dear friends,
Turkey has made great progress in every field, from infrastructure to democracy and international relations in the past 12 years, and we have to protect these achievements of our country. Look, growth figures were announced yesterday, they are not ideal,
Thank God, Turkey ranked 14th in the world in this field with its 2.3 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2015. It is essential for Turkey, which has been growing for 22 uninterrupted quarters, to continue this performance and to maintain this continuation and this environment of trust.
We are obliged to attend the summit meeting of the G-20, of which we hold the Term Presidency, to be hosted in Antalya in November, leaving the uncertainty behind.
2023 goals are not the goals of any party, but Turkey's. We must continue to walk in this direction without allowing even the slightest disruption. Those who left Turkey without a government, left Turkey headless, and are doomed to their egos
They will not be held accountable for this either to history or to our nation. Therefore, within the constitutional and legal process, everyone should put their egos aside and establish a government in our country as soon as possible, and this process should continue from where we left off with the understanding that continuity in the state is essential.
As a country that has increased its national income to 800 billion dollars, increased its exports to approximately 160 billion dollars, and reduced unemployment and interest rates to single digits, we can never tolerate going back even one step. Especially
We cannot allow any developments in the political field to reach a level that threatens these gains. This is our responsibility to each of our 78 million people. No one, regardless of their political affiliation, has the right to say ""I"", not ""we"".
We have to say.
As the first President of Turkey to take office with the direct vote of the nation, my personal responsibility in this regard is much greater, I am aware of this. In this context, the parliamentary general meeting that took place last Sunday
The elections opened a new era for our country. On this occasion, I invited Mr. Baykal yesterday, as he is the oldest member of the Parliament, and had a meeting with him. I also evaluated the process, and at the point of evaluating this process, I realized that this work should be done quickly.
I shared with him that I would do whatever I could to ensure its uninterrupted continuation. Because we have ongoing investments, these investments should not be disrupted. Because these investments belong to my entire nation, my country. Disruptions here cause loss to my nation,
It makes my country lose. Therefore, with the awareness that continuity in the state is essential, we said that I and my own people should help in this and we shared this with them.
I hope again that the June 7 general elections will be beneficial for our country and nation. I would like to thank every citizen who went to the polls on election day and expressed their will. More than 86 percent participation
It is very important as it shows where democracy has come from in Turkey. I wonder which of the countries that claim or claim to be proud of democracy have this rate? I don't mean dictatorial regimes, I mean 100 percent in dictatorial regimes.
I'm talking about normal regimes. None of them have such a high participation rate. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every expat who traveled hundreds of kilometers and voted at our consulates general and customs gates.
The result is the will of the nation, everyone must respect the discretion of the nation. The election results show that our nation appreciates a political situation that does not allow a single party to come to power. this table
I hope all political parties read it correctly. This situation, which does not allow a single party to come to power, certainly does not mean that Turkey will remain without a government. The most important feature of democracy is that it finds solutions to such situations.
is that it keeps it open.
Turkey was facing a different situation until the election day, and it is facing a different situation as of Monday. In order for us to go through this period in the healthiest and most undamaged way, we invite all political parties to remain calm.
I invite you to think and take responsibility for the future of the country. No one should have any doubt that, as President, I will fully fulfill the duties assigned to me by the Constitution in this process. The troubles this country has experienced during periods of instability,
I am someone who knows intimately the heavy prices he paid. I am making every effort to leave the process we are in behind without harming Turkey's achievements, and I will continue to do so.
I believe that the parties represented in the Parliament will use their preferences for the solution, not the crisis, within the limits specified in the Constitution and laws. He pinned his hopes on Turkey entering an environment of crisis and chaos.
Hopefully, all the focus groups will be disappointed once again.
I have to explain here that, of course, I find all the ugly, aggressive, and truly degraded Western media statements towards me ugly. It is impossible to understand their intolerance. This
I would also like to express that their intolerance shows something; Thank God, we are on the right track. If they were showering praise then I would have to doubt myself.
With these thoughts, I once again wish our international students who graduated this year success in their future lives.
I ask them to convey our sincere love and respect to their country and society. They need to know this: Turkey's door is always open to them. mutual relations and cooperation
I hope we continue.
I offer you my love and respect, and I entrust you all to God.

Public Addresses in Sivas,2015-06-04,"



Dear people of Sivas,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Sivas gives us excitement and enthusiasm with this painting it displays today. From here, all Sivas people in the districts, neighborhoods and villages of Sivas
I send my love to my brothers and sisters.
On this occasion, I once again wish God's mercy to our brother Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu, the brave son of Sivas and a lover of Turkey, and my condolences to his family and loved ones.
Like Aşık Veysel, the voice and breath of Sivas, we say that we are on a long and narrow road, we go day and night. What did we say when we set out? We will go day and night. We are people of trouble, we are people of love, Sivas is the city of longing and hope.
He understands us very well.
What does the Sivas folk song say:
“Those mountains are great mountains, mountains surrounded by water
If I tell my problem,
""The sky stops and the cloud cries.""
Did the cloud cry today? He cried, thank God. Here we have worked and struggled for 12 years to cure our nation's troubles and heal its wounds. Sivas always supported us in this struggle. Latest 10 August
In the 2014 Presidential election, Sivas demonstrated its trust and confidence in us with a very high rate of 70 percent. Meanwhile, Doğanşar District of Sivas ranked 6th in Türkiye with 91 percent. For this, I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you. I hope for your support,
I will try to be worthy of your compliment.
Those who have Sivas and Türkiye on their side will never be disappointed. Because Sivas is Turkey, and Türkiye is Sivas. Sivas, with its Khorasan saints, tombs, mosques and brave men, is this land, this nation itself. God is our unity,
May our unity and brotherhood be permanent.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
There is no greater guide for a nation than history. These lands witnessed the dissolution and end of a 600-year-old empire. These lands witnessed not only the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but also other pains and other hopes. In Istanbul
When the occupying soldiers landed, when the Greek soldiers set foot on our lands in Izmir, someone welcomed them with flowers and applause. While some people were hugging the neck of the enemy there, people were celebrating the War of Independence here in Sivas with their torn sandals.
was laying the foundations. While some people were negotiating on the map to divide these lands, my bearded grandfather and headscarved grandmother were praying for those gathered at the Sivas Congress. While some are trying to imprison this nation in the blind darkness of history, this nation
He had already started preparations for the War of Independence. Our nation was shouting to the world from Sivas: 'Mandate and protection are unacceptable. Within national borders, the homeland is a whole and cannot be divided. The nation must unite itself against all kinds of foreign occupation and intervention.
It will defend and resist.' Yes, the construction of the Republic of Turkey, the last state of our long journey in history, took place with this consciousness.
When we started this struggle, we did not ask for help other than God's help, we made a covenant, we prayed, we struggled. Our nation protected its flag, its homeland, its honor and its freedom. At the Sivas Congress, the protection of this state and that state
There were also those who wanted it, but these offers were not even deemed worthy of discussion. This nation defended the national will and won the War of Independence. In our entire political life, especially in the last 12 years, we have always fought with the strength we received from the national will.
My brothers,
Today, we appeal to the national will again for the construction of the new Turkey, and that is why we are in Sivas. Those who want a mandate, those who yearn for a single party, and the superior minds who plan to divide the nation and disintegrate the country.
We invite our nation to the ballot box on Sunday to achieve greater defeat.
Is Sivas ready to say its word at the ballot box on June 7? Sivas, is there anyone who can blow the mind of the superior mind? Is Sivas ready to give Turkey its new constitution? Does Sivas have a presidential system? Mashallah, barakallah. Then
no stopping…  Okay?..  Today is Thursday, tomorrow is Friday, Saturday, 3 days, accordingly. Non-stop…
Those who do not hear this voice rising from Sivas have not only their ears sealed but also their hearts sealed. I express my gratitude to you for your enthusiasm and support.
My brothers,
As you know, we held conquest festivals in Istanbul on May 30, and these conquest festivals were 562 years old. Of course, nearly 2 million people came to Istanbul Yenikapı, we were in front of the walls. And my dear brothers, an army of 562 people
We celebrated this with our mehter. Unfortunately, some people could not digest this enthusiasm, these people who could not digest it were supposedly nationalists, supposedly nationalists. And they could not digest these conquest festivals held under the auspices of the Presidency, the Istanbul Governorship and the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality
They could not digest this celebration made by the Municipality. Now we will celebrate every year, because the conquest of Istanbul is not an ordinary conquest.
What was the beloved's lover saying, Istanbul, that is, ""Constantinople will definitely be conquered, what a wonderful emir and what a wonderful army is the commander who conquered it."" But some people are disturbed by this. Do you think Byzantium
left in yesterday? There are ruins of Byzantium today, but we are walking despite them, we will walk despite them.
And they were disturbed, they said, ""What were the Turkish Stars doing there?"" Yes, the Turkish Stars came there with the invitation of the President and did their duty there at that national celebration. Maybe for the first time, 1.5-2 million people
These demonstrations were held in his presence and our nation gained another level of self-confidence that day. Why? My pilots, look at this show, what an amazing, magnificent show they are doing, they have gained self-confidence with this.
Instead of thanking the Turkish Armed Forces, our Air Forces and our pilots, how can the Armed Forces come there and give such an appearance? You understand what the office of the President is. Governorships,
You still haven't understood what municipalities can do on these special days.
Look, we are already inviting Istanbul to May 29 next year. If you want, people from Sivas can also come, there are already many people in Istanbul. Why? Because doesn't the conquest of Istanbul belong only to the people of Istanbul? So all together
we will celebrate.
Dear brothers and sisters,
In this country, every election is, in a way, a new War of Independence, because the struggle for independence and development is an uninterrupted process. Thank you. For this reason, you should not worry if we walked together with the Yığodas. For this our nation
Remember, he declared the elections in which the democratic party came to power as the day of liberation. That day, our nation, men and women, young and old, went to the polls with the spirit of the War of Independence and the excitement of the War of Independence. That day, the ballot box was a field of struggle.
The nation did not run away from this struggle, despite all the pressures and threats, they bravely went to the polls and cast their votes, and God granted this nation the freedom and services it longed for. Then came the May 27 coup, followed by the dark years of the 1970s.
We witnessed the days. This nation, which took a breather with the late Özal, was once again drowned in chaos, crisis and terrorism in the 1990s. Our nation ended this coalition period with us in 2002.
My brothers,
Who did we get the government from? We bought it from DSP, MHP, ANAP, you remember? For how many years did the nation give them this duty? For 5 years. So why did they stay for 3.5 years and then run away, why couldn't they make it work? Because Düzce, Sakarya,
Bolu and Kocaeli were hit by the earthquake and could not move on. Give them 5 sheep anyway and they will lose money. I don't understand why he goes out to the squares. This isn't your job, is it? A Muslim cannot be stung again where he was stung. You can not do it
this job. You either bankrupted 25 banks, left 25 with a burden of 50 billion dollars, we took care of them.
Dear brothers and sisters,
They owed 23.5 billion dollars to the IMF, we paid it. Isn't the Central Bank our national bank? You know, you were a nationalist, what's in the safe? $27.5 billion. What now? 122 billion dollars. Who is a nationalist? We we. We are like that skull
We are not nationalists, we are nationalists who love our nation; This is our difference. Remember, every election was a louder expression of the demand for a new Turkey to those who wanted to hear and understand. Now, there is an election on Sunday, we are on the eve of another War of Independence.
we are in You see, while we are working hard for the construction of the new Turkey, we are faced with an old Turkey coalition. A party that sheds blood from the taps and has blood on its hands, and a party that claims to be nationalist, joined arm in arm and took its place here.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Look, they are opening banners in Batman and saying, 'We crossed the dam, we did, but we couldn't, our home is in the mountains.' Because they are ruled from the mountains, they did not lay down their weapons. Look, one of these co-chairs took to the streets on October 6-7-8.
Didn't he invite? And 50 people died, those who died were Kurds, those who killed were Kurds. So, how come these are representatives of my Kurdish citizen, my Kurdish brother? That's the point.
Now 200 people who claim to be intellectuals have published a declaration. These are not enlightened, they are dark darkness. How come those who support this mentality, which caused the death of 50 people, are intellectuals? How come those who want to darken the future of this country?
Is it also clear? The account is clear, the book is clear, if Aleppo is there, the cubit is here.
My brothers,
Tayyip Erdoğan is a dictator. In a country where there are 90 parties, Tayyip Erdoğan is a dictator. Currently, 20 parties are participating in the elections. How can this dictator happen? Can this happen in a country where there is a dictator? Can you do something like this? In the world
We know and see dictatorship well.
My brothers,
All of them are slander, because these are the remnants of the famous communist regimes, Maoist, Leninist, Stalinist. These are our Azerbaijani brothers on the Boraltan Bridge, yes, the CHP regime of that time handed them over to the Stalin regime and they were held there by Stalin.
their soldiers are martyring our Azeri brothers. And what does an Azerbaijani poet say? ""I wish you had martyred them and not handed them over to Stalin's soldiers.""
My brothers,
Bahçeli is now working to enter the Parliament for these reasons. Look, those who did not give up on us while we were carrying out the solution process so that mothers would not cry, now go and talk to the very people who made mothers cry, take a skullcap and give us a cone.
They are walking the road.
Not only that, the treason network in Pennsylvania and the blood merchant in Qandil also became comrades and took their place in this coalition. Here in the newspapers we see the pictures in full size, we see the pictures side by side. Things that can come together in life
The unthinkable are now coming together. The treason network called the parallel structure receives the greatest support from them while complaining to the world about the aid we send to the Turkmens in Syria.
My brothers,
Look, I have been saying this openly and clearly recently; A newspaper - I will not give its name, for the sake of advertising - shamelessly says that Erdoğan says there is no weapon inside. My dear brothers, whether it exists or not, let's put it aside.
First of all, you are so far from press ethics that you are trying to expose this to the world by taking part in an operation carried out by our National Intelligence Organization in this country. First of all, this is espionage. This is spying, with this
We have already filed a criminal complaint with the judiciary, and necessary action will be taken.
Now, of course, they immediately go to their elders in the world, and by getting support from their elders in the world, they are trying to complain about themselves, us, the government or MİT somewhere. Wherever you go
Go, we have no fear of anyone but Allah. But know that our fight against those who want to divide and disintegrate this nation will continue until the end. Look, I'm telling you from Sivas, this is a place that does not accept buffalo, we do not accept buffalo. And I say it clearly;
This struggle will not end, it will continue until the end. That's why those who insulted my Kurdish brothers until yesterday are now personally going to Qandil, receiving election messages and publishing them. The separatist organization sheds people's blood and takes their lives.
He defends the threat of burning the country to the ground, they advertise the cigarette butts there, look at the situation. Blood flows from the tap on the billboards of the municipality in Van, because they feed on blood. Does blood flow from the tap? Here is their tap
mite. What was it? They don't cut down trees, they just slaughter people. Sivas sees the game, right? If you say Main Opposition, they are already working for others, not knowing what they are doing or saying.
On the one hand, they say that the President is disconnected from the people, on the other hand, they are disturbed by our coming together with our nation. They head to the Supreme Electoral Council, coming and going. Come and see me as much as you want
You will not be able to remove them from this nation of mine. I came from my nation, I am with my nation, I will walk with my nation; know it like this. Because they have become characters of lies and slander.
You see, we were on a live broadcast on TRT recently, right? This Kılıçdaroğlu lies down and gets up, golden toilet, golden toilet, golden toilet. What did I say on air? I said; Come and take a look, if anyone has a gold toilet seat, I am the Presidency.
I will leave your position. But if you cannot prove this, are you ready to leave the head of the Republican People's Party? He can't go, because the evening is a lie, the morning is a lie. Look, didn't he deceive Baykal like this? It came out, journalists asked; are you a candidate? No I'm not
said. But the man is a Chairman who came from a CD or cassette, it would not have been possible for him to become Chairman without that cassette.
In such an environment, we are now going to elections. It's very interesting, I was in Kars, he went to Kars, do you know what he says? ""I will transform the Meat and Fish Institution into the Meat and Milk Institution,"" he says. It's a lie, I already built this place during my term as Prime Minister.
I turned it into a Milk Institution, I did this, it is currently working as a Meat and Milk Institution. Hey my brothers, my brothers who love CHP; A liar cannot be a politician, look, know these.
Another one says, Bahçeli; He says he will remove the fees. They live not in this world, but in another world. I already abolished the fees during my term as Prime Minister. There are university students here, tuition is charged
from you? Hey young people who set their hearts on MHP, my brothers; Do you pay fees? Since you don't pay the fee, why don't you stand up for this lie, this slander, and say: ""A liar and a slanderer cannot become our leader?""
But no matter what happens, I believe that Sunday will be the day the old Turkish coalition ends. Are we blowing up the ballot boxes on Sunday? On Sunday, Sivas, along with the rest of Turkey, cast ballot boxes with a record turnout.
are we dating? Masallah. Today, I see Sivas more determined, more excited. I hope this excitement will last not until Sunday, but until the grave, I believe.
My brothers,
Politics is possible with honesty, principles and a backed stance. Their politics is based on hostility, and hostility towards their own nation. They stand by whatever is against the nation. As in the War of Independence, the enemy country
If he comes in and says; I came to bring down Tayyip Erdoğan. Believe me, they will greet them with flowers in their hands. They have lost so much balance. Be careful, they stand against whatever the people want. The nation protects its religion, its Diyanet,
What do these say? They say we will ban religion classes, there will be no compulsory religion classes. Who says we will abolish the Diyanet? The party behind the terrorist organization. Really? Can a nation without religion survive? They did not stay with him, in the meantime, closing the Imam Hatip schools
They are doing the math. Kılıçdaroğlu says so, what does he say? We will close Imam Hatip schools. He goes to Kayseri and says I didn't say such a thing. What did you say? You said 1+8+3. My brothers, do you know what 1+8 is? Closing the middle part of the imam hatip halls.
We have seen this formula in the past. I am an Imam Hatip graduate, all 4 of my children are Imam Hatip graduates; 2 daughters, 2 sons. But I am troubled, why? My children could not study at university in this country, so I had to send them abroad. Why?
Because they are headscarved. Leaders of other countries were telling me: Isn't your country Muslim? Muslim. So why can't they study there while wearing a headscarf? Unfortunately, due to the current administrations. But he can study in America, many in Europe
can study in the country. As a matter of fact, thousands of our girls and young people went to Europe and other countries. I mean, my brother İsmet just said, you are a stranger in your own country, you are a pariah in your own country, they looked at you like that. Are the middle parts open now? At that time it dropped from 600 thousand to 60 thousand
number of students. What happened now? The number of students increased from 60 thousand to 1 million. Why are you blocking people's way? Let parents send their children wherever they want, what's in it for you? I would talk to them from time to time about what courses were taught in Imam Hatip schools.
They don't even know.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Has the coefficient increased? He got up. Can you get into the university you want? But I also expect success from you; You will enter, and first of all, God, you will surprise them too. It's not over, now the Council of State has announced another decision, what is it? Straight
It paved the way for students to study in high schools while wearing a headscarf. And are the Holy Quran and Prophetic Sirah allowed in regular high schools? Here you go, now the HSYK has announced a decision, saying that you can serve in the judiciary while wearing a headscarf. Oh my God, what are you capable of, from where to where?
we came. Don't take the curse of the oppressed, take it out slowly. The candidate of the Main Opposition is not only disturbed by the call to prayer and the sala, but also insults Hodja Effendi, who reads this from the rally podium. Even the head of the HDP remained silent while the call to prayer was being recited. How far have we come?
The nation turns to its qibla and prostrates itself to its Lord 5 times a day, but the leader of HDP portrays Taksim as the Kaaba. Once upon a time, CHP's intellectual fathers; They said that the Kaaba should belong to the Arabs and Çankaya would be enough for us. My brothers, our Kaaba is in Mecca.
Do you know what they were writing on the walls during those Gezi events? “The persecution began in 1453,” they wrote. We say; That blessed conquest began in 1453, a dark age ended and a bright age opened. The women of Byzantium saw Mehmed the Conqueror in front of the walls,
Yes, they said, ""We would rather see an Ottoman turban on our heads than a Byzantine cone,"" and it was received like this. We are the grandchildren of such ancestors.
Now, as we say let's build the new Turkey, these remind us of the fate of Menderes and Morsi. We are in the squares telling all these games to our nation, the answer comes from the American and British media organizations. Yesterday the buffalo,
Is there a difference between those who defend protection and those who seek help from those headlines today? We are striving to grow, strengthen and enrich Turkey. They are in the mood for a crisis, even if Turkey goes bankrupt. We say stability and trust, they say chaos.
We call for a new constitution, they cling to the coup constitution. We call the presidential system for a stronger, bigger Turkey. These are the crown jewels of the current coalition system, which has wasted 40 years of our country's 70 years. You see the difference, right?
I am calling out to my brothers and sisters who are committed to MHP; They also betray Türkeş. The late Türkeş writes about the presidential system as an indispensable condition in his work titled Dokuz Işık. Pennsylvania, Kandil, Gezi, Armenian
The diaspora and gay associations have united, the Main Opposition and the party claiming to be nationalist have joined them, and the old Turkey continues to form a coalition.
My brothers,
Look, their ideology, like everything else they do, is a lie. We say what we think, we live what we say. As I said, our conversation with our nation is not until Sunday, but with God's permission, until the grave. That's it
Like Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli, all together... We will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, that is not enough, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey all together.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Our agenda is to expand Turkey and Sivas. Is there stability in business in 12 years? Is there trust? Let's take a look at Sivas, what has been done, what has been done. Just the mosque we see in front of us is enough. What was it like and what did we do to it?
isn't it? Because we longed for this: ""These adhans, whose testimonies are the foundation of religion, should moan above my eternal homeland."" Someone said adhan in Turkish, someone said adhan in Kurdish, we said adhan in its original form, Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar; This is our difference.
Do you know how much we invested in Sivas in 12 years? 14 quadrillion, 14 quadrillion. So, how long was the divided road to Sivas until 2002? 24 kilometers in 79 years. So what did we do in the year? We built 699 kilometers of divided road.
Now, hopefully, a high-speed train is coming to Sivas.
We manufacture national freight wagons in Sivas through TÜDEMSAŞ, which we have reactivated, and we will export them to the world soon. The construction of the 600-bed regional hospital continues.
The construction of the stadium with a capacity of 25 thousand spectators continues rapidly. Hopefully, the Yiğidos will be able to play their matches in this new stadium in time for next year.
Whatever can be done for Sivas is little. I will continue to stand by Sivas and the people of Sivas throughout my Presidency, as I did during my presidency. I will be a follower of the work done and new projects, because we are hayrun nas men yenfeu'n
We set off by saying how. So, my dear brothers and sisters, we set out by saying that the best of people is the one who is most beneficial to others and we have prepared Turkey from the history of the Republic in every field from education to health, from transportation to public housing and social assistance.
We act with this understanding while providing more services.
Here is who built Nuri Demirağ Airport in Sivas? We. Who are the people who built those beautiful roads from there to the city? Hallelujah. While we do these things, we do not want to be a gratuitous person, because we want to be your servants, not your masters.
We had already arrived. We act with the same understanding as we strive to bring this country to the highest level in democracy, freedom and human rights.
My brothers,
We are opening the airport in Hakkari, the members of that particular party, the terrorist organization, are closing their shutters in the city center and wreaking havoc everywhere with their masks. Hopefully, in the coming period, we will continue to serve with the love of God, the love of the nation, and the love of God.
We will continue to be with you with love.
You know, we have a Rabia; Remember this, this is valid everywhere. We need this for the construction of the new Turkey.
Now, let's shout from here, from Sivas, the city of national will, so loudly that there will be no one left from Kandil to Pennsylvania who won't hear it. One nation, with its Turks, Kurds, Zazas, Georgians, Abkhazians, Bosnians, Albanians,
With its Circassians, all 78 million people are one nation together. One flag, the color of our flag is the blood of our martyr, the crescent is the expression of our independence, the star is our martyr himself. There cannot be an alternative flag to our flag.
Now I am calling out, you who are considered enlightened, are you with those who raise an alternative flag to our flag, or are you with our flag? If you have an iota of courage, go out and explain this, say this too.
Let this nation see what you are and where you stand.
Fly; One homeland, one homeland with 780 thousand square kilometers. Those who are considering an operation on our country will find us, our Armed Forces, our Police Department, and above all, our nation.
Can a single state be a state within a state? It turns out that there is a parallel state. Look at this situation.
My brothers,
We need to ask this man who goes by the name of Hodja Efendi: Is your retreat place Pennsylvania or America? Come on, what are you doing there when there is Mecca and Medina? But the superior mind ordered it this way, they are there because it ordered it this way.
The problem is different, spreading to the country from there. My brothers, they committed discrimination itself. Now there were little imams. These little imams have also left the altar and are now running away too. They are also in different places; some in America, some in Africa, some over there,
some are here. But you remember what I said when I was Prime Minister, I said we would enter their lair, right? (""Yes"" sounds) Are we in? Now we are chasing. They will run away, we will chase. Because no one has the right to divide this nation, no one has the right to divide this ummah.
he has no right. Those who tear it apart will find us in front of them. We express our Rabia with all our heart and sincerity, together with our nation everywhere, from Izmir to Iğdır, from Trabzon to Hakkari. Have you heard such a voice from the old Türkiye coalition? Because
They are trying to divide the nation, take down the flag, disintegrate the homeland, and collapse the state. They thought that the nation, the flag, the country and the state were abandoned. What does late Akif say: ""It is right for a country without owners to collapse, if you own it, this country will not collapse.""
Does Sivas protect its country? Does Sivas protect its country? God bless you. As long as we are standing, as long as Sivas is with us, as long as our nation is with us, no one will have the power to harm even a single pebble of Turkey.
I thank you once again for your enthusiasm, interest and love. But the ballot boxes will explode, okay? We walked on these roads together, we got wet together in the pouring rain. Now in all the songs I listen to, everything reminds me of you,
Everything reminds me of you, everything reminds me of Sivas.
Best regards, thank you very much.

Their Speech at the 562nd Anniversary Celebration of the Conquest of Istanbul,2015-05-30,"

Istanbul,
Oh dear Istanbul,
I greet you from my heart, Istanbul. I greet you with love, O Mother of Cities, Istanbul.
I salute you in all your districts, all your neighborhoods, all your streets. I salute you with your seven hills, your minarets reaching to the sky, and your spiritual treasures under the ground. I wholeheartedly greet all my brothers from Istanbul.
(Inna Fetahna Leke Fethan Mübina… Ve Yensurakellahu Nasran Aziza…) Indeed, we have granted you a clear conquest and Allah will help you with a glorious victory. And the lover of lovers... (Letüftehanne'l Kostantıniyye. Ve Le Ni'mel Emrü Zalike'l Emr Ve Le Ni'mel
Ceyşü Zalike'l Ceyş) Constantinople will be conquered one day, what a great commander the commander who conquered it, what a great army the army that conquered it.
Happy 562nd anniversary of the conquest. May God be pleased with that conquering commander and the army that conquered him.
O Lord, protect this beloved city. O Lord, do not leave the minarets of this beloved city without the call to prayer. O Lord, do not leave the altars of this beloved city without prostration. O Lord, do not leave the beautiful mosques of this city without congregation.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Today we are celebrating the 562nd anniversary of the conquest in a different way, we wanted it to be a very different celebration.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
It is Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han who brought this city together with adhan and prayer. It is the army of Fatih, whose tongue is prayerful, whose forehead is prostrate, and whose heart is faithful, that brought this city together with Islam. We are pleased with Fatih Sultan Mehmet Khan, O Lord. You are one of those magnificent soldiers, those sacred martyrs.
Be pleased, O Lord. My God, be pleased with that beautiful army. O Lord, be pleased with Sultan Fatih, who ended an era and opened an era, and brought together an obsolete and dark era with the light of civilization.
My brothers,
Istanbul is a city whose every inch is covered not only with the blood of martyrs, but also with the bodies of martyrs. The soldiers who were martyred in the conquest of Istanbul were buried in the place where blood flowed upon the order of Fatih. Today, all roads, all the bases of the city walls, from Rumeli Fortress to Aksaray,
All forests host the bodies of martyrs. Many of the district names of Istanbul today come from the commanders who took part in the conquest of the city. Kocamustafapaşa, Davutpaşa, Altunizade, Kuzguncuk, Bebek and many other district names are relics of the conquest. us these heroes
Do not separate me from your memories, O Lord. Here, in the presence of Istanbul, on the 562nd anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul, O Lord, do not leave us without our share of Fatih.
We promise in the presence of our Lord that we will never allow an unauthorized hand to reach this city. We will not allow the languages ​​that speak to our adhan. We will never allow Fatih and our flag to fall to the ground. The souls of our martyrs and veterans
We will never disappoint. I hope we will continue to walk this path with this love and this belief.
You should know that we will not turn a blind eye to traitors who say that the oppression started in 1453, that the Pontus genocide, or that the Armenian genocide occurred. We will not allow those who try to change Istanbul from being a city where the Quran is read uninterruptedly in grand temples and holy relics. of Istanbul
We will never leave the field to those who want to extinguish the light of conquest that has been burning in their hearts for 562 years. We will not give way to those who use every means to divide this country and tear this nation apart. Do you promise, Istanbul? Do you promise Türkiye? Be a witness, O Lord, be a witness
O Lord, bear witness, O Lord.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
This community of brothers here knows very well what conquest is, we have to look back at our own history and civilization in order to understand what conquest is. What is conquest? Conquest is migration, to the Server of two worlds, Hazrat
Abu Bakr is to be a companion with his loyalty. Conquest is Mecca, cleansing the Kaaba, God's house on earth, from all idols. Conquest is Jerusalem, Hazrat Omar placed the seal of Islam on Masjid al-Aqsa, our first qibla, with respect for all faiths, both Christians and Jews.
is to hit. Conquest is Andalusia, it means building the world's most beautiful architecture, literature and culture with its Cordoba and Granada. Conquest is Samarkand. Conquest is Bukhara, establishing one of the greatest civilizations in history in the steppes of Central Asia. Conquest,
Saladin is Ayyubi, waving the flag of Islam in Jerusalem again in brotherhood. Conquest is Alparslan, opening the doors of Anatolia to this blessed nation, right up to Vienna. Conquest is Osman Gazi, from Sheikh Edebali who said, let the people live so that the state can live
Our aim is to bring together the plane tree that will cover 3 continents and 7 climates with the inspiration we receive. Conquest is a preparation, it is Sultan Murat II's abdication of the throne to his 12-year-old son, Mehmet II. And of course, the conquest is Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, who destroyed the thousand-year-old Byzantium at the age of 21.
It is to embrace the world's most popular city, Istanbul. Fatih conquered Istanbul in 1453, but the conquests always continued before and after, with Yavuz Sultan Selim, Suleiman the Magnificent, Murat the Fourth, and Abdulhamid the Second. Conquest
It is Çanakkale, the conquest is Kut'ül Ammare, it is showing the courage, determination and acumen to challenge the whole world even in the most difficult times.
Conquest is our War of Independence, it means establishing a new state from the ashes of the world empire in poverty and famine. Conquest is May 14, 1950, it is the nation's assertion of its will at the ballot box. Conquest is 1994.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Conquest is to serve Istanbul, this holy land, and the legacy of Mehmet the Conqueror. Conquest means bringing Turkey back to its feet. Conquest means reversing the bad fortune of this country and this nation for the last 12 years and fighting for it. Conquest, hopefully June 7th.
To successfully pass this important milestone on the road to the New Turkey in unity, solidarity and brotherhood. Conquest means being united for the resurrection, for the rise again, being big, being alive, being brothers and being Turkey all together.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
In order to understand the spirit of the conquest, it is necessary to know how this blessed victory was won. After making preparations for the final attack, Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror gathered all his commanders at his headquarters on the evening of May 28, where the final attack would take place on May 29.
Giving the good news, Fatih addressed them as follows: O my pashas, ​​my lords, my lords, my comrades in arms; You will capture a city like Istanbul, whose name is famous all over the world. In the mentioned places of Istanbul, with glory and honor as heroes who captured that city
You will be remembered. Fatih continued; After conquering this city, which always prepares ambushes for us, we will be able to live safely and leave our doors open.
Fatih said that war depended on 3 things; undaunted, honor, obedience. And he finished his conquest speech by saying, ""Once the attack order is given, it is yours.""
You see the spirit of conquest, the consciousness of conquest, right? Those who witnessed that night described the view in front of the walls of Istanbul as follows: When night fell, the Sultan's headquarters was as dazzling as a sea of ​​light. The besieged on the walls
They were watching the ignition of torches and the sounds of trumpets and drums in the valleys. At midnight, all lights and all sounds suddenly stopped, and this silence and darkness had a much more terrible effect than the scene just before.
My brothers,
We are not far from there right now, those walls are here, we are next to those walls right now. And before daybreak, the first attack order was given. Yes, we have many lessons to learn from these words of Fatih and from this scene before the conquest. Our belief is
It is the belief of people whose hands and tongues are safe. Our civilization is the civilization of people whose doors and hearts are open to everyone. Our ancestors claimed conquest not with the understanding that the strong survive, but with the understanding that the strong survive. this is us. We
We will continue to aspire to the power to keep it alive, just as we have done so far.
When we took on the responsibility of governing this country, we acted with the same understanding. We fought for this with the coup plotters, we fought for this with the junta members, we fought for this with the tutelists. From the Turkey of prohibitions to the Turkey of freedoms
We achieved the transition with this understanding. Remember old Turkey, in this country people were insulted because of their beliefs, their appearance, clothes, beards, and women were insulted because of their headscarves. Headscarved mothers and bearded fathers on their children's happiest days
He couldn't be with them, he was watching them from afar in tears. Let alone working in the state or studying at a university, people were even being harassed on the street due to the public space nonsense. I am the father of those children, my children were not stung either.
to schools, they also faced the same situation. The will of the people at the ballot box was being balanced with tanks on the streets. The doors of Imam Hatip schools and Quran courses, which are the institutions of this nation, were locked. That made Fatih's bones ache,
Thank God, we ended this period of humiliation, which tormented the cherished memories of our martyrs and threatened the spirit of conquest, with the support of our nation.
Remember this, dear brothers: Just as conquest is an endless process, the struggle against it is also an endless process.
See what the poet says, young people:
“Victory will make you fly, fly you,
But know that if your will is shaken,
If fear grips your heart for a moment,
What if your eyes darken from such a flight?
Or if you get a little enraptured and distracted,
Victory will suddenly throw you off your back.”
There will be no wavering in our will, if there is a wavering in our will then victory will throw us away, because, my dear brothers, victory is not the work of cowards. Turkey has to be strong, we will be strong so that we can reach out to all our brothers and the whole world.
We will support our brothers wherever they are needed, with the belief that the hand that gives is better than the hand that receives.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Abdulhamid II not only reached our brothers in Aceh, but also sent aid to Ireland, which was suffering from hunger. With this understanding, we continue aid activities in every corner of the world, we oppose oppression wherever there is oppression.
Wherever there is a victim, we stand with them. If we say the world is bigger than 5 at the United Nations, this is why we say it. We act with this understanding in Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq and Libya. To our compatriots in Cyprus and Crimea,
It is with this feeling that we reach out to our brothers in the Balkans. This is why we were in Kosovo, this is why we were in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this is why we were in Macedonia and we will continue to be there. This is why Türkiye is in Africa. We know that the real conquest is
It is the conquest of hearts. What does Yunus Emre say about this: ""The home of a friend is hearts, we have come to make hearts."" This is us.
Dear brothers and sisters,
While we are working, progressing, struggling, those in front of us do not stand idle; they seize every opportunity to block our path, change our direction, and above all, within this framework. There is a rag called the New York Times in America, this newspaper
As he has done many times before, he recently published an article about us; Well, there are dark clouds over Turkey. They tried to criticize us through two media outlets that are currently leading all kinds of discord in our country. this newspaper
He was writing for Sultan Abdulhamid in 1896, similar to what he says and writes for us today. What was he saying? Insufferable man, indescribably bad Turk, he said, despot, absolute. This newspaper was devoted to the Ottoman Empire and its leader that day.
Today, he directs the hatred he vomited against the Republic of Turkey and the person who represents it.
He made similar publications for the late Menderes and the late Özal, and made headlines saying that people were happily praising the regime after the May 27 coup. By the way, let me tell you that the owners of the newspaper are always the same family, there is no change in the line, it is the same family.
This newspaper, known for its closeness to the Armenian lobby, has recently been in close cooperation with Pennsylvania. Look, do you see who Pennsylvania is involved with?
I told you recently, he escaped from here in '99. Where did it go? To America. Weren't you Hodja Effendi, what are you doing in America? What if you went to Mecca or Medina? Now imams are also running away, imams. What if the imam leaves the altar? And they all leave.
As we said, we will enter their lair and we are. Because this is also a conquest, this conquest must happen.
This newspaper was the main proponent of the lie that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2001. This newspaper, which has a very bad record on democracy, declared a mobilization against me together with media groups in Turkey that follow the same path. Of course we are these
We are aware of the real pain in the stomach that starts from Davos and extends to Mavi Marmara, and we know very well the reason behind their hostility towards Abdulhamid.
But from here, from Istanbul, from Yenikapı, from the conquest celebrations, I call out to them and say; You will not be able to make us give up our first qibla with little. You will never make us stop standing by our brothers. In this country, the last adhan is silent, the last call to prayer is
You will not be able to achieve your goal before the flag comes down and the last smoking stove goes out. Don't send messages that the grave is waiting for you through your puppet in Pennsylvania who loves you very much. We are people who believe in it. In vain, it is complicated to be devoted wholeheartedly to the conquest of Istanbul.
Don't try to insult us by calling it a disgrace, we will defend conquest and the spirit of conquest until the end. We will protect the legacy of our martyrs until the end.
Brothers and sisters, remember:
“The hill of martyrs is not empty,
Heroes await your land.
And to wave a flag,
The wind is waiting.
The epic of the orphan, the unknown soldier whose silence is deep,
His tomb suits this sacred hill.
The land where it lies is clear,
The flag he is holding is obvious,
""Who said it was an unknown soldier?""
Yes, the land we lie on is clear, the flag we hold is clear. That's why we have Rabia, our Rabia. We know our Rabia, right? What is our Rabia?
One nation, with its Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, Bosnians, Albanians, Roma, in short, one nation.
Two; single flag. The color of our flag is the blood of our martyr, the crescent is the expression of our independence, the star is our martyr himself.
What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if anyone dies for it. One homeland with 780 thousand square kilometers. Nobody should think about an operation on our country, they should know that they will find our heroic army, they will find our security force, above all
They will find our nation beyond.
What do the people say? He says, ""Oh my God, Taksim is our Kaaba."" Our Kaaba is obvious, it is in Mecca. What do they say after that? We will abolish Diyanet, we will abolish religion classes. 99 percent of this nation is Muslim, a place where a Muslim is stung will not be stung again and
No one has the power to divide these lands.
Four, one state. Never a state within a state. They should know that they will find the Republic of Turkey against those who attempt to threaten our national security. Pennsylvania, what state? Know your limits first. That's why we entered these lairs now, we are chasing, we will chase.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We know very well what those who raise flags against our flag in this country are. Now some intellectuals have emerged, they are not intellectuals, they are dark, they are dark, I cannot call those who stand with those who raise flags against our flag as intellectuals. 15 in this country
We cannot call those who defended those who stabbed a 2-year-old young man by throwing him from the 3rd floor and running over him with a car, and those who caused the death of 50 people, as intellectuals.
Dear brothers and sisters,
That's why we determined our position very well. Do you know what our nation says about such situations? He who eats the infidel's bread steals the infidel's sword; Enough of stealing swords against this nation. They stole KPSS questions, they stole the nation's zakat, alms, and sacrifices.
They stole the sustenance of the nation's children by saying ""himmet"". My dear brothers, they blocked the aid we sent to our brothers in Syria and stole their lives. He shamelessly and tirelessly began to speculate about the aid sent to the Bayırbucak Turkmens.
They entered. This is espionage, this is espionage, and they will pay for it. Think about it from the nation's side. You should know that the place where you keep attacking like a kamikaze, as Yahya Kemal says, is the place we hold tightly with the cry of ""victory, because this is the last army of Islam"".
It is Turkey. You should know that this homeland belongs to those who stand like a mountain range in the dark heart of the land.
My brothers,
We continue our path with faith and determination, we will continue and we will never make such a concession to them. We will continue to walk towards our 2023 goals with the deep love and affection we have for our nation.
My brothers,
Here, I would like to address you from the Farewell Sermon of our beloved Prophet, especially because it is very, very important: “O people, your Lord is one, your father is also one, you are all children of Adam, and Adam is from dust. Arab to non-Arab, non-Arab to
It has no superiority over the Arab. A red-skinned person has no advantage over a black one, nor does a black person have any superiority over a red-skinned person. Superiority is only in piety and fear of Allah.” Justice, mercy, love and salvation are expressed here.
Hopefully, 2053 will herald a period in which all people will live peacefully with this understanding within their own beliefs, their own culture and their own geography. 1453 was a conquest of civilization with Istanbul, hopefully in 2053 it will be for the benefit of all humanity.
It will witness the reopening of the doors of a blessed civilization for the benefit of all humanity.
Now, young people, you are the ones who will build the Turkey of 2053 and make our dreams come true in the Turkey of 2053. Your task is big and heavy. Fatih was 21 years old when he conquered Istanbul, but that young man who entered the gates of Istanbul as Fatih,
Along with his native language, he also knew Arabic, Persian, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He personally designed the cannons that beat the walls of Istanbul and made the conquest plan. He knew the balances in his region and the subtleties of diplomacy very well.
He personally commanded it. The conquest in 1453 was carried out by such a well-educated commander. You, who are civil servants and aspirants to establish the Turkey of 2053, must also educate yourself very well. We want to establish this infrastructure for you with this understanding.
We worked as hard as we could for this, and we will continue to do so.
Our ancestors built the Boğazkesen Fortress and the Rumeli Fortress before Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Istanbul, and today, as our Prime Minister has just stated, we are building a new airport, the third bridge across the Bosphorus, the Eurasia Tunnel, the Izmit Gulf passage, the rapid by train,
We are making preparations for 2053 with metro lines. Our ancestors, Fatih, ran the ships on land, and we ran the rail systems under the Bosphorus with Marmaray. We have provided Turkey with services worthy of the spirit of conquest in education, health, transportation and every field.
With the belief that the real conquest is the conquest of hearts, we made an effort to embrace our 81 provinces, 78 million people, and all our brothers in our geography. We laid the foundations of our 2053 vision with our 2023 goals. Of course we have our shortcomings, but our efforts
and there is not the slightest decline in our sincerity.
I expect each of you to raise yourself like Fatih the Conqueror and prepare yourself for the future with the consciousness of conquest. A youth with a heart like Hazrat Hamza, a sense of justice like Hazrat Omar, literature like Hazrat Yusuf, courage like Hazrat Ali, and wisdom like Fatih.
You must be. You must be a youth who bows only in bowing and bows only in prostration. You must be a thinking, rational and struggling youth. You can trace your roots in the wisdom of Ahmet Yesevi, Yunus, Mevlana, Hacı Bayram-ı Veli, Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli.
You should look for it in their advice. Dear young people, I see this spirit, this dynamism in you.
Do you know what our author says? “In fact, Mehmet the Conqueror conquered Istanbul so that Mimar Sinan could build Suleymaniye,” he says. You should look for your roots in the subtlety here. The real great conquest is the conquest made with civilization, science, wisdom and culture.
You should never forget. May you be a knowledgeable, virtuous, working youth, as Mehmet Akif Ersoy envisioned in Asım's generation.
Now I say, let's not forget this together, what the late Arif Nihat Asya says:
“These books are Fatih, Selim, Süleyman.
That mihrab is Sinanüddin, that minaret is Sinan.
Come on now, wake up your sleeping epic.
I don't know why you are in a rush with daily tasks,
My daughter, you are old enough to give birth to Fatihs.
My young man, the day you received the sign from your father,
You will walk, the people will walk behind you,
I bring you greetings from Ulubatlı Hasan.
You are the fabric that will become a flag for the zodiac signs,
You are at the age when Fatih conquered Istanbul.
Let the broken clocks run falsely.
Let the Çelebis retire and winter in harems,
Go, my lion, let the preparations for conquest begin.
Walk on, why are you still playing around,
""You are at the age when Fatih conquered Istanbul.""
Once again, I wish you and our entire nation a happy 562nd anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul.
I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for coming here to Yenikapı, participating in the conquest program, commemorating the memory of Fatih, and worshiping the souls of our veterans and martyrs.
Our Prime Minister, Governor, Metropolitan Mayor, who contributed to the organization of this magnificent conquest program, our Turkish Armed Forces Janissary Unit, our Turkish Air Force Turkish Stars, and those who prepared other shows.
I congratulate our teams.
I pray that God keeps the joy of conquest in our hearts, and I offer my love and respect to all of you.
Thank you, long live, God bless you.

Their Speech at the Mass Opening Ceremony in Van,2015-05-14,"



Dear people of Van,
Dear Brothers and Sisters;
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings, love and affection. I send my greetings from here to my brothers in all districts, all neighborhoods and all villages of Van. Van once again embraced us with longing, we thank you.
I do.
On the occasion of this visit, we are inaugurating 80 works completed in Van, with a total investment cost of 1 quadrillion 412 trillion liras.
My brothers,
I came to Van again in October 2013 and held the mass opening of the investments with an investment value of 1.5 quadrillion liras. As you can see, we have brought services to Van in portions of 1.5 quadrillion, and we are still doing so.
Do you know what the total investment we have made in Van in the past 12 years? Exactly 17.5 quadrillion liras. Do you know what the total investment we have made in our Eastern and Southeastern regions in 12 years? 260 quadrillion liras at this year's prices, that is
approximately 100 billion dollars. In our country, the name of our Eastern and Southeastern Regions has been associated with neglect, underdevelopment, poverty and poverty for years. Do Van's roads have any shortcomings today than the roads of other regions? Today, other schools and universities in Van
Is there anything left of the schools in the regions? Are there any aspects of the hospitals and services in Van that lag behind the services in other regions? Is there any need to go to Ankara or Istanbul for any heart surgery anymore? From where to where. These
He came with us, these things were with us. Our public housing in Van has more and less than other regions. Look at the public housing in Erciş, overlooking the sea, not Lake Van, as you know, the Van sea, overlooking the sea. Look at the ones in Edremit, they overlook the sea. These
we we we we did. Why? We did not distinguish my Kurdish brothers in Van from Turks, Zazas, Arabs, Laz, Georgians and Abkhazians. We loved the creation because of the Creator. And this is how we carried out these investments. What was I telling you? Whatever is in the west is in the east
I thought it would happen. Did these happen? It happened, it will happen from now on. Despite this, if Van is not where we want it to be today, believe me, it is not because of us. You understand what i am saying, do not you? You know very well those responsible for this. In these elections
Does Van protect its future? Does Van choose service in these elections? But that's not the Pennsylvania service, let's not confuse them.
I pray that God will make our unity, solidarity and brotherhood permanent. I express my gratitude for your enthusiasm and love.
My dear brothers and sisters;
Today, with the mass opening ceremony, we are officially opening 41 separate buildings consisting of high schools, secondary schools, primary schools, hostels and other units in education, including Mehmet Akif Ersoy High School, Anatolian Teacher High School, Akdamar.
Anatolian High School, Ayhan Şahenk Autistic Children Education Center, various Anatolian high schools, was there an Anatolian high school in the past? Was there a science high school in the past? Were there schools for the disabled in the past? There are 6 separate hostels with a capacity of 200 students each. our university
It has implemented 9 different projects, from technoparks to infrastructure works, with an investment of 22 trillion liras.
Our Ministry of Youth and Sports completed the construction of 12 Giant Men Gym in Erciş. Our Ministry of Culture and Tourism Van Castle restoration, Akdamar Church landscaping, Abdülhakim Arvasi Mosque restoration, Faki Teyran house
completed its restoration. As you know, Faki Teyran's Divan, written in Kurdish, was published in two volumes by our Ministry of Culture and Tourism. And I presented it to you in this square. Now we are working on the restoration of Faki Teyran's house.
By doing this, we protect the memory of this important value of both Van and our country. We are holding the official openings of all these works here today.
It's not over, the Oral and Dental Health Center and the service building of our Provincial Health Directorate have been completed. Our Ministry of Development completed the construction of the Fair Center and Urartian Museum with an investment of 84 trillion liras. AFAD public housing
It has completed 15 different landscaping projects, 23 different energy transmission lines and drinking water and various infrastructure projects in the regions where it is located, with an investment of 81 trillion lira. Now let me take a look at Erciş. Is the construction of Erciş Palace of Justice finished? All these services
We are holding their official opening today.
Now I'm asking my brothers, Van, those who watch us on their screens, I'm calling out to you; Do you know how many divided roads there were in Van in 2002? 36 kilometers. How long did it take? In 79 years. What have we done to Van in 12 years?
How many divided roads did we save? 475 kilometers.
Now I ask; O my Kurdish Brother, will you vote for service or for those who shed blood from taps? Look, blood was flowing from the taps on the billboards and at the bus stops, but when the criticism started, I looked at it today.
The color of the water flowing from the taps has changed. Oh my Kurdish brother, my dear brother; We are in love with you, but you have difficulty understanding us. I exalt my brothers in this field, but you need to explain this. Because my dear brothers and sisters, June 7 is a
is the breaking point. In this respect, it is very important whether those who support terrorism will win on June 7 or those who love this nation.
Look, we are inaugurating 6 separate divided road projects, the construction of which has been completely completed. We are not among those who bow down to the leaders of illegal organizations that appear legal. For us, worship is only for Allah. We have no servitude to the people,
There is only worship to Allah.
My brothers,
Our Ministry of Internal Affairs built new Police Department service buildings in Muradiye, Erciş, Tuşba and Edremit districts. A new building was built for the Van Land Registry Directorate. Our Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has completed the Ağrı-Van energy transmission line.
built it. Our Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs has implemented 13 stream improvement and 3 flood protection projects. Currently, Van Municipality was not providing water to Van. During my term as Prime Minister, I gave instructions to DSI and Veysel Bey, and we solved Van's water problem.
We. Actually, this was the duty of the Municipality, but they did not do it. But my citizens lived here, and we solved their problem.
My brothers,
I hope that all these works will be beneficial to our Van, my brothers from Van, and our country. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank our Government, ministers, relevant institutions and contractor companies for making these investments possible.
I do.
On this occasion, I once again wish God's mercy to all our brothers and sisters who we lost in the 2011 earthquake, and I pray for patience for their relatives.
We came here during the earthquake, we were wandering around at night, Erciş, Van, and I saw that there was no municipality in sight. They don't have any work machines, they are missing. My dear brothers, but Ankara did not stop, it mobilized with all its means. And we after the earthquake
what did we say? We said we would make Van more beautiful as soon as possible, did we? Did we bring our districts? Currently, my Kurdish brothers from Van were sent out of Van in a short time and returned to the houses that have now opened. Thank God for everything we promised
we did. We cannot bring back our losses, but I believe we have fully compensated for the destruction caused in the city during the earthquake. Van now looks to its future with more hope and confidence. Hopefully, in cooperation, we will make Van a shining city in the region of Turkey in 2023.
We will make it a star. From now on, we will work to achieve this goal.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As I just stated, during my last visit to Van, I showed Faki Teyran's book Divan, published by our Ministry of Culture and Tourism. This publication is a sign that rejection, denial and assimilation policies are now a thing of the past in Turkey.
I shared it with you as an example.
Do you know what the opinion leaders here wanted from me when I came here and wandered around when I founded our party? They were saying; They were saying, ""Mr. President, lift this State of Emergency, that's enough for us."" And we in the Southeast, in the East
Quickly, Abdullah Bey was the Prime Minister at that time, we lifted the state of emergency within a month. We kept our word. But it was not over and after that we started to meet the needs of the region, infrastructure and superstructure.
Look, today I am showing you the Kurdish translation of the Holy Quran. I had previously shared the joy of this with my brothers in Batman, Diyarbakır, Siirt and Mardin. God bless our President of Religious Affairs, especially those who contributed.
May he be pleased to be. Of course, some people were disturbed by me sharing the Kurdish translation of the Quran with you. Even the co-chairman of the terrorist-supporting party said; This does not actually belong to the Presidency of Religious Affairs, this is a Quran prepared by a private foundation.
It means Kurdish. In another he said; This was printed as 1 and sent to the President. The very next day, the Presidency of Religious Affairs gave its answer. He said; In the first stage, we printed 10 thousand Kurdish Quran translations and sent them to the region.
He said we are sending it.
My brothers,
I know that their discomfort actually stems from the Quran itself. They already say this openly. What do they say? Do they say that compulsory religion classes should be abolished from schools? Why should it be removed, why bother?
are you becoming? Compulsory religious education exists as a mandatory provision of the Constitution. How is there? It exists as a lesson in religious culture and morality, right? Oh, and did we also include it as an option? Whether it's him or her, don't be disturbed. And we are taking these steps, why?
My brothers,
Look, this is very important: It is right for a nation without faith to fail; if you own it, this nation will not fail. Now, of course, the Quran will disturb those who are looking for new Kaabas. You know who these are too. Mine
My Kurdish brothers are loyal to their religion, they have their religion. So, I think it will give the necessary answer to the rulers who adopted the religion of Zoroastrianism as their religion. This is the lesson they give in caves in the mountains. As a matter of fact, there is one so-called mufti in Diyarbakır.
what did he say; He said, ""If my party's religion was Zoroastrianism, I would still be a candidate from there."" This is the so-called mufti. Look at this situation, where we have come from.
My brothers,
Remember; Do you know what the single party CHP chose for itself? They said the Kaaba should belong to the Arabs, Çankaya would be enough for us. Is there any difference between these? Take one and hit the other. Now the party under the control of the separatist organization is its own Kaaba.
He decided on Taksim. We, our nation, will continue to protect both our Kaaba and our Quran. The Kaaba of my brother from Van is obvious, right? Let me see your hands, okay? Thanks. To the marginals, to all extremes, to all perversions
This nation will never respect those who do not give the Kaaba the same value as they do to those inside it. They lost the compass in politics, now they have no qibla, they have lost their qibla. God forbid it surprises me. Once you enter this path, God knows where you will stop.
You see, they came up with the idea of ​​shutting down the Diyanet as a project during the election. What do you have against Diyanet? They want the Diyanet to be closed and the mosques and the community to be left abandoned; that's their problem. CHP did this once, right? Did CHP close mosques? sold
? Did he turn these places into stables? He did all this. Now, this is the problem of the Party that supports terrorism. Will my brother from Van allow this? Together with the Diyanet, they have now set their sights on Imam Hatip schools. I didn't go into details just now. But opening today
Among the educational institutions we operate, there is an imam-hatip girls' hostel. There is 3 Nisan Imam Hatip Secondary School, there is Van Lake Imam Hatip Secondary School. We are opening imam-hatip schools, but they appear before the nation saying they will close these schools. They don't say this openly,
what do they say? The 4+4+4 practice in education will be ended. What does the Main Opposition Party say? He says that the 1+8+4 system will be switched to. Let them love you. They've made up this formula before. And they closed the middle parts of the Imam-Hatip schools. There are some of you who know this, some of you who don't
there is. Do you know what the number of students was in Imam Hatip Schools back then? It was over 600 thousand. Of course, when the middle parts were closed, the number gradually decreased to 60 thousand.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
My nation now knows what these passwords mean. We're here, have we opened the middle parts? Have we removed the coefficients? Did we lift the quota? Did we say that imam hatip schools and vocational high schools can enter all universities? Now where is the number?
rose? Yes, it increased from 60 thousand to 1 million, to 1 million. But now I want something from you; You will work hard, you will strive, and I believe you will graduate from universities successfully.
My Brothers from Van;
I was in Albania yesterday, maybe you watched it on TV. We laid the foundation of the Namazgah Mosque in Albania, right in the center of the capital Tirana. It's a wonderful place. It turns out that 130 years ago, it was once again a prayer mosque. history again
it comes to life. It is a beautiful work with magnificent architecture. I hope it will stand up there in 2 years. And from there…  We are proud of you, we are proud of you. Your presence gives us strength.
My brothers,
TİKA is in a historical castle in Preze…  Thank you, thank you. And TİKA built the demolished mosque inside the Preze Castle, we went to its opening. It was a very emotional painting. There were over 5 thousand participants, all the way from Kosovo...
My brothers, young people came from all over the Balkans. And they also came from Shkodra Imam Hatip. There, our young girls presented us with a beautiful painting, and a young girl sang a truly silent scream that touched us.
Now I praise my Lord; My God, where and how is this generation being raised?
Now I ask; Will Van allow the abolition of Diyanet? So isn't June 7 important? Shouldn't something be done? And here they are attacking our President of Religious Affairs. The party supported by terrorism is also attacking, in parallel
The structure is also attacking, they have joined hands, the Main Opposition is attacking, there is no such thing as respect or concern among them. And it's very interesting, very interesting, what do they say? That Mercedes is the source of the work they will do, and they put a price on it. My dear brothers, what happened?
Its value is 1 million, 1 trillion in old numbers. No such thing. Yesterday, during my trip to Albania, we were with our President of Religious Affairs. I asked, ""For God's sake, what is the price of this?"" He said, 330 thousand liras. Now, most of those who make this slander have a Mercedes behind them. In Turkey
What could be more natural and more natural than having a Mercedes vehicle allocated to the office in our huge Presidency of Religious Affairs? And are we ready together to teach the necessary lesson to those who rudely and immorally attack our President of Religious Affairs and his family? This
We will protect the authorities, we need to protect them.
Dear Brothers and Sisters;
If religious opinion leaders are not protected at this point, you should know that this is just like the imam at the end of the rosary, just as the rosary disperses when that imame breaks, yes, the leaders in front of us, we will disperse in the same way when they disappear. This
We will not give it a chance, are we ready for this? Thanks.
Will Van allow imam hatip schools to be closed? That's what we say anyway. I believe that this nation will give the answer they deserve to those who nominated those who created the Alevism mischief without Ali. Here is what the terrorist organization supports
Unfortunately, in this political party, there is also one of the leading Alevists without Ali. I did not know Alevism like that. I met Hazrat Ali as those who loved him. And if Alevism means loving Hazrat Ali, I am Alevi, I am Alevi. But they don't have such a problem. coup plotters
Our nation will give the answer it deserves to those who work day and night for their country, foaming at the mouth and cursing it while declaring it a place in heaven, right? Are we ready for this?
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
When I was a candidate for the Presidential election held on August 10, 2014, I made a promise to my nation, I said that I would be a different President. I will be a President who is clearly on the side of the nation, not neutral.
I said. Now Türkiye is on the eve of a new election. If you pay attention, I also travel around Turkey, meet and embrace my nation on the occasion of mass opening ceremonies. I will be in Kırıkkale tomorrow. My dear brothers and sisters in Istanbul on Saturday, Sunday
I will be in Kayseri on the day. Hopefully Samsun, we are wandering around on Monday. I am explaining my new Turkey vision, my new constitution and presidential system proposal to my nation and asking for support for this. To realize this vision after the election without mentioning any party name
I say: 400 MPs are needed. Whom do I want? I want it for whoever will bring this vision to life. They also criticize my conversation with my nation and my call for a new Constitution. Opposition parties are constantly appealing to the Supreme Electoral Council.
Let me tell you what they say; They say this President should not take to the streets. Especially the party that supports this terrorist organization applied twice. He received a rejection response both times, but he doesn't get tired and continues again. They don't know the Constitution or anything, read the Constitution.
no such thing. You cannot stop the President, he will come out and speak in the squares, as long as he finds people to talk to in the squares. I am with my nation right now, I am with my nation in Van, and I am with my friends and compatriots in Albania. upcoming
I will be in Bosnia and Herzegovina next week, the same way. We will travel both in our country and around the world. Why? Yes, it is not appropriate for this nation to be small and think small. We will act in accordance with the greatness of this nation. As you know, the issue of the new constitution is on the agenda for the first time.
It's not something I brought up. If you remember, we made a comprehensive constitutional amendment in 2010. This amendment was a pioneer and a test of the demand for a new Constitution. Because we were fortified and served the nation on September 12, the foundations of which were laid with the May 27 coup.
We want this imposed coup Constitution to be changed. On this occasion, today is May 14, a meaningful day, and I had heralded Yassıada in the previous elections as follows: I said that we would make this island an island of freedom and democracy. There Yassiada and Sivriada
there is. I had the project of these two islands done, and our sister Çiğdem Hanım, who was a member of the Central Decision Board of Directors at the time, had done this project with her team. And today, our esteemed Prime Minister, together with all his family, as well as our ministers and members of parliament.
They laid the foundation. And so, I thank them on behalf of myself and my nation. Because this project will not be a national project, it will be an international project, and this project is a project that creates a basis for shouting out what democracy is, what freedom is.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I want the new constitution to be made by my nation, not by this or that tutelage institution. Remember, in the 2010 referendum, there were 14 political parties that came together against us in the Presidential election last year, and today we
All the critics came together. My dear brothers and sisters, while we were trying to erase the remnants of September 12, they persistently protected the legacy of September 12.
The person who carried out the September 12 coup died recently. At his funeral, our eyes looked for those who claimed the legacy of the coup plotters in 2010, but we could not see them. When it comes to erasing the traces of September 12, those who take sides against us are using September 12 as their own.
They did not come to the funeral of the person who did it. But we know that they were there with their hearts and minds, and at the forefront.
Those who claim to represent those who were subjected to the most severe torture in the September 12 dungeons chose to follow the coup plotters' path, not democracy's, in 2010. Because they are the products of the September 12 coup,
They show that they are at every opportunity.
Look, the parallel structure has a leader in Pennsylvania, what does this leader say? Said Nursi says that he did not go and visit him because he was a Kurd, thus openly expressing his hatred towards my Kurdish brothers. What did they do? We are parallel
While we were fighting the structure with all our strength, they entered into an alliance with this structure and made a cooperation agreement at the back doors of Diyarbakır Metropolitan Municipality. In Istanbul, there have been people who have insulted my Kurdish brothers, provoked them, and tortured them in all kinds of ways.
They cooperated with all the tutelaries who thought it was appropriate. They are so close that they will almost merge their headquarters with the party that is the current representative of the CHP, the only party that has never stopped torturing my Kurdish brothers.
They speak with the same voice and the same style in the squares as the party that is the most passionate advocate of rejection and denial policies towards my Kurdish brothers. They have all become one, they have given up on their work, my dear brothers, they are only criticizing the government and telling lies and lies.
there is everything. Say what you say for the nation, for the future of the nation, and produce a project.
Then they mess with me; And what are you doing with me? I am talking about a new constitution. Do you have any thoughts or alternative proposals on this issue? bring it. I say presidential system. You may be satisfied with the current situation,
But you are unaware that Turkey needs a new system to guarantee a climate of stability and trust. Believe me, give them 5 sheep, they will lose and come back.
Here is one of the opposition parties, as you know, MHP, wasn't it in power, wasn't it a coalition partner? With 3.5 years left, they abandoned it and went to early elections. Likewise, the party, which is the offspring of the Main Opposition, is also in power.
He was a partner, they broke the coalition and went to early elections. And we had just established our party, we came to power on our own in 16 months; this is the difference.
What do we say now? We call it 2023 goals. We are only reaching these 2023 targets with a new administrative structure, and that's why I'm talking about big projects. What is in the projects I described? There is Marmaray. Do they have such a project?
Besides, I'm not going to talk nonsense, look, it's been 18 months since Marmaray was opened, do you know how many people have passed through Marmaray so far? 73 million people passed.
My brothers,
This is how we provided service. But there are other beauties in our understanding of service. While we were doing this, they said you can't do it to us. But they didn't know that, as my daughters said, we took lessons from our grandfather Fatih, we built those ships.
He ran it on land, and we ran the subway under the sea; This is our feature. Do Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Arabs, Georgians, Bosnians, Pomaks, Roma, everyone pass through this subway? Is there any distinction? Does wearing a headscarf or wearing a headscarf go unnoticed? A few people who didn't pass
So, do you understand who they are? Do you know that out of spite? If I pass, they will wonder if I passed, he is worried about this. Don't worry, we won't say anything late, because we did this for 78 million.
And now we are building the second tunnel, again under the sea, double-storey, we will open it next year, cars will pass through there, it continues.
And we have two bridges, now we are building the 3rd one and this 3rd bridge is the widest bridge in the world, 4 departures, 4 arrivals, and a high-speed train passes through the middle. Hopefully, it will catch up unless something extraordinary happens by the end of this year. And these
We don't have any money problems while doing it. But as some people say, I will give it this way, I will give it that way. Where is the source? No.
We also know the period when they were running hospitals. You know how this person managed hospitals when he was SSK General Manager in 1998, right? These are all the same, take one and hit the other.
You see the situation in the municipalities run by the terrorist party right now, right? Here is Van, everything is obvious when you enter the back streets. Municipality, my brothers, is a service to its people with its bright infrastructure and superstructure.
Can the cheese ship sail with words?
Is it possible to move democracy, rights and freedoms forward by clinging to the legacy of September 12? While we have been struggling since 2010 to close and ban parties and bring coup plotters to justice, these are in our Parliament.
appeared before us, Prime Minister and we are making the 2010 constitution, my dear brothers, I told them all the same thing, I said come on, let's prevent the closure of the parties, the Main Opposition, MHP, HDP left the Parliament, they left. Now they say that these parties should be closed down.
It didn't prevent it. Don't lie, be honest. All of these are in the parliamentary records. Unfortunately, a few of us sold out, and they left that Parliament. When they left, we could not reach the referendum number. If we had, my dear brothers, we would not be able to reach the parliament right now.
Closing the parties would be history. No matter what they do, they will not be able to prevent the construction of the new Turkey.
Van will give the answer it deserves to the party under the control of the separatist organization, the parallel organization and the Main Opposition that follows them, I believe this.
Now I'm asking here, Hey Van, are you ready for the new Turkey? Does Van want a new constitution? Does Van support the presidential system? Does Van protect its future? God bless you.
We will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will all be Turkey together; we need it. May God perpetuate our unity, solidarity and brotherhood. Ankara Chamber of Industry
My brothers, of course the election is not over yet, but those who have given up hope on the election already have their excuses ready. Do you know what they say? In 2011, they were saying that they would not have the new constitution even if we got 400 deputies, but now they are saying similar things.
they express. They blame the nation whose votes they seek, and say that if the outcome they want is not achieved, the nation deserves everything. They are already showing the street as the address, not the Parliament. A political party can only hold rallies on the streets,
What does terrorizing and calling on innocent people to set fire to their homes, vehicles and shops have anything to do with politics? Weren't they the ones who invited people to the streets and caused the death of 50 people?
What does the Northern Iraqi Administration say? He says that if it were not for Türkiye, Kobani would not have been saved. What do these say? He blames us. My brothers, did we take all our Kurdish brothers who were under bombardment in Kobani to Turkey? Tents, container
Did we settle them in the cities?
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
They are lying. And it is very interesting, look, we allowed both the Free Syrian Army and the Peshmerga to enter Kobani from our lands. Could they have gone if we had not allowed them? Hey HDP, who are you? You don't manage this
Since we are the ones managing it, we allowed it and they left. Why? Because DAESH had to be taught a lesson in Kobani. The DAESH terrorist organization also blames Turkey, the separatist organization also blames Turkey, so they have something in common.
While the blood of the people who died because of his call to take to the streets is on his hands, the conscience of anyone who still talks about democracy, freedom and rights has dried up.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We are trying to dry the tears in the eyes of mothers by taking all kinds of troubles, difficulties and risks with the solution process. But you know how my Kurdish mothers, whose children were kidnapped to the mountains, were made to cry, right? For days, weeks, months
made you cry? Who are the kidnappers? Need I say it? It is necessary to teach them the necessary lesson.
My brothers,
Look, please do not cast your vote based solely on ethnic considerations. And I, as the representative of my Kurdish brothers, do not accept these. Because we built Şerafettin Elçi Airport in Şırnak despite their obstacles.
We built the airport in Ağrı despite their obstacles, we built Kars despite their obstacles, we built Iğdır despite their obstacles. Now Hakkari, we will open it in the coming weeks, with a delay of 2 years. They blocked me again,
They burned the machines and threatened the contractors, but thank God we are finishing it, we will also open Hakkari. Do we love the Kurds now or do they love them? Do we bring the service to them or do they take it? All this is obvious.
I encourage my brothers to put their heads in their hands and think. Please don't let fear guide your votes. I invite all our brothers from Van to spread fear. Voting is the honor and dignity of all of us,
Let's protect our honor and dignity.
They say that the solution process started while we were not in the Parliament. Yes, this process did not start with you, nor did it start for you, I tell them. This is a process that we initiated for our nation and that we carry out together with our nation, I
I started it. Hopefully, whether these happen or not, we will bring this process to an end together with our nation. Terrorism is the habit of the old Turkey, it was a valid method in the old Turkey, in the new Turkey neither terrorism nor those who do politics hiding behind terrorism
There will be no place. We will never allow those who want to build a future for themselves through the blood of my Kurdish brothers.
My brothers,
For us, the life of each of our 78 million citizens is sacred, valuable and important. We will not consent to anyone endangering the future of even a single brother of ours for the sake of their own ideological obsession. In their faces in Van
Those who wear different masks in Istanbul will not be of any use to this nation. We say the same thing everywhere, whatever we believe in for the future of our country and nation. What do we say? Rabia. What's wrong with Rabia? Are we ready? Let the whole of Türkiye hear it loudly. Only
nation, one flag, one homeland, one state.
Dear brothers and sisters,
We have walked so far with these 4 headings, and we will walk like this from now on.
Dear brothers and sisters,
What's in one nation? There are Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Abkhazians, all of them in one nation, this is one nation. We will give the necessary answer to those who want to divide.
My brothers,
Our flag is one. What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if anyone dies for it. My brothers, we will pay attention to this too, its color is the color of my martyr, the crescent is the expression of our independence, the star is the symbol of our martyr. to this flag
We will protect ourselves and hopefully look to the future together with confidence.
Here you see what is happening in our region, you see what is happening in the world. When we lose our unity, our unity, our brotherhood, believe me, it will be very bad. That's why they try to threaten you with your headmen, this and that.
Do not give bonuses to employees. This is our fight for honor, our fight for dignity, stand by those who serve you.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Follow those who run for you, those who love you, those who sweat for you. We love us for God's sake.
Happy day, may our openings be auspicious, may our future be bright.

Their Speech at the Rize Mass Opening Ceremony,2015-05-11,"



Dear Rize residents,
My dear fellow countrymen,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies, Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt affection. Dad, I am happy to be with you once again in my home town, Rize. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your appreciation, for your commitment to the covenant, for your sincere love and support. I would like to thank you once again for supporting this brother of yours, especially with the 81 percent support you gave in 81 provinces in the August 10 elections.
As you know, after the Presidential elections were over, I made my first visit to Trabzon and my second visit to Rize, and we expressed our gratitude to you. The previous weekend, on May 3, I had a good time in Istanbul at the Sinan Erdem Indoor Sports Hall with my fellow citizens from Rize, who came from all over our country. Today, I am in Rize to share with you the joy of the services that we will inaugurate with a mass opening ceremony.
I pray to God that the 26 different works worth 122 trillion liras, for which we held the mass opening ceremony, will be beneficial to our Rize and my fellow citizens of Rize. Although our Minister of National Education cut it very short, did not explain the works or anything, and blamed this task on me.
In education, today we are officially opening the Fındıklı Anatolian High School, Ömer Halaç Primary and Secondary School for the Hearing Impaired, and Rabia Hatun Anatolian Imam Hatip High School for Girls. With an investment of 20 trillion liras, our university brought a beautiful congress and cultural center and the School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Güneysu to our city.
Our Ministry of Youth and Sports has completed the construction of the Olympic swimming pool, indoor sports hall, Çayeli Youth Center and Rize Youth Center. We are holding the official openings of these sports and education investments here today.
Rize Training and Research Hospital indoor parking lot, Social Security Institution service building, İkizdere Government Mansion, Fırtına Valley Visitor Center, 68 disaster residences in Kaplıca District and 40 disaster residences in Ardeşen were completed. We are officially opening all these services here today.
Our Rize Municipality has completed deep sea discharge and sewerage construction, asphalt plant facility, water treatment facility, 4 parks, Barrier-Free Rize Project, sports facilities and landscaping and various drinking water works. We are officially opening these services here today.
I hope that all these works will be beneficial to our Rize and the people of Rize, and I would like to express my gratitude to our Government, our ministers and all the technocrats, bureaucrats and contractor companies who contributed to the bringing of all these works to our Rize.
My brothers,
Our trademark is service, but not like those in Pennsylvania. You know the beautiful saying of Ziya Pasha: ""The donkey dies and his saddle remains, the man dies and his work remains""; We will be remembered with our works, that is why we are on this path. Do you know how much we have invested in Rize in the past 12 years? Let me put it in old numbers so we can understand better, we invested 9 quadrillion.
We completed the Black Sea Coastal Road, which starts from Samsun and goes to Sarp, although it was 35 percent when we arrived. We crossed those so-called insurmountable mountains, we only pierced those tunnels and those mountains in between. We were in love with you, we were troubled, we were in love, thank God, we built a road by drilling those so-called impenetrable mountains and today we have minimized the risk of accidents.
Do you know how many divided roads there were in Rize in 2002? 20 kilometers. So what did we add to this? They built 20 kilometers of divided roads in 79 years, and we added 96 kilometers of divided roads in 12 years.
Thank God, the Ovit Tunnel is halfway through now, it continues, 14 kilometers of tunnel, 14 kilometers of tunnel. Now, as soon as the Ovit Tunnel is completed, will those mountains that are said to be insurmountable and Erzurum, which is said to be unvisitable in snow and winter, be opened? That's who we are. You see that some people are making talk, but we have also produced work, we are producing work; This is our difference.
We said that Rize should not have any shortcomings in terms of transportation, and we started working on the construction of an airport that Rize and Artvin will use together. Hopefully, when the airport is completed, my brother from Artvin will no longer have to go all the way to Trabzon. As you know, we are finishing a different airport in a beautiful place there between Ardeşen and Pazar. Likewise, my brother from Rize will go there, so we will shorten the journey.
Now you will calculate this: Is Trabzon Airport closer to me or this place? Accordingly, we will both cut down on fuel, save time, and thus experience the alternative conditions of a modern life in Turkey.
Do you know how much money was paid to our producers in Rize for the purchase of fresh tea in the past 12 years? It is 4.2 quadrillion liras. We increased the premium support for tea by 7 times, the support premium given to our producers is 1.3 quadrillion; from where to where.
Thank God, our university is developing and growing every year, the face of Rize has changed in every field and continues to change. As long as God gives us life and as long as God allows, we will continue to serve Rize and my fellow citizens of Rize.
Dear brothers and sisters,
When we came together with my fellow citizens from Rize in Istanbul, the Chairman of the Main Opposition Party was disturbed. He says that me coming together with my nation, my fellow citizens, and chatting with my nation harms democracy. A journalist with the same mentality had previously praised the Soviet Union period and insulted our nation, saying that democracy did not pass through the ballot box. He even went further and invited the Main Opposition and the party under the control of the terrorist organization to form an alliance and to fight, armed or unarmed, against what he saw as an outdated understanding. This journalist appeared on the Main Opposition's television recently and do you know what he said? “A woman who covers her head has given up her freedom.” My fellow citizens from Rize, you need to teach them the necessary lesson on June 7. Are you ready for this? Rize has always taught this lesson, but this time she must teach a completely different lesson. Wholesale, not retail, should teach a wholesale lesson.
No matter how hard they try, they cannot hide or suppress their hostility to the headscarf and belief. Of course, the ideal period of government in their minds is the single-party period under the leadership of the National Chief. You know, the one-party period when people even bought bread on ration cards, mosques were turned into warehouses and sold, and even the slightest voice of opposition was violently suppressed. What were some of their commissioned poets saying at that time? They said, ""The Kaaba belongs to the Arabs, Çankaya is enough for us."" You know these, right? Young people, do you know these?
Now someone has come out and is walking with the support of the terrorist organization behind him, and he says, ""The Kaaba of the workers is Taksim."" My Kurdish brothers are religious and have faith. But will you give the necessary lesson to the Muslim people of this country, the Muslim Kurdish children, and those who portray the Kaaba as Taksim on June 7? I am not worried about Rize anyway, that is a separate issue, but it is necessary to put them in their place altogether.
They have been disappointed after every election since 1950. The will of the nation at the ballot box is a nightmare for them, and that is where their hostility towards democracy comes from. In the past, the people were working and they were managing, but when the people had a say in the administration, they stopped talking. That's why they supported and applauded every coup, every junta, every tutelage attempt, and now they are applauding, I don't know where or why.
These were behind the coup of May 27, 1960. When they realized that they would not be able to achieve results at the ballot box despite the favor of the late Menderes from the nation, they handed over the matter to the junta members, and the blood of Menderes and his friends is still on their hands.
The system established by the May 27 Constitution lies at the basis of all political and social crises that Turkey has subsequently experienced. We know that behind this constitution is the administration of the single-party era, with its full staff of academics, bureaucrats and politicians. There was always the shadow of CHP behind the junta movements of the early 1970s. Usurping the power that cannot be obtained through democracy through threats is the classic management of this mentality.
As a matter of fact, in 1997, during the February 28 period, parties with the same mentality once again usurped power with the same method. Look, the Main Opposition Party has a female MP in Ankara, and at the top of the list, do you know who this candidate is? He is the biggest advocate of the oppression against our people's faith, especially our headscarved girls, during the February 28 period. You know, in 2008, we made a constitutional amendment to completely liberalize the headscarf in universities. You remember the day when the famous headline saying ""411 hands rose to chaos"" was made, right, young people? Now they are all in the same coalition. The Constitutional Court annulled this amendment, and they filed a closure case against the party of which I was the Chairman at the time. This candidate was also leading the secularism rallies held during this period. Later, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge, Turkey has left these bans behind, and now, thank God, the headscarf is allowed in universities, secondary education and the public sector. Whether they are bareheaded or covered, they are all my brothers, they are all citizens of this country. Why do you introduce discrimination among them, why do you sow the seeds of discrimination? Otherwise, there is no problem between veiled and uncovered, the problem is in these perverted mentalities, they are the problem.
What happened? These laws have been passed, has the apocalypse come to an end? Turkey did not enter a dark age as they expected, on the contrary, it is walking in a bright age. But their minds are dark, their mentality is dark. There are no roots in these, rootless, this is the problem. Today, there is a Turkey that has turned its direction to the future and is working towards its 2023 goals. But the Main Opposition Party is still longing for those days, and it shows this longing very clearly with the candidate it nominated first in Ankara, and it never leaves the seats of the representatives of February 28th vacant.
The place you will go with those who are enemies of the nation's values ​​is the Turkey of bans again. For them, democracy only means their own power and the dominance of their own ideology in freedoms. Their names are social democrats, but they are fascists. Their fights are with this nation's history, their troubles are with this nation's culture and faith. Be careful, they say nothing about the values ​​of our nation, when it comes to words they say they are respectful, but they do not hesitate to attack the values ​​of our nation at every opportunity.
Here comes someone, what does he say? He says it is very important, we will close the middle part of the imam hatip schools. Who says this? CHP. But it also camouflages it like this: 1+8+4. Mr. President of the Main Opposition, we have seen this game before, we have seen this scenario before, you cannot make us swallow these anymore. A Muslim will never be stung again through the same hole he was put in. That's over. Look, they closed the middle sections and the number of students, which was 600 thousand, suddenly dropped to 60 thousand. Now it has opened, coefficients have been lifted, quotas have been lifted, imam hatip and vocational high schools are going to the university they want, what is the number of students now? It rose to 1 million. Now they are disturbed by this.
I have pain, I have problems, I am a father, I have 2 girls, 2 boys, 4 children, all 4 of them went to Imam Hatip, but my daughters were turned away at the door. Unfortunately, they could not go to university in my own country, I had to send them abroad. They could go and study in America and England wearing a headscarf, but they could not study here, they said, 'You are a stranger in your own country, a pariah in your own country'.
My son couldn't study either, unfortunately he was stuck with the coefficient even though he had a high score. He also went abroad, received his undergraduate education in America, and then completed his master's degree at Harvard. Why? They are jealous, they are jealous, that's the point. Now to overcome these... How can a religious student study at Harvard? He just reads, he reads like honey, that's what they can't digest.
Now all obstacles have been overcome, they are being overcome, better days will come. A youth is coming who is morally strong, has historical awareness and hopefully is very advanced in science, art and culture, but they cannot digest this. But they are hostile to mosques, hostile to religious officials, hostile to Quran education, and do not refrain from being hostile to the headscarf at every opportunity. At this point, the political party behind the terrorist organization is stuck with the Presidency of Religious Affairs. What do they say? He says we will abolish the Diyanet, look at these, we will abolish the Diyanet. What happened to you from Diyanet, what did Diyanet do to you?
My brothers,
Source, you know, they promise, we will fix the economy like this, we will fix it like this, do you know what one of the sources is? Our President of Religious Affairs opposes all these news and says, ""I asked for that Mercedes car to be sold"" and makes it sold. However, if I had the knowledge, if I had the knowledge, I would say, Mehmet teacher, what are you doing, why are you selling that Mercedes, what does it have to do with it? What is the price of that Mercedes you are going to drive? What do you think about the news and headlines published by the newspapers?
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Look, it's very interesting, one of the sources says, 'We found 1 million'. These are clowns, they are in no position to manage the economy or anything, they cannot manage the municipalities they currently have, the municipalities. The places where the municipalities are under their control are full of filth, abuse is rampant, wander around the back streets and there are garbage dumps. As the Mayor, when I took over Istanbul, I see what Istanbul is like, mountains of garbage. Here's what they put on billboards in Van. Yes, a Van with blood flowing from its taps. Does blood flow from the tap? It flows and flows from their taps. I know that muddy water, mud water and mossy water flow from the taps, but I have never seen blood flowing from these taps.
Now, we, as Turkey, need to teach them the necessary lesson, including my Kurdish brothers, on June 7. We need peace, we need brotherhood. No one can break our peace and brotherhood. That's why, my dear brothers, look, he is nominating the mufti in the region, right? But what does the mufti say? He says it's me, look, this is also very interesting, my party, there is a certain religion that has these fires, he says if it were that, I would be a candidate from here. Look at this situation, what a misfortune, what a misfortune for yourself.
In the West, without Ali, they nominate the representative of those who are trying to turn Alevism into a separate religion under the name of Alevism. They do not even hide that they want to replace the values ​​and beliefs of our Kurdish brothers with a marginal ideology, and the parallel organization provides logistical support to them, you know, from the back door of Diyarbakır Municipality. it is entering. Who held hands with whom?
If I'm not mistaken, it was Akif's, he said 'he who curses my religion should at least be a Muslim', we are at such a point. In fact, this game is not new, it has been repeated for 200 years. Our nation taught them a lesson every time; They gave in 1950, they gave after May 27, they gave after September 12, they gave after February 28, they gave after December 17-25, but you see, they cannot give up. Our nation's answer to these questions is already present in our National Anthem:
“The purpose of my soul from you, divine, is this:
Don't let your anonymous hand touch the chest of my temple.
These adhans, whose testimonies are the basis of religion,
Eternal homeland on my groaning.""
Yes, the call to prayer will continue to echo in the skies of our country, and faces and hearts will continue to turn to the Kaaba five times a day. Our nation, with its Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Laz, Circassians, Roma, Bosnians and all its colors, will continue to protect its history, culture and beliefs. This nation has successfully passed this test every time, hopefully this time it will choose its unity, solidarity and brotherhood.
We will be one, we will be together, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be Turkey all together.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
The June 7 elections are also an important turning point on the road to the construction of a new Turkey. Turkey has suffered greatly from the crisis, chaos, strife and fighting. There are those of you who remember the 70s and 90s, but there are those who do not. Young people do not know those times, please tell the young people about those years, tell about what you went through in schools, tell about what you went through in hospitals, tell about the suffering you went through on the roads. Even if this Mount Armelit could speak, there are people who remember what we went through, what we went through on those bends, what we went through with those buses with noses, but young people wouldn't remember, right? How long did it take to go from here to Istanbul, but how long does it take now? Where did we come from?
Everyone is a millionaire... Do you know what they would say when asked who is rich? Millionaire. But they brought us to such a point that we had to go to the toilet for 1 million. You've seen those days, right? 1 million. Why? We went to bed in the evening and woke up in the morning, 1 zero. They put 6 zeros next to 1. What did we say? I told my friends, we will throw 6 zeros. Dear Prime Minister, they said 'no way'. We will throw it. I said what will happen, if we throw it away, this is what will happen; We will throw and we scored 6 zeros. And our money has come somewhere against the dollar. It is very interesting that one of the columnists of that time is now listening to us on that TV, but he may have turned it off because he was bored. Do you know what he said? “If they remove the six zeros, I will bray like a donkey in Taksim Square,” she said. I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
They said 'inflation would explode', they said 'it would crash', but nothing happened. On the contrary, we bought it at 30 percent. As you know, there were days when inflation in this country reached 330 percent. Now it's in single digits.
Over the past 12 years, we have achieved an environment of trust and stability thanks to our nation's trust in us. Brothers and sisters, there are better days, better steps are coming. We will continue these successfully. Because Türkiye has come to this day with trust and stability. Hopefully, we will continue our journey with the same trust and stability. For this reason, let's join hands and build the new Turkey together.
We need a new constitution and presidential system for the construction of the new Turkey. The way to create an environment of trust and stability in Turkey in a way that no one can disrupt again is through changing the system. These discussions, these searches are not unique to us. The same process is happening all over the world. Look, a law was passed in Italy banning coalitions, 40 percent of the votes are taken if you get it alone, if you don't get it, there is a second round. The person who gets the most votes in the second round becomes the sole government. Likewise, England struggled to find a solution to the representation and stability problem that emerged after the last elections. And look, three party leaders resigned within an hour because they lost the elections. Could our people do it? Remember what I was always saying, do you remember that I was saying that if my party did not come first, if we did not come out first in the elections, I would submit my resignation the next day? But what was I saying to the others; I was wondering if you were ready to resign too. Have you ever heard that they can also resign? Now Mr. Prime Minister says the same thing, he says; I am ready to resign, others say they are ready to resign. There is honesty in politics, there is honor in politics. The West shows this, why can't you?
Yesterday I was in Germany and Belgium. I met with our citizens in Germany, I met with my citizens in Belgium. The same problem exists there too. See, they could not form a government for 141 days due to the coalition government. In the previous election, they could not form a government for 540 days, the same thing happened in Sweden.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Look, all of this is a lesson to us, but we need to see it. These countries, all governed by a parliamentary system, are looking for ways out. On the other hand, we look at the fact that 10 important countries in the G-20, where we hold the Term Presidency, are governed by the presidential system. As you know, in the presidential system, the executive power is completely free from the tutelage of the bureaucracy and is largely free from political obstacles in the Parliament. The person elected as the head of state is obliged to implement the program he presented to the nation until the end of his term of office. The president's term of office is 4 years, and for 5 years things are going smoothly without the threat of political crisis.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
All aside, I would like to share one thing with you here in particular, and that is: We need to build the New Turkey together, we need to be ready for this. Of course, I would like to specifically ask this to my fellow citizens from Rize: We took the duty from the nation, and hopefully we will give the account to the nation.
Is Rize ready to establish the new Turkey? Is Rize ready to establish the new constitution? Is Rize ready for the presidential system? Mashallah, barakallah.
May God not destroy our unity and solidarity, and in the meantime, hopefully the tender for the Salarha Tunnel will be held on May 26. We hope to connect the Salarha Tunnel to the Southern Ring Road. By rehabilitating Hamam Creek, we are connecting the ring road to the coast with a double road on its right and left. A modern boulevard opens from Yeni Orta Mosque to Dosma. I hope the first stage of the Southern Ring Road is being completed quickly. Project work for the second stage, the section between Pehlivantaşı and Alipaşa, has started and this is also continuing.
Dear brothers and sisters,
With all this, let's shout something together as a sign of our unity, solidarity and brotherhood, and I want Turkey to hear it too. Look, we built Marmaray in Istanbul, right? Not a penny came out of the people's pocket. 18 months have passed, do you know how many people passed through Marmaray in 18 months? Thank God, young people follow us well. Yes, 73 million of our citizens passed through Marmaray. Because we are the children of Fatih. Fatih moved the ships by land. As his children, we built Marmaray under the sea. Now we are building the Eurasia Tunnel. We said it wasn't enough, we don't just have to have a rail system, we also have to take care of the cars passing under the sea. It is a two-layer tunnel, cars will pass through it, and we will complete it next year. And now, hopefully, the project under the third sea is ready and its steps will be taken. But in the meantime, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge is moving. As you know, there are three golden necklaces on the Bosphorus, the third one is the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge. It is currently ongoing with efforts to complete it by the end of the year. Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge is the widest bridge in the world; There will be 4 departures and 4 arrivals, and a high-speed train will run in the middle, leaving and coming.
My brothers,
This is us. Thank God, I am not talking to you about these things, these are the things we have done, our ongoing constructions, I am telling you about these. But you see what others are saying, so let's be careful. And now we also have the Istanbul-Izmir Highway. Once this is done it will be down to 3.5 hours. The bridge on it is one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. It continues rapidly, the towers are finished, now the ropes are being installed. My brothers, we produce services, they produce words.
But I will tell you something; As you know, I am equally distant from all parties, I am the President. But of course, there is a lion in my heart, that is a separate issue, a separate issue. Now some chairmen have come out and say; The President must be impartial. No, what did I say before the Presidential election? I said I am on my side. But where is my side? I am on the side of the nation, on the side of the nation, on the side of the nation. Now they get up and complain, they go to the Supreme Electoral Council, they say; 'The President should not go to the squares'. This nation voted for me to come to these squares. How can you deprive me of going to these squares? How dare you ban this from a President who was born among this nation? They don't read the Constitution either. According to the Constitution, the president has no crime other than treason, and they do not know that. And none of them can take away this right of mine. As you know, when we set out on this journey, we put on our shrouds and walked like that. We will continue our journey to serve this nation.
Are we ready? Let's see the flags. One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state. We are one nation; Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Laz, Circassians, Georgians, Bosnians, you name it, all of these are included in the concept of nation.
Two; single flag. ""What makes a flag a flag is the blood on it, the land is a homeland if anyone dies for it."" This is our flag. But some people are looking for a separate flag for themselves. I am calling out to my Kurdish brothers; I say, don't fall for this game, spoil this game. In this country, we have a flag that took its color with the blood of martyrs, we have a flag that defines our independence with its crescent, and we have a flag that expresses our martyrs with its stars. Isn't this enough for us? This is our unity, this is our togetherness.
And here is our homeland, one homeland, with 780 thousand square kilometers, no one can divide this country of ours, we will not let it be divided. God will find us first. As a state, especially as the President, our Government, our state, our army, and all our security forces, we will be against them.
And one state. There is no state within the state. Here is a parallel that emerged. And, as you know, we made the decision at the National Security Council; We made our decision regarding illegal terrorist organizations disguised as legal, one of which is a parallel state structure, from the National Security Council. Our institutions are currently doing all of these necessary things and will continue to do so.
My brothers, I say; non-stop. According to him, there are only weeks and days left. Be sure to exercise your democratic right on June 7. Don't be negligent, you have to blow up the ballot boxes, you have to use this democratic right of yours. Call all your friends and acquaintances wherever you are, talk to them, commiserate with them and hopefully crown the struggle for democracy on June 7.
I love you for God's sake. We have always been in love with you, and we have seen it in return, so we pray, may God help us.
To the people of Rize, to all our young people, to my sisters, yesterday was Mother's Day, mothers whose feet should be kissed, we have come this far with you. You have become our reason for existence. Woe to the one who makes his parents say ""uff"". That's why mothers, you should know that our love for you is different. Because I know mother's pain, I know father's pain. Yesterday was a different day for him too. May God have mercy on all mothers who have passed away. Yesterday, we sent our Fatihas from Germany and Belgium to those mothers.
God help us and get half.
Once again, we wish all the works to be beneficial, in the name of Allah.

11th President of the Republic of Türkiye,
Dear Brother Abdullah Gül,
Dear Heads of State,
Presidents,
Speakers of Parliament and Prime Ministers,
Dear Ministers,
Distinguished Guests from home and abroad who attended this meaningful ceremony,
Dear Citizens of the Republic of Türkiye,
Ladies,
Gentlemen,
I greet you with my most heartfelt feelings and welcome all our guests who shared this meaningful day and this excitement with us today, especially the Heads of State, Emir, President, Speaker of the Assembly, Prime Minister, Minister and Parliamentarians from friendly and brotherly countries, and I say, you have honored us.
First of all, I would like to express my endless gratitude to my beloved nation who watched us on their screens in the first hours of my inauguration as the 12th President of the Republic of Turkey.
For the first time in our 91-year history of the republic, and I can even say in 2000 years of Turkish history, the head of state was determined by our nation going to the polls and making a choice, that is, a President directly by their own choice.
I would especially like to express that in these first hours, when I felt the happiness of being the 12th President of the Republic of Turkey, I also felt the pride of being the first President elected by the votes of the people. Of course, I am aware that my responsibility has increased much more on this occasion.
I would like to thank my nation, who voted yes to the constitutional amendment in 2007 with 69% of the votes, and who entrusted me with this sacred duty by voting with 52% in the first round on August 10, and I would like to emphasize that I will firmly protect their trust as long as I breathe.
Again today, I would like to express my gratitude to the 11th President of the Republic of Turkey, my Valuable Cause Friend, on behalf of myself, my family, my country and my nation, for this sacred duty that he has successfully carried out for 7 years.
Me as the Prime Minister and Mr. Gül as the President, we have provided great services and works to Turkey in harmony and coordination for 7 years. As they have just stated, as companions on a very long walk, this point that we have come to with the responsibility of being together for 40 years - not an easy time - I believe is a point where we can crown this with works. It is within this understanding that great services and works have been brought to Turkey. I would especially like to state that, as companions on a very long walk, I would like to benefit from Mr. Abdullah Gül's experience and ideas from now on. I thank him once again. I wish the family happiness and success in their future endeavors.
Very valuable guests,
My Dear Nation,
As the Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey for 12 years, we strengthened the national will and expanded the field of politics with our government and party; We have carried out major reforms to strengthen the standards of democracy, human rights and freedoms. Each historical reform opened the doors to a new reform. Every change we made paved the way for bigger changes.
The direct election of the president by the people is not just a technical change, but actually a matter of ending an era. The period that ends today is the period of old Türkiye. The new era, whose doors have opened wide, is the period of the new Turkey, the Great Turkey, which carries the essence and spirit of the first years of our republic. There were gangs and tutelage in old Turkey. There were obstacles and threats to politics in old Turkey. There was instability, suspicion and hesitation in old Turkey. Thank God, we have left these problems behind with each reform we have implemented step by step and patiently. With the election of the latest President by the people, we have declared to the world the absolute victory of national will and democracy. From today onwards, Turkey will focus on its 2023 goals, which is the 100th anniversary of the founding of our republic, without wasting time on old debates, without wasting its energy, and without allowing polarization and polarization.
The elected president and the elected government will work together in harmony and grow the economy faster and healthier.
Social welfare will be increased, and I believe that by seeing the differences of all members of the society as a wealth, fraternal meetings on common grounds will be ensured.
Turkey's march towards its strategic goal of European Union membership will continue more determinedly.
Our democratic reforms will not slow down, and the unity and integrity of 77 million will be established more strongly through all means, especially the solution process.
I would like to express this in particular in front of the very valuable representatives of friendly and brotherly countries: The main axis of Turkey's foreign policy is peace, solidarity and prosperity. Turkey has no interest in any country's territory or internal affairs; There is no plan or project. We desire peace, sharing and prosperity to prevail in every inch of the world, especially with our neighbors and in the Middle East, and we shape our foreign policy in this direction.
In accordance with the mission assigned to us by history and geography, we see standing against injustice and oppression as the main axis of our foreign policy.
The reason why we support the Palestinian cause so strongly is that those who died were human beings. In the Syrian issue, the reason why we have welcomed one million 200 thousand people is, first of all, that they are human beings. We cannot and cannot remain silent in Syria, where more than 200 thousand people have now been killed. And we regard this as a humanitarian and conscientious problem, and we place it at the center of politics in terms of political responsibility. We raise our voices in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and all other areas of conflict and crisis as a result of the value we attach to people and life. For us, there are people and lives beyond ethnic origins, languages, skin colors, oil, diamonds, gold, energy resources.
We strive to glorify our friendship with every country that is friendly to us. It is our duty as humanity to warn those who are enemies of us or their own people, that is, humans. No one should ever accept this as interfering in internal affairs. I think it is the duty of every human being to warn those who are hostile to us or to their own people, that is, to humans.
In the coming period, our foreign policy will continue more actively and effectively, focusing on people and conscience.
Dear Valued Guests,
My Dear Citizens,
The Republic of Turkey was established on October 29, 1923, and on the same day, the Turkish Grand National Assembly elected Gazi Mustafa Kemal as the first President. Gazi Mustafa Kemal completed his speech in the Parliament immediately after his election with the following statements:
“We will move forward together, always considering the trust of the nation as our basis. The Republic of Türkiye will be happy, successful and victorious.” These words of the veteran were applauded for a long time. Bozok, that is, Yozgat deputy of the period, Avni Bey, suggested ""a prayer should be made"" in the general assembly, and a prayer was made by Karahisar Deputy Kamil Efendi on the occasion of the election of the first President. Yes, as our first President, Gazi Mustafa Kemal, stated, the favor of the nation will always be our basis.
Our future struggle, which has been going on for 91 years and will continue unabated and with new gains, will never be interrupted. Turkey's blessed march dating back centuries will hopefully continue towards the future on the axis of justice, peace and solidarity.
In these first minutes of the new Turkey and a new beginning, I pray to God for blessings for our country, our nation and all humanity. I pray that peace will prevail in the world.
In this meaningful ceremony, I remember all our martyrs and veterans with respect and gratitude. I would like to thank our guests again and again for their participation, and I would also like to express my gratitude to our beloved nation.
Of course, we have a song with our 11th President; “We walked these roads together” We walked these roads together, regardless of rain, snow or winter. And hopefully, now we will walk this path together again, on the path to the construction and revival of the new Turkey. I pray that God will guide us, may God help us, may God not put us to shame, and I greet you all with love and respect.
