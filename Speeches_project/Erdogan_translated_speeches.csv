I greet you all with affection, assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi and blessings.
I am very fortunate to be together with you today on the occasion of your Gulf Cooperation Summit.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank my dear brother Sheikh Tamim for inviting me to the summit as the guest of honor.
Our relations with the Gulf countries are developing day by day. My presence here with you today is a manifestation of our will to further our relations. Hopefully, I believe that we will strengthen our relations by acting in unity of hand and heart.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Our trade volume with the Gulf countries has increased 13 times in the last 20 years and reached 23 billion dollars as of last year. The resumption of the free trade agreement negotiations of the Turkey Gulf Cooperation Council and the entry into force of the agreement in a short time will further increase our trade.
It is a source of happiness for us that Turkey is one of the most preferred countries for our brothers and sisters in the Gulf countries for their touristic trips.
The Ministerial Mechanism for Strategic Dialogue, which is the main element of our relations with the Council, has held 5 meetings so far. Hopefully, we will host the 6th of the meetings organized with the participation of our Foreign Ministers in the first quarter of 2024.
We attach great importance to transportation projects that connect the Gulf region to Europe by land through our country. We believe that these projects should be crowned with energy collaborations.
Turkey remains a safe haven for international investors. I would like to express that we are ready to provide all kinds of support to our brothers and sisters who trust the Turkish economy.
Thanks to our brothers in the Gulf, we have achieved a very different momentum in the field of defense industry. Recent events have revealed how important and strategic our cooperation in this field is. I think it would be beneficial for us to diversify our cooperation in the defense industry, including joint production and financing.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
With the Extraordinary Joint Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League in Riyadh, we clearly demonstrated our solidarity with the Palestinian people. This common stance on the Gaza crisis has also set an example for the countries of the region to embrace our problems. It is important that we follow up on the decisions taken at the summit. The Contact Group of Foreign Ministers has held meetings in various countries and will continue these contacts.
We commend Qatar's efforts to achieve a short-term temporary humanitarian pause in Gaza and a prisoner exchange. Of course, we hoped that this chapter would turn into a permanent ceasefire, but this did not happen. The Netanyahu administration is endangering the security and future of our entire region for the sake of prolonging its political life. The loss of the lives of 17,000 innocent Palestinians, mostly children and women, is a crime against humanity, a war crime. Israel should not get away with these crimes.
As Turkey, we continue to increase our humanitarian aid to the region. So far, we have dispatched 12 planes and 2 civilian ships full of aid materials to El Arish. We ensured the transfer of the injured, especially cancer patients and children, to Turkey. Our priority is the immediate declaration of a permanent ceasefire and the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid.
With the latest developments, the importance of the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital on the basis of the 1967 borders has once again been seen. For this purpose, we have declared that we are ready to take responsibility together with the countries of the region, including as guarantors.
We must not allow the atrocities in Gaza to lead to a regional war involving Syria. The biggest obstacle to the stabilization of Syria is the separatist terrorist elements, especially the PKK, PYD, YPG, which threaten the territorial integrity and unity of Syria. We expect all our brothers and sisters to be vigilant against the efforts of these terrorist organizations to legitimize themselves. We aim for a political solution to the Syrian conflict on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2,254. It is also necessary to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary and safe return of Syrians; We invite all actors to cooperate in this direction.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We welcome the efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council to strengthen its institutional structure. I believe that carrying out this deepening simultaneously with the enlargement will open different horizons for the Council. I would like to reiterate our readiness to advance our close contact and strategic cooperation with the Gulf region on the basis of many interests and mutual respect.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the summit, especially our Qatari brothers.
I pray that God will make our solidarity permanent.
I hope that our meetings will be beneficial.

Dear Executives and Members of the National Turkish Student Union,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. 62nd anniversary of our Union. I pray to God that the General Assembly will be instrumental in good deeds.
I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has been struggling, taking part and serving under the roof of our National Turkish Student Union since its establishment. I would like to thank each and every one of our brothers and sisters who continue the same blessed struggle today. I wish success to my brothers and sisters who will take over the flag of service in our General Assembly.
As it is known, the establishment of the National Turkish Student Union dates back to 1916. Our Union, which continued its activities after the proclamation of the Republic, was closed in 1936 due to the action it took in the most heated days of the Hatay issue. Until 1965, the National Turkish Student Union, which started its activities again after about 10 years, was almost bizarre in the hands of an administration that did not fit its name and the mission it represented. Our Union, which later turned to a national line that was expressed in its name again, was buried under the rubble of the September 12 coup d'Ã©tat, like many similar non-governmental organizations. With the persistent follow-up of our elders and young people, whose hearts beat with the love of serving their country and the nation, our Association officially started its activities again in 2008.
With its history of nearly 107 years, the National Turkish Student Union continues to be a bridge built from the past to the future in front of the youth of our country. Starting from the period of the Gallipoli War and extending to the national struggle and various phases of the Republic, our Union has always been the defender of our nation's values under attack. It is possible to see examples of this in a wide range from Turkish sensitivity to opposing the destruction of Turkish graves in Bulgaria, from insisting on Hatay to joining the motherland to fighting the Soviet threat, from embracing the Cyprus issue to the developments in East Turkestan and Kirkuk, from the case of reopening Hagia Sophia to worship and the vision of a great Turkey.
In our youth, we participated in many activities under this roof and took part in many cultural and artistic programs. Fakir also worked as the Director of Facilities and the Director of Culture. And of course, there was an election here in connection with the jubilee of our master; Of course, these seats do not exist at that time, wooden seats, this is of course the stage and 2 friends made it to the finals. A friend of mine prepared an introduction of a master who was very long in his own way, and I prepared an introduction that was half the size of an A4. Of course, some of our master's statements were very harsh, and he did not make my other friend do it, but gave the task to the poor. We are doing the jubilee at the Sports Exhibition Center, that is, there was the Sports Exhibition Center in the place of that hall in today's Harbiye, it was the largest sports hall in Istanbul, we are doing it there and the stands collapsed, a magnificent participation. And we continued the jubilee adventure of our master, which started there, in Izmir and Ankara. Of course, such a process is the end of the word.
Now we are always talking about Hagia Sophia, we are in front of the water level in Hagia Sophia in Sultanahmet, the speakers are there, the rally is in the square, of course, it is huge, and as it was just said in the rally in that square, our master lit the flare from that day by saying that Hagia Sophia will be opened there, Hagia Sophia will be opened, and how it will be opened, and alhamdulillah, we were also blessed to open Hagia Sophia.
The most important feature of the National Turkish Demand Union is that it has succeeded in embracing all the nationalist and holy youth in our country. Although the weight of different schools has been felt in some turns, we see that the Union has taken care to maintain this quality in general. Today, our expectation from our Union is that our young people will continue to exhibit the same encompassing attitude in this period when they are under intense global bombardment politically, socially, culturally and technologically.
To all the young people who are in front of me right now, in the gym, my request, my request, oh, never lose this embracing quality. We will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey together.
If we cannot prepare our young people, who are the owners and guarantees of our future, for the world with a strong historical and cultural equipment, we will make our job difficult. Right now, we are following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict together in the world, we are seeing what is happening together. Are Muslims worthy of this? Not. But we have mistakes and shortcomings. Look, the whole Western world is a crusader imperialist structure, they are not separate from each other. Unfortunately, I saw this in my visit last night, I saw this in the President, and I saw this in the other one. They go to bed and wake up, Hamas is Hamas, Hamas is Hamas. They say that Hamas' outburst on Oct. 7 sparked this situation.
Of course, I told them: 13,000 children, women and the elderly have been killed by Israel, why don't you talk about it? Here are the hostages; Okay, what about the hostages held by Israel? Nearly 10,000 Israelis are currently holding hostages. Come on, as Germany, you take the step of giving them away, and we will try to take what Hamas currently has, are you ready for this? They can't say yes. Your President, who will go to Israel in a week, take this step, let's take the opposite step, otherwise this will not happen. We will stand tall no matter what, we cannot compromise on this.
A mass that has no ideal other than pursuing an individual career cannot be the youth to whom we can entrust our future. Hopefully, a youth that acts in unity, solidarity, faith, courage and stability, thinks about the issues of its country and nation, and stands out with its intellectual and physical competence will show itself under this roof.
It is also our duty to do our part to raise a youth with the council that the master, one of the symbolic names of our unity, expresses as ""time belongs to me and the place is entrusted to me"".
As we always say, we are here as the guests of our elders, our generation and even the next generation, our young people, we are here, we are guests right now, the real owners are here, so we have a lot of expectations from you.
Hopefully, our elders inside, both brother Ismail and other elders, have just made a request that we demolish this place and build a new National Turkish Student Union in its place. And at the moment, in order for such a step to be taken, especially our Fatih Mayor, I hope that my brothers and sisters, who have bulging pockets in a short time, should take this step by supporting this work. Our duty is to establish the infrastructure and provide our young people with the necessary infrastructure and opportunities for the construction of a great, strong and prosperous Turkey, which we call the Turkish century. In other words, the construction of a physical structure here will really be a step that suits the ideals of this institution. Only in this way can we ensure that our thousand-year-old existence in our homeland and our thousand-year-old civilization heritage can continue for thousands of years, by Allah's leave.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We rule in a geography that embodies the oldest heritage of humanity. Being the owner of this great and glorious heritage also requires facing many problems, troubles and crises. As you have followed, our country is surrounded by a ring of fire. Turkey continues on its way with the aim of becoming one of the most advanced countries in the world in all political, economic, military, cultural and social fields in this ring of fire. But let's not forget this: The Crusader-Crescent understanding is not over, it continues.
Those who light this ring of fire and constantly fan it have only one goal, and that is to prevent Turkey, the locomotive country of the Turkish and Islamic world, from achieving its goals, but we will not allow it.
There should be no doubt that behind every activity that takes place in and around our borders that has consequences against our country, there is an intention to uproot our nation from these lands. Of course, when we say these lands, we mean our geography of hearts in a broad sense. Anyone who still does not want to accept that Turkey is not just a country with its own borders is either ignorant or a traitor whose head and heart have been rented to other groups.
Therefore, we need to look at our cycle with the horizon of our hearts and evaluate the events accordingly. This is the case with Syria, this is the case with Iraq, this is the case with Cyprus, this is the case with every issue in the Caucasus, this is the case with everything in the Balkans, this is the case with everything in South Asia. This is the case with every issue that starts from the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean and goes down to the depths of Africa. In fact, with our 7 million citizens living scattered in various countries, every issue in Europe is like this for us. And of course, this is also the case with what is happening in Gaza and the issue of Jerusalem. Whoever says what to us from Syria, what to us from Iraq, what to us from Karabakh, what to us from Libya, what to us from Bosnia, what to us from Jerusalem is actually tripping up the great march of Turkey, knowingly or unknowingly.
One scientist says, ""Never confuse education with intelligence, you can get a doctorate and still be an ignoramus."" It is a fact that there are quite a few educated ignorant people in our country. Our greatest assurance against this is that our nation is able to comprehend the issues of the country and the world in a deep way with its deep-rooted wisdom. Every attempt, every scenario, every trap, every trick that wants to divert Turkey from its course has eventually hit the wall of faith and courage of our nation and failed. What does the poet say: ""Faith is the gem that is great, and the rusty heart that has no faith is a burden on the soul.""
Every attack we have been exposed to has always had a cost. The fact that we were able to keep our country on the route of a great and strong Turkey, albeit with difficulty, provided us with the opportunity to compensate for our losses. We have been fighting for this since March 1994 in Istanbul and November 2002 throughout the country. We have not only replaced the losses and deprivations that our nation has experienced for more than 2 centuries. In addition, we have directed our country to much bigger goals with the vision of 2023 and then the Turkish century. Praise be to God, our nation has always stood by us and supported us in this struggle.
As Turkey grew stronger and asserted its claim in every field, the magnitude of the hostilities it attracted increased. Supposedly, we were faced with secret or open blockades of countries with which we were in the same alliances and parties to the same agreements. This is the reason for the political, economic, diplomatic and military obstacles that have come our way, especially in the last 10 years. There are also extensions of them inside. Whatever we have done so far, whatever project we have implemented, whatever progress we have made, we have achieved them despite these external and internal saboteurs. Thus, we have raised the foundations of a great and strong Turkey, which we see as the most important legacy we will leave to our youth. I have no doubt that our young people will raise our country and our nation to the level it deserves in the world on this basis.
Brothers
Turkey must be strong. The most obvious proof of this is the humanitarian crises and conflicts that have taken place in our immediate vicinity in recent years. Syria is in shambles, Iraq is fragile, Libya has still not restored its unity, the war on Ukrainian soil continues, the tension in the Balkans never decreases. Israel has become a provocation to every state in the region, and that is its power. Europe and America do not care about anything except their own security and prosperity. Unfortunately, Islamic countries cannot take a strong stance even on the most basic issues such as the Jerusalem issue. Although the Organization of Turkic States is getting stronger, it has not yet reached the level we desire. In all this picture, Turkey is struggling, striving and working to ensure unity, solidarity and solidarity in every field and in every subject.
Praise be to Allah, the result achieved in Karabakh has shown us what kind of consequences can be achieved by acting in unity and solidarity. I regret to say that we have not yet been able to form such a unity of forces on the Gaza issue. If today Israel is able to brutally kill people in Gaza and other Palestinian cities, and even in neighboring countries, it is not because of its power, but because of the disunity of the Islamic world. While the governments of Western countries are almost captive to Israel, the awakening of the peoples of the same countries and the rising objections give us hope for humanity. You see the state of the streets in England, you see it in France, you see it in America, you see it yesterday in Berlin; That is to say, another awakening is manifested with the name of Ya Kahhar.
Israel's state and occupying terror in Gaza and other Palestinian cities is a crime against humanity, a genocide. At the moment, with more than 2 thousand lawyers, I hope we will complain about this genocide to the necessary places, we will follow it, we cannot leave this work in the lurch. And this price will be paid, but unfortunately in our Parliament, you see that the leader of a political party speaks exactly like Netanyahu. Now we are the ones who will answer them. What are we going to give it with? We will give with our stance, we will give our place. Because there cannot and should not be people who speak like Netanyahu under the roof of this Parliament.
I say, and I said it yesterday, Israel is a terrorist state. And unfortunately, the person who is at the head of this terror state has made Israel revolt against the people of Israel and make them rebel against him, so the end is near.
It is imperative that this crime is pursued and investigated at the international level and that the wrongdoers receive the punishments they deserve, otherwise no individual, no society in the world can feel safe. If any terrorist organization backed by powers such as America and Europe will slaughter people as they wish and commit atrocities amounting to genocide, it means that the world order has completely deteriorated. Like any corrupt order, it is inevitable that this order will change. We are striving to do our part by expressing these truths, bringing the demand for change to the world agenda and sharing it with the representatives of every country we meet. We show our stance against oppression by expressing it with our tongue and correcting it with our hands, as well as by expressing it with our hearts. But if we can't do any of that, then what are we going to do together? We will refer it to our Lord.
The humanitarian aid we sent to Gaza via Egypt and the wounded we brought to our country from Gaza are an expression of this effort. At the moment, we have received 27 cancer patients, including their companions, and we are in an effort to get those who need surgical intervention as soon as possible, and our negotiations with Egypt are currently continuing in this direction. And as you know, we have sent our humanitarian aid with 666 tons of ships, as well as 10 planeloads of our aid.
Hopefully, the atrocities in Gaza and the sacrifices of more than 12,000 of our brothers and sisters who were martyred there will lead to a new awakening and a new shake-up in the world. By Allah's leave, not a single drop of blood or tears shed in Gaza will be wasted. Hopefully, we will witness once again the miracle of our Lord's warning that there may be no in those who seem evil to you, and evil in those who seem no.
I believe that our National Turkish Student Union will be the standard-bearer of this uplift, this awakening, this revival and this revolution in the eyes of our youth, as it has always been throughout its history.
With these feelings, I once again commemorate with gratitude everyone who has contributed to our Union since its establishment, and I hope that our General Assembly will be instrumental in good deeds.
I greet you all with love and respect.
Stay healthy.

Dear Brothers and Sisters in the Parents' Home,
I especially congratulate the Red Crescent, God willing, help us.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I am happy to be together with you after a long time in the parents' home, may God help us. I congratulate you as the youth of GÃ¼neysu and I wish God to increase your efforts. Of course, it's been a long time since the election, the last time I came was in the election, we couldn't come after the election. Of course, we said let's start with the provinces where we received the most votes in the programs throughout Turkey, we started from Bayburt, GÃ¼mÃ¼Åhane and now we are in my hometown of Rize.
Of course, we have a lot of things to do, there are many things we are doing. And we will join hands together, from education to health, justice, hopefully, transportation, with all these, we will hopefully move Turkey to a much different place. We are here tomorrow to hold mass openings. We will hold mass openings and I wanted to see the urban transformation in Rize on site. I wanted to see the transformations in Ayder on site. Hopefully, we will see all these on the spot and take our steps. At this point, as you know, there are local elections and municipal elections 5-6 months later. In the local elections, I hope you will go from house to house, especially in Rize Center, and hopefully bring our districts to our party. As you know, we experienced a decrease in the number of deputies in the last elections. We probably won't have the same decline in the local elections. This will require a very different kind of effort. With these efforts, I hope we will make a very strong voice from Rize and its districts. Are we ready for this?
And tomorrow, hopefully, we wanted to see them somewhere in the center of urban transformation Rize. I want our Governor's Office and our Mayor to visit them as well. Later, I hope we can see Ayder in his place. And along with these, we will hopefully plan how we can quickly eliminate our deficiencies.
I wish you all a good night, I entrust you to Allah.

Organization of Turkic States 10. Their Speech at the Summit,2023-11-03,"

Dear Heads of State and Government,
Dear National Leader,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection.
Once again, I wish God's mercy on our Kazakh brothers who lost their lives in the mine accident in Karaganda, my condolences to all the Kazakh people, especially their grieving families, and a speedy recovery to the injured.
We are grateful to my dear brother, Mr. Mirziyoyev, the President of Uzbekistan, for his successful presidency. I would like to express my gratitude to my dear brother Mr. Tokayev, who took over the Presidency, for his exceptional hospitality and wish him success.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my brother Mirziyoyev, whom we will award with the Order of the Ali of the Turkic World.
Dear brothers and sisters,
Our most important strength in our fight against global challenges is the unity, solidarity and solidarity of the Turkic world. We have seen and continue to see this truth in many recent incidents. After the homeland war, Azerbaijan completely put an end to the 30-year-old occupation in Karabakh. We are very proud and delighted with this historic achievement. Thus, we are one step closer to lasting peace in our region. It is our greatest desire to take advantage of the window of opportunity that has opened. It is important for Armenia to fulfill its obligations towards Azerbaijan. It is also of great importance to implement the transport line that will connect the Western regions of Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan. The opening of the line will not only make a significant contribution to the welfare of all countries in the region, but will also connect Turkey to Central Asia, our ancestral homeland. In order for this process to be completed successfully, we, as the Turkic world, must continue our support to Azerbaijan.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Our culture and civilization advise us to observe justice, to hold the hand of the oppressed, and not to remain silent in the face of injustice. An unprecedented human tragedy is unfolding in Palestine before the eyes of the whole world. Hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, refugee camps are being bombed, innocent children are being brutally slaughtered. There is no concept to excuse what we have witnessed since October 7, to describe this atrocity. To put it bluntly; Crimes against humanity have been committed in Gaza for 28 days. From the moment this crisis first erupted, we, as Turkey, have adopted a principled and humanitarian stance. We have said and continue to say at every opportunity that we do not condone actions against civilians. Our priority is the speedy establishment of a humanitarian ceasefire. We are also working on new mechanisms to guarantee the safety of everyone, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish.
Our efforts to lay the groundwork for the International Peace Conference continue.
So far, we have shipped 10 planeloads of humanitarian aid to the region. We will continue to send new ones as conditions allow on the ground. Acting in unity and solidarity as the Turkic world will facilitate the path to a ceasefire and then to lasting peace. The stance we will take as the Organization of Turkic States will also set an example for other organizations.
The repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine War in areas such as energy, food and transportation negatively affect the whole world. As Turkey, we will continue our efforts to establish a just peace.
The establishment of sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan will serve lasting security and prosperity in the entire continent beyond Central Asia. As members of the Organization of Turkic States, the messages we will give in coordination to the current administration in Afghanistan are important in this respect.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
It is not possible for us to forget the solidarity you showed in the aftermath of the earthquakes, the disaster of the century, on February 6. The whole world witnessed this solidarity at the extraordinary summit we held in Ankara on March 16. With the decision we took in Ankara, we took an important step towards the establishment of the Civil Protection Mechanism of the Organization of Turkic States. We find it beneficial to complete the necessary processes as soon as possible and to implement the mechanism. Turkey continues its efforts to continue the successes of our organization so far.
The protocol on the amendment of the Nakhchivan Agreement was adopted by our Parliament on October 3, the day of cooperation between the Turkic states. As of November 1, we have completed the internal approval process of the protocol. I call on all member states to take the necessary steps to implement the protocol as soon as possible. Our current potential in various areas of cooperation, especially in trade and economy, energy and transportation, promises us much more.
We want the Istanbul-based Turkish Investment Fund, with which we signed the founding agreement at the Extraordinary Summit in Ankara, to start its activities as soon as possible. The agreement on this was also adopted in our Parliament the day before. Mega energy and transportation infrastructure projects have always been a fundamental and important area of cooperation between Turkic states. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan crude oil pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum natural gas pipeline and the Trans-Anatolian pipeline are concrete examples of this. The transportation of Caspian natural gas to Turkey and Europe will contribute to both the prosperity of the Turkic states and the energy security of Europe.
We should also focus on the goal of developing transport networks between our countries. With this understanding, we continue our efforts to activate the Trans-Caspian East-West Central Corridor. We should strengthen our cooperation in removing barriers to transportation and trade, enriching transportation networks, facilitating border crossings and visa procedures.
The International Combined Freight Transport Agreement and the Transport Connectivity Program signed at our Samarkand Summit make significant contributions. Today, we will prepare the Transport Joint Action Plan for the years 2023-2027 and determine our roadmap for the new period.
In addition to all these areas, we continue our efforts to strengthen our cooperation in the field of higher education in order to improve our human relations based on common language, culture and history. In particular, the importance of language unity for the strengthening of our unity and solidarity is obvious. The first step in this is to ensure alphabet unity. The support of the presidents is very, very important in this regard. I believe that the suggestions conveyed by our Higher Education Council to our secretariat will be evaluated in the best way by you, my esteemed brothers and sisters.
My friends
At our Samarkand Summit last year, our family council unanimously signed a historic decision by granting observer status to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I would like to thank you once again for your support in making this decision. With this decision, the Turkish world showed everyone that the Turkish Cypriots, who did not give up their homeland even though they were isolated, were not alone. It is the obligation of all of us to act in solidarity with the Turkish Cypriots, who are an integral part of the great Turkish family. I believe that at our next summit, we will see the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus among us with observer member status as we have decided. I trust your skilful leadership in this matter. On this occasion, I would like to emphasize once again that we would like to see our observer member Turkmenistan as a full member of our family council.
Dear brothers and sisters,
With the motto ""Our unity is our strength"", we aim to make the Turkic world stronger in every field and to make it more resilient and resilient in the face of different challenges. As leaders, we must guide the hearts that carry the flag of the Turkic world with the vision of a strong Turkic world in unity and solidarity. This year is the 100th. As the Republic of Turkey, which celebrates its anniversary, we will continue to take steps for the peace, prosperity and security of the entire Turkic world. By introducing our vision of the century of Turkey to our organization, we will work shoulder to shoulder to make the next period hopefully a Turkish era.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I greet you once again with respect. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the organization of the summit, especially our host Kazakhstan and President Tokayev. I hope that our consultations and the decisions we will take will be beneficial for all humanity, especially for our countries and the Turkic world.

Their Speech at the KeyVac Vaccine Production Center Opening Ceremony,2023-10-31,"

Dear people of Ankara,
Dear members of AlagÃ¶z Holding,
Dear guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I wish that the KeyVac Hepatitis-A Vaccine Production Factory, which we have opened, will be beneficial for our city and country. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate AlagÃ¶z Holding and my Chairman of the Board of Directors, CantÃ¼rk AlagÃ¶z, for the construction of this strategically important factory. I wish success to all our brothers and sisters who work and will work here.
AlagÃ¶z Holding, which has been operating in 9 different sectors, especially pharmaceuticals, chemicals and medical devices, since 2004, provides employment to nearly a thousand people with investments of up to 500 million dollars. We provide the necessary support to AlagÃ¶z Holding, as we do to every company that contributes to the development of our country.
We appreciate the investments made by our holding, especially in our capital city of IÄdÄ±r. The Hepatitis-A Vaccine Production Facility, which we have opened, will hopefully fill an important gap in its field. Our factory, which consists of a closed area of 14 thousand square meters, a factory production line of 12 thousand square meters and an office area of 2 thousand square meters, is equipped with the latest technology. With a total factory area of 29,500 square meters, KeyVac will hopefully play a leading role in the other vaccines it plans to produce.
What happened during the coronovirus epidemic has shown us how critical vaccine production capacity is. As a result of the decisive and effective steps taken by our government, Turkey has managed this process much more successfully than many countries in the world. We have not left any of our citizens unattended or helpless. Thanks to our strong infrastructure and encompassing social security system, we have provided first-class health care to all our people. Along with our own domestic vaccine, we offered all vaccines that have been registered against the epidemic to our citizens free of charge.
In the economy, we have stood by our business world and employees with different support packages. Despite all the pressure from the opposition, we refrained from taking drastic steps that would have devastating consequences for the economy.
In addition, we fulfilled our humanitarian duty by providing medical supplies to 161 countries and 12 international organizations during the epidemic period.
Our country has emerged from the pandemic, which is described as the biggest health crisis of the last century, not by weakening, but by getting stronger and increasing the number of its friends. I would like to congratulate all our officials, institutions and companies, especially our healthcare professionals, who contributed to this success.
Dear Friends;
Hepatitis-A vaccine is an inactivated vaccine used to prevent disease caused by the hepatitis-A virus. The vaccine has been included in the general immunization program since 2012. Two doses are administered to each child free of charge by the Ministry of Health, at the end of the 18th and 24th months. In addition, many people with chronic liver disease and coagulation disorders and those in the risk group are vaccinated. The hepatitis-A vaccine, which is mostly procured from abroad, will now be produced in our country at world standards. Thus, Turkey will become the 4th country to produce this vaccine at the highest standard.
With this important facility we have opened, our independence in hepatitis-A vaccine abroad or abroad will decrease. In addition, our country will have advanced technology and trained human resources in this field. I wish that the KeyVac Hepatitis-A Vaccine Production Factory, which was put into service at a time when we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of our Republic, will be beneficial once again.
I heartily congratulate you, our brothers and sisters, who have put their minds, efforts, knowledge and vision at the disposal of the Turkish century. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported our cause to grow Turkey with their investments, production and employment.
I greet each and every one of you with love and respect and entrust you to God.
Stay healthy.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Welcome to the Turkish House. As the name suggests, this building is the home of all Turks, and its door is always wide open to you. Â I would like to thank each and every one of you for your visits from different parts of America. This beautiful picture reflects our unity of heart in the best way.
With the exile you were subjected to in 1944, you suffered greatly and went through many hardships. Today, on this occasion, I wish Allah's mercy on those who lost their lives in exile, may Allah bless them all with his Paradise and Jamal.
The Meskhetian Turks spread to 9 different countries of the world with exile and lived under difficult conditions for years, but despite all the difficulties, they managed to preserve their identity and transfer their cultural heritage to future generations. No matter where they are, the hearts of the Meskhetian Turks have always beaten with Turkey. As Turkey, we are proud of the success stories you have written by facing all kinds of difficulties. We are determined to do our part to add new and bigger ones to these achievements. With this understanding, we follow the situation of the Meskhetian Turks very closely.
After the events in Ukraine began, we immediately contacted the authorities of this country and brought our Meskhetian brothers and sisters affected by the conflicts to our country, and we ensured that a total of one thousand families in different groups settled in Erzincan and Ahlat. In this way, the number of Meskhetian Turks who came to our country reaches 4 thousand.
In addition, we protect the history, art and cultural heritage of Meskhetia through various projects. We appreciate the various projects carried out by both the Presidency for Turks Abroad and TÄ°KA in this direction.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We do not see the peace and well-being of the Meskhetian Turks separately from our own citizens. We are taking the necessary steps for them to acquire the Turkish citizenship they have been longing for for years, and we are accelerating this process. Since 2022, with the support of our Ministry of Interior and the contributions of our embassies, consulates general and the World Union of Meskhetian Turks, 820 of our compatriots have gained Turkish citizenship. Hopefully, a little later, we will present the identity cards of the Republic of Turkey to our brothers and sisters representing you, and we will experience this joy together. We will quickly complete our work for our 578 compatriots whose transactions are ongoing. We are the government that protects the Meskhetian Turks the most and follows their issues very closely.
Before us, the number of Meskhetian Turks who were granted citizenship was quite limited. Between 1992 and 2003, only 4,840 of our brothers and sisters benefited from this right, while this figure exceeded 60,000 in our period. We continue our contacts with our interlocutors for the voluntary return of the Meskhetian Turks to their homeland. We are making efforts to resolve this issue on the basis of friendship, respect and goodwill, within a humanitarian and legal framework. Hopefully, from now on, we will consider your case as our cause and we will make all necessary diplomatic efforts.
On this occasion, I would like to draw your attention to a few issues that I think are important. Societies are strong to the extent that they are in unity and solidarity and receive the respect they deserve. Let's act in coordination on all issues concerning the Meskhetian Turkish community, including transitions to Turkish citizenship. I especially ask you to be in close coordination with our embassies and consulates general and the World Union of Meskhetian Turks. It is one of our priorities for Meskhetian Turks to protect their identity, language, religion and culture in the countries they live in. We will continue to contribute to your work in this direction.
I find it very beneficial for you to strengthen your cooperation with other Turkish and Muslim non-governmental organizations in the United States. In the face of the recent increase in racism and Islamophobia, you need to act together and put a stop to such tendencies together. It is important that you show sensitivity in the face of unfair, unlawful and discriminatory understanding targeting Muslims. While preserving your culture, I also care about your integration with the society you live in and being represented effectively. In this context, your active participation in American civil society will be a strong legacy for the next generation. We expect you not to allow anyone to sow discord among you. We will concentrate our energy not on internal fights, but on the success of our struggle.
In closing, I would like to state once again that as Turkey, we will continue to stand by the Meskhetian Turks as we have done so far.

Mr. President, Mr. Speaker of the Parliament,
Dear Prime Minister,
Dear Chairmen of our Political Parties,
Honourable Ministers, Honourable Members of Parliament,
Dear Guests,
On behalf of myself and your brothers and sisters in Turkey, I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I am very pleased to open the new terminal and runway of our Ercan Airport with you.
I would like to take this opportunity to heartily congratulate the 49th anniversary of the Peace Operation, in which we shouted to friend and foe that the Turkish Cypriot presence on the island is permanent.
Ercan Airport, which was opened to civil air traffic on February 3, 1975, had a terminal building of 20 thousand square meters, a parking area of 34 thousand square meters and a main runway of 2 thousand 755 meters. Our airport has the capacity to host wide-body aircraft with its terminal building and double runway, which were equipped with new facilities and capabilities, the construction of which started in 2016.
Ercan Airport, which was built on a total area of 7 million 800 thousand square meters, has been made suitable for the use of all models of passenger aircraft thanks to its new runway of 3 thousand 100 meters in length compared to the existing runway of 2 thousand 755 meters.
The new terminal has been enlarged 6 times compared to the old one, so it can serve 10 million passengers.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
In addition to its direct contribution to tourism, a more modern and capable terminal building means more investment, more income and more employment. As of today, Ercan Airport is the airport with the largest passenger capacity on the island of Cyprus. This work will contribute to making the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is a basin of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, a brand in the region.
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the commissioning of this important work, from the study to the construction and operation.
Due to the unfair and unlawful practices of the international community, direct flights are only operated to Turkey with Ercan Airport. Turkish Cypriots provide air traffic services in accordance with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization within the Ercan-recommended airspace. The airport provides services to domestic and foreign passengers with advanced technology and Turkish hospitality. The days are not far when the new terminal and runway, which we are inaugurating today, will be used for international flights.
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the international community to lift these purely political restrictions that lack a legal basis, heeding the call of the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who acknowledged that there was no United Nations Security Council resolution to justify or justify the isolation suffered by our Turkish Cypriot brothers.
I reiterate my call to support the ideal of two equal states living side by side, not the culture of domination, tension and conflict on the island of Cyprus.
In closing, I would like to congratulate you once again on your July 20 Peace and Freedom Day. I commemorate all our martyrs, veterans and heroes, especially our Martyr Major Fehmi Ercan, who gave his name to our airport.
I greet you all with respect and love, with good health.

Their Speech at the July 15 Martyrs' Commemoration Program,2023-07-15,"

Dear Nation,
Dear Istanbulites,
Honourable Chairmen of Political Parties,
Dear Relatives of Our Martyrs,
Our Heroic Veterans,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. Â From here, I convey my greetings and respects to all of Istanbul, all of Turkey, and every individual of 85 million people through you. I would like to express my gratitude to all the heroes of the Turkish century.15 July 7. On the Anniversary, as 85 million, we are again one heart, one wrist. We are together to commemorate our martyrs and celebrate our victory of national will.
I pray for God's mercy on all our heroes who watered the thousand-year-old land of Shuheda with their blessed blood on the night of July 15 and were martyred while protecting their state, nation, independence and will. On this meaningful day, when we salute one of the glorious pages of our struggle for independence, I would like to thank everyone who honored the saintly souls of our martyrs with the prayers they read and marshmallow sharifs.
From the fight against terrorism to the operations we carry out beyond our borders, I gratefully commemorate all the brave men who rushed to witness for the survival of our homeland and the peace of our nation without blinking. May Allah bless our martyrs with his Paradise and Jamal. On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to express my gratitude to all my brothers and sisters who have been honored with the honor of veteranship, and wish them a long life.
On behalf of myself, my family and my nation, I would like to thank everyone who took to the streets from the first moments of the uprising and did not allow the coup plotters to pass by taking critical notes. I send my greetings and affection to my citizens and true friends of Turkey, who followed the coup attempt all over the world with their hearts in their mouths and prayed that Turkey would not be harmed.
At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to restate a fact; We are a nation that believes that its martyrs live and lives with its martyrs. Much more lies beneath the ground than is above it. Just as it is our duty to protect the values for which our martyrs sacrificed their lives, it is also our duty not to forget those who attempted their lives.
We noted who stood where on that historic night, when the independence of the nation was saved by the determination and decision of the nation. Just as we know the FETÃ traitors, we have also indelibly recorded the forces that supported the traitors and the forces that supported them in our memory. We have not forgotten and we do not forget the wicked hands that applauded the traitors while the nation resisted the coup at the cost of their lives, the cowards who made a deal with the coup plotters and escaped from the tanks while people rushed to witness, and the indignities who raised a glass to the murderers of these children while young children of 15-16 years old fell to the ground.
The late Alija IzetbegoviÄ said, ""The forgotten genocide will happen again."" The late Mehmet Akif, on the other hand, warns that history will repeat itself for those who do not learn a lesson. None of us can ignore these warnings, filtered through pain. If we forget July 15, we will be honoring the saintly souls of our martyrs and violating the rights of the innocent. If we forget, we will be ashamed of the heroes of all ages who stand up to the gangs of treachery by taking their ablutions. If we forget, God forbid, we will cause similar disasters to happen again. Not only that, but we encourage new attempts at betrayal and incur greater troubles. We must keep in mind that, like the forgotten genocide, the forgotten betrayal will hit us in the back in a much more treacherous and insidious way. For this purpose, as you know, we declared July 15 as the Day of Democracy and National Unity.
With the various programs we organize throughout our country every July 15, we comprehend the present in accordance with its place in our history. Today, we commemorate July 15 all over Turkey, we commemorate our martyrs, because we will not forget them, we will not let them be forgotten. We express our gratitude to our veterans. We remember and remind again of the epic written in blood that night. Together, we are sending a clear message to the lurking forces; On the 7th anniversary of July 15, I declare once again that we will not allow July 15 to be forgotten and forgotten, even if 7 years or 70 years have passed. We will keep our anger against the scoundrels who shed the blood of our children alive and vigorous. We will not allow any insidious scenario to disrupt our unity and solidarity.
Brothers
There are some turning points in the history of nations, July 15 is such a milestone for us. Making the Anatolian lands we live on a thousand-year-old homeland is one of the most important phases of our 200-year struggle for survival.
I would like to remember once again that on the night of July 15, we not only repelled a bloody and treacherous coup attempt, but also wrote a great epic that will be told with glory, honor and pride from generation to generation as a nation. We have declared to the whole world that the national will cannot be surrendered with tanks, cannons, rifles and planes raining bombs on civilians. We have reminded the invaders and their pawns very clearly that Turkey is impassable.
As a nation, we have shown the whole world how to stand up, how to be united, how to become one heart.
We have shown how people of all ages, groups and political views can come together overnight when it comes to their independence.
July 15 is our honor, our dignity, our medal of honor.
July 15 is the declaration of the national will, the declaration of independence.
All of our 81 provinces have been the scene of an unprecedented resistance.
This is the resistance of those who do not pay attention to the barrels resting on their clean foreheads and give their lives for their country and nation.
This is the resistance of those who, in the prime of their lives, face tanks, rifles and bullets without thinking.
This is the resistance of those who burn the sustenance of their children, the one-year harvest of their fields, the tires of their trucks and tractors and try to stop the coup plotters.
This is the resistance of our nation, which flocks to the streets with salas rising from our minarets and keeps a vigil for democracy in the squares.
This is the resistance of those who gave their lives and drank the syrup of witness in order not to leave their independence and future at the mercy and disposal of terrorist organizations.
This is the resistance of magnanimous hearts who have turned their faces to Turkey, opened their hearts to Turkey, and instilled hope in the oppressed who have pinned their hopes on Turkey.
Our beloved nation, whose purpose, conscience, joy and pain are one, has put a stop to the traitors at the cost of its life as a single front.
Brothers;
""Isn't it that faith is one in the front of our front;
Rejoicing is one, pain is one, the goal is the same, conscience is one;
Isn't it that the heart that beats is indomitable,
Even if the world collapses, rest assured that this front will not be shaken.""
As Mehmet Akif said, this front will never be shaken, because there is the apocalyptic conscience of 85 million people on this front. There is the sincerity of sparkling young people with freshly sweated mustaches. Ladies, do not forget that there is a sacrifice of Nene Hatuns, Åerife BacÄ±'s and Kara Fatma's here. This is how I see you, and this is how I see our martyred policeman Paradise girl. They were undaunted and marched to witness.
""If you squeeze the soil that will spring up in Shuheda, Shuheda!
May he take my life, my soul, my whole being,
Don't let me be a dwarf of my only homeland in the world.""
We cannot forget the courage of our women who took their flags in their hands and stood up to the traitors. We cannot forget the faith of the brave men who single-handedly resisted the coup plotters, knowing that they would be martyred. We cannot forget the tenacity of the heroes who shielded their chests against weapons that spewed death. We cannot forget the love of the country of those who made the crescent-star flag shroud from Istanbul to Ankara. We cannot forget the prudence of those who put aside their political differences and stand shoulder to shoulder. As long as this front, which saved Turkey from an invasion attempt, exists, no one can put a chain on the will of our nation, God willing.
Brothers; I believe in you, together with you, we will walk on this path with much more confident steps.
Do you know how Mr. Kemal, who arrived at the airport at 23:15 on the evening of July 15 at AtatÃ¼rk Airport, slipped through the tanks? Where did the FETÃ members take Mr. Kemal from among the tanks and take him? They took them to BakÄ±rkÃ¶y Municipality. What did he say? If I had known that ErdoÄan was coming, I would have waited. Should we believe it? If I had known that you would go like that, I would have landed our plane early, not landed a little later, and met you there. They're timid, they're cowards, they're wimps, nothing will happen to them.
Brothers
July 15, of course, was carried out primarily against us and our government. The traitors who plotted the coup were so blinded that they made an attempt on our lives. We narrowly escaped the assassination squad sent to where we were staying. During that long night, we survived many troubles and attacks. My bodyguards were martyred. However, the real addressee of the July 15 uprising was the nation, the national will, and the independence of our country.
Turkey was not subjected to an ordinary coup attempt, but to an all-out invasion attempt. When we look at the institutions targeted by the coup plotters, we can see this very clearly. Our Presidential Complex, which is the home of the nation, was bombed, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which is the manifestation of the national will, was bombed. Our National Intelligence Organization, Special Operations Directorate, Ankara Police Department and other units were heavily attacked. The traitors not only tried to overthrow the government, but also targeted the symbols of the Republic of Turkey. It is not easy, we had 251 martyrs that day, the next day. We had more than 2,200 veterans.
They aimed to drive a wedge between our nation and its army, which it saw as the hearth of the Prophet. We look at our army as the hearth of the Prophet, but they do not have such a problem. Notice, what is the name of our soldier? Tommy. Why did we call our soldiers MehmetÃ§ik? We called the name Little Muhammad MehmetÃ§ik and this is how it comes from history, little Muhammad means MehmetÃ§ik. There is no such name in any country in the world, in the Islamic world, only we have it, so MehmetÃ§ik is very important. We don't feed them, we don't feed them, we do whatever is necessary.
By creating insecurity within public institutions, they aimed to weaken and weaken our state. They wanted to inflict irreparable wounds on our national structure by dynamiting the state-nation fusion, which is the greatest guarantee of a country's survival.
The occupation of the bridge connecting east and west, Europe and Asia was undoubtedly a message. That's where that bridge is. What happened, were they able to invade? They couldn't. Reason? My people lay down under the tanks with their men and women and resisted there, our bridge was not occupied, it could not be occupied.
With the July 15 resistance, we tore up all these dirty scenarios; We will not be slaves, we said, we will not bow to the mandate. We said we would not dismantle our state. We said we would not invade Turkey. We said that we will not silence our prayers, we will not have our glorious flag lowered. In one night, we martyred 253 sons of the country, men and women, young and old, but we did not let the scoundrels come to our country. We did not have our temples touched by the hand of honor. We did not surrender to the FETÃ scoundrels.
I say it very clearly, those who do not understand the spirit of July 15 cannot understand Ãanakkale, Sakarya and DumlupÄ±nar.
Those who cannot understand the spirit of July 15 cannot understand the love of independence in the codes of our nation.
Those who cannot understand July 15 cannot understand the meaning of the verse, ""It is the right, the independence of my nation that worships the Truth.""
Those who cannot understand July 15 cannot understand the sons of this nation who flooded Ankara from Anatolian cities by saying that it could not have been one of us who bombed Ankara in the first hours of the coup attempt.
Those who cannot understand July 15 cannot understand our prayerful mothers who say that God will not harm the state and the nation.
Those who cannot understand July 15 cannot understand the noble stance of this nation that does not bow down to marauders, jackals and juntaists.
Those who cannot understand July 15 cannot understand that we owe our existence to our martyrs and veterans.
By Allah's leave, no one will be able to tarnish the July 15 resistance. It is not enough to measure the wisdom of our nation, which has been tested with its life and passed the test, and the reproaches of the heedless people who slander July 15 with a controlled coup. Neither we nor our nation will allow July 15 to be diluted. As long as Turkey exists, our epic of July 15 will continue to be passed from language to language like a victory song.
Dear Nation,
Dear Istanbulites,
Our homeland poet, the late NamÄ±k Kemal, said, ""Our deeds are our efkar, ikbÃ¢l-i vatan"". Our ambition, idea and goal is the iqbal of our homeland, where a martyr lies in every inch of land, and the future of our nation. With this understanding, we have made historical reforms in every field in the last 21 years, and we have signed numerous works, investments, projects and actions. Thankfully, we have lifted the shadow of tutelage over our democracy. For the first time with the presidential system of government, we have succeeded in demonstrating our system of government through the ballot box. By making the civil will prevail with all its elements, we have saved Turkey from the maelstrom of political instability, social chaos and coup d'Ã©tat. We have reaped the fruits of these moves in many areas, and we are reaping them.
As our country removed the shackles on its feet, it began to defend its interests more strongly and to seek its rights more skillfully. As our army, police department, civil and judicial organizations were cleared of FETÃ traitors, they became better able to perform their primary duties. Our fight against terrorism continues in a much stronger way in Cudi, Gabar, TendÃ¼rek, Bestler Creek, and across the border. With our operations against Syria, we have foiled the plans to surround our country with a terror corridor. As soon as the members of the separatist terrorist organization raise their heads, we bring down the iron fist of our state on their heads. But beware, someone is also looking for support from Qandil. What does it say? ""We are with Mr. Kemal,"" he said. Either you lick your palm when folks aren't there for you. We are marching with our nation, they are marching with Qandil, this is the difference between us.
By using all the diplomatic, political, judicial and intelligence means of our state, we are making the world narrow for FETÃ members. In many countries of the world, we have ensured that the hotbeds of strife operating under the guise of educational institutions are closed or transferred to the Turkish Maarif Foundation. We have extradited more than 100 members of the organization who are on the run to our country for trial. Our operations to decipher the secret structure of the organization continue uninterruptedly.
The number of states, especially friendly and brotherly countries, that realize the true face of this organization and take measures against FETÃ is increasing day by day. Finally, at the NATO Summit, we once again expressed our uncompromising stance against FETÃ and other terrorist organizations. You watched the NATO Leaders' Summit, right? You saw the vibe there, didn't you?
Now, at this time of the day, let's raise our hands in this beautiful place at Beylerbeyi Stadium, let's call out to Turkey from the television screens together; Are we ready?
One nation... One flag... One homeland... One state...
We will be one... We're going to be big... We will be alive... We will be brothers... Together, we will be Turkey...
Mashallah, thank you, be present. Al-Fatiha to the souls of all our martyrs.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings at this meaningful graduation ceremony. I am pleased to be at HaydarpaÅa High School, which is one of the most established educational institutions of our country with its history of nearly 89 years.
I wish that the 2022-2023 academic year, which we have successfully completed today, will be beneficial for all stakeholders of our education community. I congratulate all of our children who are currently experiencing the joy of report cards in all corners of our country, and I kiss each and every one of them on their foreheads. Â At the end of each academic year, we are proud to see that knowledgeable, cultured, moral, conscientious and self-confident generations are raised, just like in HaydarpaÅa High School. Every time we meet with our students, we look at our future with more hope and confidence. As we listen to the voices of our children, our belief in Turkey's bright future increases exponentially.
Undoubtedly, our teachers are at the forefront of those who are instrumental in this. Our teachers, to whom we entrust our children from the age of five or six, are the backbone of our education system. In our culture, the teacher is not just the one who transmits knowledge. The teacher is also an explorer who brings out the essence in his student. He is a worker of the heart who processes his character with compassion. Our teachers are guides who prepare our children for life with their knowledge as well as their experience. Hazrat Ali, who said, ""I will be a slave for 40 years to anyone who teaches me 1 letter"", actually draws the boundaries of a student's debt of loyalty to his teacher with this statement. As members of a faith whose first commandment is ""Read"", we cannot repay our teachers who instill wisdom, wisdom and morality in us as well as knowledge. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to express my gratitude to all our teachers who work with the ideal of raising individuals who are beneficial to the country, the nation and the state.
I sincerely congratulate the parents who mobilize all the means at their disposal for the education of their children. Due to the earthquakes that occurred on February 6 this year, we are spending our religious and national holidays a little bittersweet as a country and a nation. Today, unfortunately, we cannot fully breathe the joy of receiving a report card. The pain of more than 50 thousand of our citizens, especially our students and teachers, whom we buried in the disaster of the century, still burns our hearts. On this occasion, we pray for God's mercy on our brothers and sisters who died in the February 6 earthquakes, and our condolences to their relatives and our beloved nation.
From AybÃ¼ke YalÃ§Ä±n to Necmettin YÄ±lmaz, I commemorate each of our 192 martyred teachers here with mercy. Hopefully, as a state and a nation, we will protect the relics of our martyred teachers and continue to keep alive the traits for which they sacrificed their lives. We will also rebuild our cities that were adversely affected by the earthquake as soon as possible.
Dear Friends,
We have approximately 27 million students, 19 million of whom are in basic and secondary education and 8 million in higher education. We mobilize the opportunities we have to ensure that these children, who are the guarantee of our future, grow up in the best way possible. Since 2002, we have allocated the lion's share of the budget to education every year, doubled the number of classrooms, provided our schools with the latest technology education infrastructure, distributed the educational materials needed by our students free of charge from textbooks to supplementary resources, improved the financial and personal rights of our teachers every year, in short, we attach importance to this issue by not hesitating to do whatever is necessary for our children to receive quality education. We showed.
With the appointment of a total of 45,000 new teachers last month, we have further strengthened our existing education army. While there were a total of 500 thousand teachers in our country in 2002, the number of teachers who started to work only in our period reached 800 thousand with the last appointment. We will continue to appoint teachers in areas where they are needed. We will soon share with the public our projects that will increase the reputation of the teaching profession and improve the careers of our teachers. Hopefully, we will make the schools sparkling in the summer and make them ready for the new term. We will make every effort to ensure that our students receive quality education and that our teachers perform their duties with peace of mind.
Dear Students,
This year, on October 29, we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of our Republic. The 100th anniversary of our Republic. We have made the Year the starting point of our vision of the Turkish century. For the next 5 years, we will work day and night for the construction of the Turkish century. We will hand over a country that you will be proud of in every respect, to you, our children, in whose eyes I see the great and powerful Turkey of tomorrow. For this, we all have a responsibility with parents, teachers and students. We will trust Turkey, we will believe in our own potential. We will never stop dreaming. We will not put anyone between us and our goals. We will always be honored to be a citizen of this country. We will never think of anything other than pride in being a member of this nation full of historical victories.
We will read, research, question, work, and hold on to the values that make us who we are and our roots. If we do these things, no one will be able to stop us, God willing. Remember, the Turkey of tomorrow will hopefully rise on your shoulders.
Today, you are receiving your report cards, and I hope you will see the results of your efforts for a year. As a TEKNOFEST youth, you will now aim to be intertwined with space at all times. While you are having a pleasant time with your friends and loved ones in the summer, please do not cut your ties with books, the library and reading. In these summer days when all the beauties of nature are laid out in front of us, do not condemn yourself only to the screen. Don't let your enthusiasm for learning new things fade.
We have free summer schools and youth camps opened in many different areas to help you. But in saying that, I have to say one more thing; Don't get carried away by under-the-stairs snatchers.
Our Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Presidency of Religious Affairs are working for you. I believe that you will make the best use of these opportunities offered by our state.
With these thoughts, I congratulate each of you and wish you a happy, peaceful and productive holiday. I wish success to all our young people who will take the Higher Education Institutions Exam this weekend.
I would like to thank our esteemed teachers for their efforts and entrust you all to Allah.
Have a nice holiday, stay healthy.

Their Speech at the Opening of VanikÃ¶y Mosque,2023-06-16,"

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection, peace be upon you and 'mercy' and 'barakatuh'. I am pleased to be with you on such a meaningful day for our ÃskÃ¼dar. I praise my Lord, who brought our hearts together and made us experience this joy.
The historical VanikÃ¶y Mosque was one of the symbolic places of ÃskÃ¼dar. The 358-year-old VanikÃ¶y Mosque, which is among the pearls of the Bosphorus, was unfortunately heavily damaged in the fire that broke out 2.5 years ago. The wooden roof and the mahfil section of our mosque were completely burned, and the interiors of the HÃ¼nkar Pavilion became unusable. After this fire, which burned our hearts as a resident and lover of ÃskÃ¼dar, the known circles immediately started to abuse, they stated that this place would be completely demolished and opened to rent, and they spread a lot of chants that do not fit into reason, conscience and morality. As they always do, they tried to cloud the minds of our brothers and sisters in Istanbul with lies, distortions and deceits. We did not listen to any of these, and we took swift action to revive this rare heirloom with a mission of loyalty to the city.
A restoration protocol was signed between our Istanbul Second Regional Directorate of Foundations, Mehmet Vani Foundation and Kalyon Foundation. After a comprehensive preparation process, the Kalyon Foundation immediately rolled up its sleeves in order to bring our mosque back to our city in accordance with its original. Pine timbers were procured in Dursunbey, oak timbers were procured from Yenice, marbles were procured from Marmara Island, and our mosque was completely renovated using original materials. In addition, the ground floor of the HÃ¼nkar Pavilion in the mosque was offered to the use of our citizens as a library.
Approximately 1600 works selected with meticulous work will be open to the use of everyone who visits our mosque, especially our young people. VanikÃ¶y Mosque, which is one of the symbolic architectural works of not only ÃskÃ¼dar but also Istanbul, was the heart of this region for 3.5 centuries until it was destroyed in a fire. Since the 18th century, it has been one of the visits of the sultans. I believe that our mosque, together with its library, will soon become one of the new haunts of Istanbul.
I wish that the VanikÃ¶y Mosque, which we reopened for worship after the restoration, will be beneficial to our district and Istanbul. I would like to thank everyone, from workers to architects, engineers, masters and artists, who contributed to bringing this magnificent work to our city.
I wholeheartedly congratulate the Kalyon Foundation, which voluntarily undertook the restoration of the mosque and fulfilled this task in the best way possible.
I would also like to congratulate the Ministry of Culture and Tourism for embracing and strongly supporting the project from the first day.
In addition to being places of worship, all of our mosques are also title deeds that show that these lands belong to us forever. Mosques are our identity cards, our spiritual bridges that connect us to our glorious past of thousands of years. I consider it necessary to protect our heirloom works in order to preserve our roots and spiritual ties.
With each of our cultural heritage we revive, we are also building an unshakable bridge from the past to the present and the future. With every work we restore, we strengthen our nation's existence even more. With the historical buildings that we have brought back to life in accordance with the original, we are paying our debt of loyalty to our civilization as well as Istanbul. While weaving all over the country, we pay special attention to the smoking of the hearths of faith that feed our spiritual world.
My Lord, I pray that the congregation from inside our mosque, which we have restored with this sensitivity, does not miss the call to prayer from its minarets, and the sounds of the Qur'an from its dome. On this occasion, I commemorate Mehmet Vani Efendi, who gave his name to our mosque, with mercy and gratitude. May my Lord bless your soul and make your place Paradise.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Our love, affection and loyalty to Istanbul, which has history gushing from every corner and every stone, is different. We love this city, which was entrusted to us by Sultan Fatih, UlubatlÄ± Hasan and AkÄ±ncÄ±, together with all its districts. We are the lovers, the servants of this beautiful city, which has been praised by the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). We do not leave our love for Istanbul only in words like some others, we show our sincerity by embroidering every square meter of Istanbul with our works, investments and projects. We fulfill the requirements of our affection by serving all Istanbulites without any discrimination. We are trying to fulfill our debt of gratitude to Istanbul by protecting the historical and cultural texture of this ancient city more. To this day, we have revived many ancestral heirlooms that have been abandoned to their fate. In accordance with the will of Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han, we brought the Hagia Sophia Mosque together with the Azan-Ä± Muhammedi again after 86 years of separation.
With the Great ÃamlÄ±ca Mosque, we have brought a magnificent work to Istanbul that has become a symbol of the city. We placed a rose in the heart of Istanbul by building the Taksim Mosque, which was once used as an excuse for guardianship attempts. From the Rami Library to the EminÃ¶nÃ¼ New Mosque, we have restored many works of art while preserving their historical identity and presented them to the benefit of our nation. By building the Levent captain-Ä± derya, Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha Mosque in Levent, we brought a magnificent work to that region again. Since 2002, we have restored and revived approximately 5,500 works of art only through our General Directorate of Foundations.
In addition to these, we have brought Istanbul together with the investments it deserves in every field from airports to rail systems, from city hospitals to schools, roads, bridges and cultural centers. The total amount of public investments we have made in Istanbul in the last 21 years exceeds 812 billion liras with current figures.
Istanbul, which was neglected for decades in our country, had experienced its golden years in terms of local administrations since 1994. However, we are sadly witnessing that Istanbul has entered an Interregnum in terms of local services for a few years. In the next 9 months, we will work together and hopefully take Istanbul out of this Interregnum in which it has been dragged. I pray that God will help us.
With these thoughts, I would like to congratulate those who contributed to the revival and restoration of our VanikÃ¶y Mosque. I would like to thank in advance all my brothers and sisters who took care of our mosque and revived and rebuilt this work with their prayers, prayers and scientific studies.
I pray that the prayers and worship to be made here will be accepted and accepted in the sight of God.
I wish you a blessed Friday, I say stay healthy and we move on to prayer.

Dear Nation,
Dear Istanbulites,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. Today, we are together on the occasion of the anniversary of one of the blackest days in the history of our Republic. 63 years ago, on May 27, Turkey experienced its first military coup since the transition to multi-party politics. This coup d'Ã©tat, carried out by a group within the Turkish Armed Forces, has not only hindered our democracy and development move, but has also caused deep wounds in our hearts. Menderes, who had a special place in the hearts of our nation with his services to our country as the Chairman and Prime Minister of the Democratic Party, was executed by the decision of the fake court established by the coup administration. YassÄ±ada, where Menderes and his friends were tried, has been pronounced as ""YaslÄ±ada"" in the language of our citizens for many years.
We took this place and turned it into the Island of Democracy and Freedom in a way that will keep the memory of our martyrs alive forever. Today, on the anniversary of the coup d'Ã©tat, which was the beginning of the process leading to their execution, we are here at the mausoleum to commemorate the late Menderes and his friends. As long as the world stops, Menderes will be remembered with goodness, Fatiha and prayer. Those who overthrew Menderes, put him on trial, executed him, and those who directly or indirectly supported this whole process have always been remembered with hatred by our nation and will continue to be remembered as such.
Yes, Menderes was a man of this nation. Those who were other people's men never liked Menderes or those like him who undersigned the country's democracy and development breakthroughs. Not only that, but they tried and struggled at every opportunity to drive a wedge between them and the nation, and if they could not succeed in that, they tried to eliminate their bodies. The deceased Ãzal, who was in his eternal resting place in another mausoleum nearby, was subjected to similar attacks and experienced similar problems.
Since the Mayorship, our Prime Minister and Presidency periods have passed through the same struggles. But, thank God, the dark ambitions about our country have never succeeded in all sense.
Turkish democracy has staggered with the wound it received with a May 27, and now, 63 years later, we are looking forward to announcing the good news of the end of the era of coups, juntas and memorandums at the polls tomorrow, another May 27. Our nation knows very well the value of its democracy, behind which there are many struggles, pains and sacrifices. The turnout rates in the elections are an expression of our nation's protection of its independence and future through democracy. Turkey has distinguished itself by conducting the elections in a transparent and fair manner, as well as with a level of participation that is unparalleled in the world.
Brothers
While I greet you with the most heartfelt sensitivity, I wish God's mercy on our Prime Minister and our President on the other. I wish God's mercy on our martyrs. On the other hand, I wish God's mercy on our teacher Erbakan.
While I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings, I also recommend that you go to the polls with sensitivity tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is a special day especially for us.
Be thankful, be present, be entrusted to God.

Dear Youth,
Dear AdÄ±yamanians,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. We wanted to start our first visit to the earthquake zone with young people again. With the energy we receive from you and the support we receive from you, we will visit our earthquake zone cities with AdÄ±yaman, KahramanmaraÅ, Hatay, Gaziantep, Malatya, Sivas.
We have always been around since the February 6 earthquakes, which is the biggest disaster our country has experienced. Of course, we do not visit these places like earthquake tourists like some others. We follow every work done step by step since the search and rescue operations, and we work to ensure that there is no shortcoming, no delay. With our ministers, institutions, municipalities, non-governmental organizations, volunteers and members of the People's Alliance, we have never left our earthquake victims alone.
In particular, we are close witnesses of the sincere efforts and self-sacrificing work of our young people in this process.
In our country, some people have always tried to drive a wedge between us and you by always underestimating young people and instilling pessimism in them. However, throughout our political life, we have always walked the road with young people and fought with them in every struggle. While they tried to draw boundaries to the horizons of our young people by labeling them with letters, we have always worked to expand the vision of our young people with technology, sports, art and culture. Thankfully, we get the results of this everywhere we go. We said TEKNOFEST youth, we were happy with the news that 1 million young people participated in the competitions in the last event alone. We called it the youth of the century of Turkey. Contrary to what is claimed and believed in the elections, we received the greatest support from our young people.
We called it self-confident youth. We are proud of their achievements all over the world in every field from sports to science.
Today, we are here with 1500 young people. Here, we see that a school of life has been established with its library, workshops, sports fields, classrooms and Uzbek tents. BeÅpÄ±nar Culture, Education and Social Support Camp not only supports the education of our children and young people, but also prepares them for life. The sparkle in your eyes gives us the determination to work harder and take on bigger challenges. With the energy we receive from our youth, we are establishing the values on which we will build the future of our country in our cities in the earthquake zone. In this context, we are bringing some of the important production facilities of the defense industry sector to our region. For example, we are establishing a cable and connector production facility and creating a software campus in AdÄ±yaman.
The fact that we have exceeded the OECD average in some age groups in education, and that we are about to catch up with it, indicates that we are heading in the right direction. In particular, we have made a silent revolution in vocational education. We have brought vocational education, which was deliberately undermined for a while, shaken in contact and its charm removed, back to the place it deserves.
Even the activities in our camp are enough to show how eager our young people are to improve themselves in line with the needs of the age and our country. In the coming period, we will not only expand the alternative education opportunities in front of our young people, but also focus on increasing the quality in a way that competes with the world.
From Turkey, which lost its educated people to the outside world in the past, we have now become an attractive country for both its own children and individuals who have grown up from abroad. Hopefully, in the coming period, we will shape a great and powerful Turkey step by step together.
Youths
Remember, I always say that we are now the guests of your time. You are the future of Turkey. As the President, my duty is to leave you a Turkey where you can realize your dreams in the easiest way possible. We lived our youth in really difficult times for our country. The generation before us struggled under much more difficult conditions. The previous generation was already the generation of national struggle. We should not forget the conditions under which we liberated our homeland from the enemy, how we established our last state, our Republic. We should never forget what we went through during the first century of our Republic. For this reason, we underline the importance of a youth that is committed to its history, ancestors, values and culture at every opportunity. If we don't know where we're coming from, we don't know where we're standing or where we're going. If we do not know that there is a difference in age between the Turkey of a quarter of a century ago and the Turkey of today, we cannot understand why we call it the Turkish century.
Today, we cannot look to our future with confidence if we do not know what those who did not stop insulting the earthquake victims just because they could not get the votes they wanted from the region, inflicted on our nation yesterday. My request to our young people is to use the unlimited sources of information at your disposal to confirm all these things I have said, based on accurate and reliable references. When you do this, you will see that there is nothing more than what we say.
Some may be doing politics only to achieve their own personal goals, and when they fail to do so, they may exhibit all kinds of ugliness. Our politics is the politics of work and service. I believe that our greatest work is to provide you with the opportunity to develop in all areas of life, as we are here today. You now have representatives of your age in the Parliament. Hopefully, we will see the representatives who will emerge from among you in the upcoming elections in the Parliament. This alone is a sign of how much we trust and believe in our young people.
May Allah make your fortune, future and horizon clear. May Allah grant you all an education, a profession, a job and a career to your heart's content. May God compare you all with good people, beautiful people, good people throughout your lives. I would like to thank each and every one of you for being here with us today.
Thank you, be present.

We have worked day and night for 21 years to bring our children together with their dreams. Now, we want to crown the level we have brought our country to with the Turkish century. We are in intense preparation and effort for this.
We were very happy to bring many projects to our country, such as our Anatolian Ship, which we just sent off from the Bosphorus together.
Of course, in the flow of life, disasters and, unfortunately, losses can be experienced as well as successes and gains. This is how we experienced sadness in the earthquake disasters we experienced last February. More than 50 thousand of our citizens who lost their lives left behind their loved ones. There are also those among you who lost their relatives and acquaintances in these earthquakes. I wish Allah's mercy on all of these brothers and sisters who have migrated to the eternal world.
Our state and nation have mobilized all their means to heal the wounds of the earthquake and to protect those left behind. Hopefully, within 1 year, we will restore our cities and return our earthquake victims to their normal lives.
As a matter of fact, I was in KahramanmaraÅ yesterday, beyond that it was in Nurdagi, we delivered village houses in Nurdagi, and we met with our earthquake victims in KahramanmaraÅ in the same way. We cannot bring back our people who lost their lives, but we will protect the relics they left behind. I believe that we can repay our loyalty to our earthquake martyrs and their relics by making the new century of our Republic the century of Turkey.
Our nation has left behind many troubles, attacks and disasters, especially by embracing its unity, solidarity and brotherhood. By Allah's leave, we will erase the traces of the February 6 earthquakes in the same way.
I ask you to strengthen our nation's trust in you by educating yourself in the best way in the light of science and our values.
I congratulate you once again on your April 23 National Sovereignty and Children's Day, and I kiss all the children of our nation on their eyes in front of you.

Dear Nation,
Dear Istanbulites,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Youth,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. We are in a very different place and I congratulate you on your Ramadan Feast in this place.
We are happy that we completed these restoration works on such a meaningful day, and today we experienced two holidays together thanks to the Ramadan Feast, which falls on Friday.
We performed the Eid prayer at the Hagia Sophia Mosque. As you know, after a long period of sadness, we reopened Hagia Sophia for worship on a Friday 3 years ago. Praise be to God, since that day, Hagia Sophia has always been full and alive. Because, after a long longing, this longing is now being fulfilled to the fullest.
Today, we performed our Friday Prayer at our Blue Mosque on the occasion of the completion of its restoration and the resumption of service. I wish the completed restoration of our Blue Mosque to be beneficial. On behalf of my nation, I congratulate all those who contributed to this beautiful work, especially my Minister, the General Directorate of Foundations, and the contractor companies.
The Blue Mosque is one of the most important symbols of Istanbul, perhaps even the first. Of course, this is not just a mosque, this is a complex in the literal sense of the word with its madrasah, pavilion, arasta, bath, fountain, fountain and many other units. We need to preserve this region, which is the center of Istanbul, in accordance with its integrity in its establishment. Â It is our foremost duty to protect, protect, revive and keep alive the heirloom artifacts.
What is the opposition saying at the moment? When they came, they were going to abolish the Presidency of Religious Affairs and establish something called the presidency of the place. Brothers; Of course, yuh is not enough, we will work day and night until May 14 and we will turn them into political maws. Can anything else be expected from those who are hand in hand with the terrorist organization? So May 14 should be the end of them. For this reason, during the period of our governments, we have taken care of thousands of ancestral relics within and outside our borders, renewed and revived each of them. We have put the works of our foundations back into service in accordance with their purposes. Hopefully, we will continue these works in the coming period. We will revive all these works both at home and abroad.
It is a different skill to build a beautiful work, it is another skill to restore it to its former beauty after centuries. Look, now we have even dealt with the minarets of Hagia Sophia, we are reviving and building even them. Reason? We said that it would not be enough just to scrape off that negative seal on Hagia Sophia, we took care of it, we opened it after 86 years, but now we will continue our construction work.
The Blue Mosque and its complex is a work of pride, let alone its admirable construction, even its restoration. When we look at these minarets, these rising minarets give us a special pride. Praise be to God, we have carried out a restoration that will leave this trust to new generations in a way that will hopefully live for centuries.
I wish that the prayers to be performed in our mosque, the prayers to be made, the Qur'an to be read, and the hearts that will find peace will be beneficial in advance.
I congratulate those who contributed.
I greet you with love and respect.

Every time we sit at the table of our nation, we strengthen our affection and renew our eternal and eternal brotherhood. On this beautiful Ramadan evening, I would like to thank everyone who brought our hearts together at this beautiful iftar table.
It is a beautiful word; Muhammad became the result of the conversation, what is the result of the conversation without Muhammad. Such a table is such a table of conversation. I wish Ramadan to bring blessings, peace and well-being to our entire nation and all humanity with you.
May Allah bless us from those who know the value of these blessed days. May Allah make Ramadan, the sultan of the 11th month, an occasion for our forgiveness, salvation and purification.
In your person, I would like to congratulate all of Kocaeli on the Leyle-i Kadri and Eid al-Adha, which is better than a thousand months that we will meet on Monday night.
This year, we are taking care to observe Ramadan especially with our earthquake victims. We met with our brothers and sisters who were victims of disasters in Ankara and Istanbul on different occasions. We hosted our search and rescue teams and representatives of our municipalities in our Presidential Complex. We opened our iftars with our brothers and sisters staying in the dormitories of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. We have visited our earthquake-stricken provinces, which we have visited several times before, since Ramadan. We were in Malatya on Thursday and in DiyarbakÄ±r yesterday, we are rapidly laying the foundations of our earthquake houses. I hope we will be in ÅanlÄ±urfa tomorrow.
The number of houses and village houses, the construction process of which started yesterday, reached 100 thousand. God willing, this figure will grow much more with ÅanlÄ±urfa. We will not leave our earthquake victims alone during the holiday, and we will deliver some of the completed village houses.
We are finishing the debris removal works in all our provinces except Hatay until the holiday. As the debris is removed and new constructions rise, we are witnessing that hopes in the earthquake zone are strengthened. Our brothers and sisters, whose homes were destroyed in the disaster, who lost their relatives and whose established order was disrupted, find the courage to start life again when they see these works.
All units of our state, from official institutions to our municipalities, all public personnel from our local administration chiefs to our health professionals, police, architects, all civil society from volunteers to philanthropists, in short, our state and nation are in the field with all their facilities, working on a 24/7 basis.
Other provinces outside the region regularly send aid to our earthquake-stricken provinces. Kocaeli Governorship has shipped a total of 1500 truckloads of aid materials to the region so far. In KahramanmaraÅ, the installation of prefabricated and container bazaars has started on behalf of our province. Our Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality has piled up all its means in the region, from search and rescue teams to fire brigades and construction equipment. It completed the installation of the 54-bed Kocaeli Hospital, which will serve 250 thousand people annually in the Defne district of Hatay, in 20 days.
In order to accelerate the work in the earthquake zone and for this purpose, we declared 7 provinces and 250 municipalities as brothers. In this context, we made Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality sister with Hatay.Â  Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality, in cooperation with our district municipalities, distributes hot meals to 25 thousand people daily in Hatay. In addition, it carries out the installation of container cities and prefabricated buildings. Our municipalities successfully continue their services in a wide range of areas, including the repair of the destroyed infrastructure.
I say God bless everyone, all our institutions and municipalities who pursue work and service instead of advertising and showing.
Hopefully, we will continue to be on the field until the wounds are completely healed and the traces of the earthquake are completely erased. Even if we cannot restore our cities to their former glory and our losses, we will not stop, we will not rest, we will take care of our earthquake victims until we restore our citizens to their former order.
Brothers
As you know, our country has entered the atmosphere of the elections to be held on May 14. There is less than a month left before the ballot box arrives in front of us. As the elections approached, some people started to worry about iqbal again, and started to press all the buttons at the same time. They are trying all kinds of ways, from collaborating with the extensions of the terrorist organization to negotiating behind the scenes with deviant structures. Instead of competing with us in the politics of work and service, they are trying to save the day with absurd promises. Whatever work they have not done in the municipalities they have governed for so many years, which they first promised and then poured concrete on, they heat and heat and bring it to the agenda again.
Look, it has been more than 2 months since the earthquake disaster, and there has been no offer from those who raised the alarm in the first days to cure the problems of our people. Reason? Because they do not have any projects that will give hope to the nation. They do not have any investments in the country in their past. They don't have any artifacts to show as an example by stretching their chests. They have no horizons, no dreams for the future of the country and the nation. They have no vision that will instill hope in our youth. They do not have the capacity and scale to solve Turkey's problems.
Today, we have opened a giant city hospital in Kocaeli, we have opened a magnificent city hospital, and I hope we will open a giant city hospital in Izmir in a few weeks; Don't stop, keep going. Because if these hospitals were not in the covid period, what would be our situation?
They have no story to tell in their political life other than their electoral defeats. So, what is in this alliance of haves and have-nots? There is a lot of disagreement, there is strife, there is a Byzantine game, there is a promise to destroy what has been done, there is a commitment to return Turkey to its old days. Over the course of a year, they held dozens of meetings and hundreds of contacts, but they could not even choose their candidates without a fight. Seven other people sitting around the same table cannot manage each other, and when it comes to words, they talk about governing Turkey of 85 million people. There is nothing they agree on except for distributing positions and positions to someone, but every time they open their mouths, they talk about reconciliation, reconciliation and agreement to solve the problems of the country.
Look what they are distributing to the leaders of each party now. They are handing out a vice presidency. Either they don't know what it is to run a state; Is it possible to govern the state like this? Here's a vice presidency for you, get you a vice presidency; Is this how the state is governed? After that, they talk about waste without shame or boredom; That's the waste itself.
They have only one problem; What is it? To carry out the instruction they received from Qandil. They have only one concern, to walk hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with terrorist organizations as brothers. Aren't these the ones who smuggle the babies of DiyarbakÄ±r mothers into the mountains? Aren't these the ones who massacred 51 of our Kurdish citizens in Diyarbakir? Do you think that man called Selo is Kurdish? No, he is Zaza, not a Kurd, but he is proud of it.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Isn't the child killer in Ä°mralÄ± what they are promising now? What are they saying? We're going to take that out, we're going to take that out, we're going to take this out, we're going to take that out. Will my patriotic nation tell the representatives of this terrorist organization in Parliament to march and pave the way for them? So we will work hard, so we will not stop, and God willing, we will bury them in the ballot box on May 14.
They think that my people have not seen all this, but this nation knows very well what coalition periods mean. And he knows very well what this country paid for at that time. This nation knows very well how political instability can take a heavy toll. My citizen from Kocaeli knows very well what it would cost to surrender to terrorist organizations and to join arms with terrorist organizations. And because he knows, he never puts a premium on such eyewashing. We don't, do we?
Those who underestimate the wisdom, prudence and wisdom of the citizens have always lost, and I hope they will lose again. Imagine, this man, who took away the property of the state in Kocaeli, who never gave everything over the property of the state, is now being brought before my Kocaeli brothers and sisters again as a candidate for deputy, but I hope they will pay a heavy price for this. No matter what political opinion they belong to, no member of our nation will entrust their own or their children's future to such a structure.
They think they can fool our young people who don't know the old days. Youths; You have to ask them to account for the Osman Gazi Bridge. Believe me, they can't even build a wooden bridge, let alone the Osman Gazi Bridge. We built the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, they cannot build a wooden bridge. We built a Marmaray, we did it in spite of them. We built the Eurasia Tunnel, we did it in spite of them.
Youths
We are the grandchildren of Fatih. The conqueror marched the galleys by land. We said that if our ancestor Fatih carried it out from the land, we will carry out Marmaray from under the sea; Have we executed? Executing. We said that that was not enough, let's build a Eurasia Tunnel and a Eurasia Tunnel. It took 7 hours and 15 minutes to go from Istanbul to Izmir, oh my brothers and sisters. What did we do? We reduced it to 3 hours and 15 minutes. Now Istanbul-Izmir is 3 hours and 15 minutes. It belongs to those who know work, to those who wield a sword, they produce words, we produce work.
Now, of course, I would like to remind young people that today's young people know the past, the present and their lungs much better than they do, thanks to the possibilities of technology at their disposal. Hopefully, our young people will get the biggest slap on this table at the ballot box. There are these young people who will take this slap in the face so much that after the election, there will be no one around the table.
Youths; Do you know what they are going to be? It will be a political issue, a political issue, but of course we have to work. We believe that common sense will prevail once again at the ballot box on May 14. With this belief, no matter what the seven-party coalition does, we take care of our business and focus on our main agenda. We never allow the election process to push the problems of our earthquake victims into the background. On the one hand, we are moving disaster victims from tents to containers and prefabricated cities, and on the other hand, we are gearing up our service and work policy.
What have we done with the lowest pension by meeting the demands of our brothers and sisters who are waiting for retirement age? We increased it to 7,500 liras, and we increased the holiday bonuses to 2,000 liras. We are trying to increase the welfare of our people from all walks of life by recruiting contracted personnel who are waiting for staff, giving the good news of new appointments to our teachers and health professionals, and resolutely continuing our fight against the cost of living.
We have finally put TOGG, our domestic and national car, which has been longed for for 60 years, on the road.
We delivered TCG Anadolu, the world's first UCAV ship, to our navy. Now, I hope TCG Anadolu will anchor in Sirkeci and our nation will visit TCG Anadolu there.
Our new unmanned aerial vehicles, which are the world's most advanced products in their fields, are counting the days to fly. We are looking for a place for our growing organized industries all over our country. Thus, we reveal the difference in agenda and mentality between the People's Alliance and the seven-party coalition. Today, we have been proud to bring you many works together with our city hospital.
I wish that all these investments, especially our city hospital with a total capacity of 2,218 beds, will be beneficial to Kocaeli and you, my brothers and sisters. I congratulate everyone who signed these works. On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to thank once again the people of Kocaeli who embraced our earthquake victims.
I pray that our unity, vitality and solidarity will always be eternal. I would like to thank you for your presence at our table. Hoping to meet again, I entrust you to God, stay healthy.

I will now give the floor to the President of Uzbekistan, Mr. Mirziyoyev, to make the closing remarks.
Thanks.

Qatar-Turkey Brotherhood Speech During Their Visit to the Container City,2023-03-12,
Their Speech at Hatay SamandaÄ Disaster Coordination Center,2023-03-12,"

Dear Samandag people,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I wish you a speedy recovery for the earthquakes that we experienced as a country on February 6 and then continued with thousands of tremors.
I wish God's mercy on our citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake, patience and condolences to their relatives, and let's recite a Fatiha to their souls.
Hatay is the city where this disaster, whose effects are felt in a wide area, causes the most burning and loss of life. Words are not enough to describe the dimensions of the disaster that shook many of our districts from Antakya to SamandaÄ. The fact that this earthquake, which is defined as the disaster of the century, was also in the days of harsh winter conditions, increased our problems even more.
Additional problems were the closure of Hatay Airport, whose runway was damaged, the damage to the roads, and the difficulty of communication in the first days. Despite this, as a state and a nation, we have worked hard to reach Hatay and the entire earthquake zone from the first moment of the disaster. Those of our public servants in the city who were able to work were already back at work. Our teams, who set out to reach here from other places, came to Hatay one by one after a lot of struggle.
Due to the high number of collapsed buildings and the limited number of search and rescue personnel, our teams carried out the interventions by racing against time. From AFAD to our miners, from our municipalities to non-governmental organizations, we have reached 35 thousand people, which is an unprecedented number of search and rescue in the world, with our own personnel and international teams. Half of these teams also served in Hatay. With other support personnel, 271 thousand officials worked in the earthquake zone. Volunteers and members of non-governmental organizations and nearly half a million people rushed to the aid of our earthquake victims.
By embezzling each settlement destroyed in the earthquake to our 3 and 5 municipalities, we evaluated their infrastructure and power here. We brought all the tools and devices needed from all over our country to the region. However, despite all efforts, there were places where we could not reach on time in the first days. Despite the vastness of the disaster area and the magnitude of the destruction, no one should doubt that all the resources of the state and the nation have been mobilized for the earthquake zone. We mobilized our soldiers, police, gendarmerie, health workers, educators, personnel of all relevant institutions, and all our vehicles, from planes to helicopters and ships, for our earthquake victims. Our nation, 85 million people, has become one heart for their brothers and sisters here. All of this is well known to our 14 million people living in 11 cities in the earthquake zone.
There is no country that will react faster than Turkey in the face of such a disaster in which the number of deaths has reached 48 thousand, the injured have exceeded 115 thousand, and 50 thousand buildings have been destroyed. This is said by foreigners who come to our country. Moreover, the search and rescue and aid efforts carried out were accompanied by uninterrupted tremors, some of which were the size of independent earthquakes.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate all public personnel, volunteers, civil society members and international teams who took part in these self-sacrificing and heroic works.
With the regularization of the works, first the search and rescue activities and then the debris removal efforts accelerated. In the meantime, the necessary mechanisms for the provision of permanent accommodation centers and emergency food and clothing needs have been established and made operational. The aid materials that our nation poured down from all over the country started to be delivered to the earthquake victims in a certain order. From tents to dormitories, from schools to hotels, from the facilities provided to those who will go to other regions to container cities, every available opportunity was evaluated.
Since the continuation of the aftershocks inevitably disturbed our citizens whose houses were intact or slightly damaged, there was a lot of departure from the region. Those who had a village went to their villages, those who had relatives and friends in other places went to them, and those who requested them went to the shelter centers provided by the state and waited for the earthquake storm to subside.
Of course, in the meantime, we immediately rolled up our sleeves for the construction of permanent housing. In the places where the location was determined and the ground and survey works were completed, we quickly laid the foundations and started to work. We have seen that we need approximately 650 thousand houses with the inclusion of moderately damaged ones. We continue on our way with a plan that will complete the construction of 244 thousand houses and 75 thousand village houses, which are urgently needed, within a year. The number of houses we will build in Samandag is 17 thousand 331. We will continue our construction and revival activities until we provide all of our people with solid, safe and peaceful housing.
We will take the necessary steps at the first opportunity to ensure that the difficulties we have experienced in this regard in the past do not repeat themselves. In all these studies, Hatay and its districts, which suffered the most destruction and loss of life in the earthquake, will be at the top of our priorities.
Brothers
Disasters are also tests in which nations test their unity, solidarity, brotherhood, solidarity, ability and resilience. Thankfully, Turkey has come out of the test of the February 6 earthquakes with a clear mind. Apart from a few small incidents, bad noises and provocation attempts that can be seen in every period, we have healed the wounds of the disaster we have experienced by joining our hearts and hands, and we have turned our direction back to our common future. The importance of a strong state, a nation that can be united in pride and concern is better understood in such periods. For this, we must more firmly protect the framework of trust, peace and prosperity offered to us by the Republic of Turkey, the first century of which we have left behind.
Despite all the disasters and attacks we have experienced, we have countless reasons to look to our future with hope. On the other hand, those who want to pit us against each other over our differences are coming at us with greater ambition than ever. As a nation, we have the resilience to break all of these traps with the strength we derive from our thousand-year-old brotherhood. It is time to throw away the games that have been played in our geography for centuries, and to write, direct and exhibit our own plays.
We are determined to make the new century of our Republic the century of Turkey by pursuing our dreams, building our own vision, and implementing our own programs. This will be the greatest legacy we will leave to our children.
Without allowing the slightest concession from the steps we have taken to turn global crises into opportunities, I hope we will achieve victory in this struggle together with you. Turkey's growth, strengthening, development and enrichment are in the interest of everyone in the region as well as its own citizens.Â  We will continue to be there for our brothers and sisters who support us with their prayers whenever they need us.
With these feelings, I pray that God will protect our country from all kinds of accidents, troubles, disasters and hostilities. Once again, I greet you with love and respect, with good health.
By the way, a brother of mine just made a request about the completion of the Karachay Dam here. As soon as I return, I will give the necessary instructions regarding the Karachay Dam to my Minister of State Hydraulic Works, Mr. Vahit, and I hope the end will be good.
Thank you, be present.

"Speech After Visiting the Field Hospital in Defne, Hatay",2023-03-12,"

Dear Beautiful People of Laurel,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Due to the February 6 earthquakes, which are described as the disaster of the century, and the tremors that followed, I wish you, our entire nation, a speedy recovery.
I wish God's mercy on our citizens who lost their lives in the earthquake and my condolences to their relatives. Al-Fatiha for the soul of them all.
There are very few earthquakes in the world that cause such great destruction in such a wide area. In addition to the unique beauties and generous opportunities of its geography, Turkey is a country that has to undertake such privileges. Unfortunately, the efforts we carry out to prepare our country for disasters cannot progress at the pace we desire due to the problems caused by past negligence and deficiencies. Hopefully, as a nation and a state, we will carry out these preparations more quickly and effectively in the light of the lessons we have learned from the February 6 earthquakes.
Hatay is the place where we experienced the most destruction and lost the most lives from this earthquake disaster. Our Defne, which has been one of the most popular settlements of humanity throughout history, also suffered great damage in this disaster. The 6.5 magnitude earthquake centered in Defne on February 20, about 2 weeks after the disasters centered in KahramanmaraÅ, further increased the destruction in our district. Due to the bad weather conditions in the first days of the earthquake, damaged infrastructure, closed roads and other reasons, the works could be carried out with great difficulty. Overcoming the obstacles in front of us with perseverance and determination, we streamlined all activities in Hatay, from search and rescue to relief efforts, within a few days.
We made our first visit to Hatay on the 3rd day of the earthquake, saw the situation on site and gave the necessary instructions. Today, we are visiting Hatay for the 3rd time and following the work carried out step by step, and as the People's Alliance, we are here again with Mr. BahÃ§eli. Hopefully, we will continue to stand by Hatay with our hearts, eyes and visits.
We are now in the process of removing the debris and constructing the new buildings. We will complete this process by rebuilding every destroyed building in a way that will not victimize a single citizen. By Allah's leave, we plan to rebuild Hatay and its districts within a year. While we start to build permanent housing, we do not neglect the problems of mobile and temporary housing. In the first place, we tried to solve this problem with tents, now we are building container cities. Our field hospital, which we visited, was also built with a container system. Hopefully, we will put 30 thousand containers into service only in Hatay in a short time. We will install most of the 10 thousand containers donated by our sister country Qatar in Hatay, some of them have started operating in Antakya. Our aim is to provide our people with the opportunity to live in relatively more humane conditions until their permanent housing is built.
We immediately rolled up our sleeves for the reconstruction and revival of our cities. Within a year, we will build 319,000 houses as houses and village houses and enable our people to move into them. The number of houses we will build only in Defne is 26 thousand 261. According to the current findings, we need to build a total of 650 thousand houses in the earthquake zone. By Allah's leave, we will completely erase the traces of this great disaster in our cities by carrying out construction and revival activities.
We cannot bring back the people we have lost, but it is possible to replace everything that has been destroyed with a better, safer, more developed one; Our government is capable of doing this. We have proven this in many earthquakes so far. We proved this in Van, we proved it in ElazÄ±Ä, Malatya, BingÃ¶l, and even in the earthquake in Izmir. We are a government that has proven these in many flood disasters, flood disasters in Antalya, Manavgat and MuÄla. We are not deterred by these and I hope we will achieve this in the same way within a year. After a year, we will experience the joy of moving to our permanent residences together here.
Do not listen to those who seek sedition and mischief, and do not give an opportunity to those who want to distract us from our efforts to heal the wounds of the earthquake by harming our unity, solidarity and brotherhood. Do not forget that everything comes and goes, leaving only your life, your home, your job, your peace, which is the guarantee of the future of you and your children.
In the same way, you know in Iskenderun, what are we doing humanely by bringing cruiser ships there? At the moment, we have made the owner of the settlement. In addition, we towed two separate ships that produce energy to that region and put it into service by carrying out not only the cabin system but also the education and training there.Â  The whole point is that we should relieve our citizens of their worries as soon as possible, and we have provided them with the opportunity to eat, drink, go to bed and get up in the best way here, and we are continuing this process right now. That's what we're working for, that's what we're fighting for.
May God help and help us all. May Allah protect our country from all kinds of accidents, troubles and disasters.
I greet you once again with love and respect. And we believe in you, and you believe in the People's Alliance, we have never left you alone, we will never leave you alone.
Thank you, thank you.

First of all, I greet you with love and respect.
Gaziantep suffered great destruction along with its districts in the biggest earthquake disaster in our history, centered in KahramanmaraÅ. Yesterday, I visited KahramanmaraÅ, the center of the earthquake, followed by Hatay and then Adana, along with some of its districts.
According to the latest findings, the number of our citizens who lost their lives in the ruins caused by the earthquake reached 14 thousand 14 in total. The number of our wounded is 63 thousand 794. And right now, as we can see right next to us, our debris removal work continues with intense effort. The number of destroyed buildings was determined as 6 thousand 444. In Gaziantep, 944 buildings were destroyed, 1415 of our citizens died and 10 thousand 395 of our citizens were injured. From here, I would like to once again express my best wishes to our citizens in all of our cities affected by the earthquake. I wish God's mercy on my brothers and sisters who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to our wounded.
As the state, we have been in the field with all our institutions since the moment of the earthquake. Our debris removal work continues. In the meantime, as our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, our goal is to hopefully build our houses on the demolished buildings within a year, with the ground plus 3-4, and in addition, we will provide 10 thousand liras in cash aid to our citizens for the transition process, together with the damage assessment to be made. With this financial aid, we want to alleviate this transition process at least a little bit.
Of course, on the one hand, we have container works, on the other hand, we have containers coming from abroad, we have delivered their ship finding-search studies to a certain place and we will distribute the future containers to these 10 provinces. In addition, we continue to work on caravans. In some regions, we will strive to eliminate these problems of our citizens who are in trouble with caravans.
Of course, in the meantime, unfortunately, there are those who turn the process into political abuse. My countrymen, my people, will never tolerate this abuse. Moreover, today, I hope we will announce the Emergency Law in our Parliament regarding the state of emergency for 3 months. As the President, I have taken my step and it has been published in the Official Gazette, and with the vote to be held in the Parliament today, the state of emergency will come into force. What will this bring? This will give the state the opportunity to intervene with a state of emergency against all usurers, sedition groups and mischief groups in Turkey who abuse this process, go to corruption in trade. However, in some places, unfortunately, there are looting efforts in markets and shopping malls. The state will have the opportunity to intervene in these looting activities and efforts with a state of emergency by obtaining this authority from the Parliament.
On behalf of myself, my Cabinet and my nation, I would like to thank all my friends from the press and all my people for showing this sensitivity, for giving us the necessary confidence in this regard, for their help and support.
Do not worry about this: Just as we survived that huge earthquake in Van, how we survived in BingÃ¶l, how we survived those earthquakes in Malatya and Elazig, as well as how we survived the disaster in Izmir and delivered the buildings there quickly and delivered them to their owners, do not despair, we will do this quickly in these 10 provinces and hopefully deliver the houses to their owners.
Thank you very much. Thank you, be present.

Dear Nation,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. Our scientists agree that the probability of major earthquakes in our country, which is located on important fault lines in our region, is increasing. Yes, it is not possible to prevent an earthquake from happening. But it is up to us to take measures to prevent loss of life and property.
Thanks to the preparations we have made in the light of the lessons we have learned from the bitter experiences we have had in the past, we no longer hear the cry of our citizens asking ""Where is this state"" in any disaster. In this context, our Integrated Disaster Management Strategy, which we have created within AFAD, consists of three stages: pre-disaster preparedness and risk reduction, disaster response, and post-disaster recovery.
Within the scope of pre-disaster preparedness and risk reduction studies, we make our cities resistant to disasters with mass housing and urban transformation projects. With our effective management in the event of a disaster, we reach our citizens in a short time and carry out search and rescue operations quickly. With our post-disaster recovery strategy, we are implementing projects that will replace the destroyed with much better ones.
Undoubtedly, you are at the center of everything with your pre-disaster preparations, your correct behavior during the disaster, and your patience after the disaster. For this reason, we declared 2020 as the year of disaster preparedness, 2021 as the year of disaster education, and this year as the year of disaster drills. Last year, we reached nearly 57 million citizens with various educational materials. This year, we have tested our readiness levels with 94,207 drills so far.
Today, on the day and time of the DÃ¼zce earthquake, that is, on November 12 at 18.57, we are conducting a general exercise in 81 provinces and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Our expectation from you is to voluntarily participate in the drill and test the reflexes of yourself and your environment according to a possible earthquake. I believe that with a few minutes to this exercise, we will gain an experience that will add life to our lives together.
At this moment, when our clocks are about to show 18.57, I invite you to hold on to life by saying collapse-close-hold with the understanding that disaster knowledge equals life knowledge.

Dear Ministers,
Distinguished Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I am very pleased to welcome you in Turkey on the occasion of the Second Education Summit. Welcome to our beautiful Istanbul, the crossroads of cultures, civilizations and continents, the pearl of cities. I hope that the summit will be beneficial and I would like to thank all our academicians, professors and experts who contributed to the summit with their valuable ideas. I would like to congratulate the management of the Turkish Maarif Foundation and all our institutions and organizations that contributed to the execution of the summit.
As humanity, we have been facing a challenge that started with the health crisis for the last 2.5 years, and then different dimensions came to light in addition to the economy. The common opinion of our parents, teachers and other stakeholders of education is that the epidemic days have caused serious damage to the education system. In a wide range from reading habits to listening skills, from screen addiction to bilateral relationships, our children are struggling with problems they have never been used to before.
Regardless of the level, we attach importance to the fact that our children continue their education life in a healthy, successful and efficient way. With this understanding, we carry out studies in many areas from improving the educational infrastructure to strengthening our teaching staff, from the implementation of new methods to the development of student skills. Our aim is to have successful, moral and virtuous young people who are equipped, read, research, question, and produce added value that will develop our country and have a say in the world. As Turkey, we call this the TEKNOFEST generation. We are mobilizing all the means of our state to ensure that this generation, to whom we will entrust our future, will grow up not only academically but also spiritually in the most rewarding way.
While doing these in our country, we never neglect our friends and brothers, and we are sensitive to sharing our experience in the field of education. Our Maarif Foundation plays a vital role at this point by successfully representing the values of our nation and universal principles outside our borders. We are proud of our foundation, which sincerely strives to raise good, successful and well-equipped students who wave the education flag of our country in 6 different continents of the world.
I believe that the 2nd Istanbul Education Summit will make meaningful contributions to increasing the efficiency of our foundation's work and to eliminating the damages caused by the pandemic in the education system.
With these thoughts, I wish the summit to be successful and greet you once again with respect.
Stay healthy.

Dear Representatives of the World of Technology,
I greet you with my heartfelt affection at such a meaningful meeting. I hope that the Blockchain Istanbul event, organized by the Information and Communication Technologies Presidency of our AK Party at such a sensitive time, will be beneficial for our country and the technology sector. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the organization of this event and enriched the meeting with their participation.
Like every area of Turkey, I hope there will be the signature of the AK Party under the digital transformation of our country. In fact, it is possible to see the traces of digital transformation behind every work and service we have brought to our country in the past 20 years. While working to complete Turkey's century-old investment deficiencies, we did not neglect to establish a strong technological infrastructure in accordance with the spirit of the times. Of course, technology is an area that has progressed very rapidly in the last 1 century and this speed has increased even more recently. It is imperative that we adapt to this speed. Otherwise, we will not be able to bring our country together with the goals of our 2053 vision.
Among other developments, the fact that we have become a country that produces its own satellites, launches its own space program, develops our internet infrastructure, and expands our electronic government applications are signs of these. We are going a little slow in terms of fiber infrastructure on the Internet, we are aware that we need to speed it up. Hopefully, we will soon be able to take very important steps in this regard.
Undoubtedly, research and development activities are the basis of the gains achieved in technology. Our Lord says, ""There is only as much for a man as he works."" It is possible to see the wisdom of this command mostly in the field of technology. The distance our country has covered in the field of research and development in the last 20 years and the amount of resources it uses are very, very important in terms of showing where we have come from in this regard. We are a country that has increased its research and development expenditures to 55 billion liras, exceeding 1 percent of our national income. The fact that two-thirds of these expenditures are made by the private sector shows that we are moving in a healthy and correct direction.
Again, we are witnessing a similar development in technoparks, which are the cores of technology studies. The number of technoparks, which was 2 when we came to the government, has reached 94, 81 of which are active and 13 of which are in the establishment phase, spread over 59 cities.
The defense industry is both the locomotive of technology and the area where it is used the most. Turkey has increased from 62 defense industry projects to more than 750 projects and from a budget of 5.5 billion dollars to a budget of 75 billion dollars. We observe the most concrete reflection of this development in our exports. We have increased our annual exports of defense industry products, which are 250 million dollars, to over 3 billion dollars. The number of technology companies with a value of over one billion dollars has reached 6.
The 99th anniversary of our Republic. Our TOGG car, which we will hold the unloading ceremony on the anniversary, is one of the symbols of the level our country has reached in technology. In the words of its manufacturers, TOGG, which is a smart device with features far beyond the automobile, will hopefully make significant contributions to our country as a driver of many sectors.
Dear Friends,
Developments in the field of crypto money have made blockchain technology popular with the public. The decentralized registration and assurance opportunities provided by this technology, which has developed greatly in the last 10 years, have the potential to radically change the current commercial system. Alternative business methods, which are newly developed in this field and expressed by concepts that our ears have not yet become accustomed to, have started to enter our lives more and more. A new phase has been entered in the process by securing the intellectual property evaluations of digital content through blockchain technology. If we express it with an analogy; Digital assets are the fuel of technology, and blockchain is the tool of technology. The main issue and feature of this technology that makes it attractive for a wide range of activities ranging from food supply chains to banks, from logistics transactions to works of art is; It is the ability to process quickly, efficiently, securely and cost-effectively.
It is clear that we cannot ignore such a potential while making preparations for the Turkish century. We want to be the country that uses this tool, rather than being the one that puts fuel in the digital asset storage. Instead of trying to take part in the virtual universes opened by others, we seek to establish our own universe. Our goal is; In this field, it is to reach the position of designer, producer, direction, follower, not consumer.
We already know that our country is carefully followed with its achievements that will set an example for the world, especially in the defense industry, as well as other areas of technology. Our unmanned aerial vehicles have become legends for whom songs are composed with the epics they have written. Our aircraft, such as AkÄ±ncÄ±, with more advanced technology and power, have the potential to radically change war strategies around the world. Our Anatolian amphibious assault ship, which will also carry unmanned water vehicles, on which unmanned aerial vehicles can land and take off, is preparing to play a similar role in the seas. We are getting stronger and stronger in this area with our air defense systems, missiles, armored vehicles and many other technological tools.
Just as we have set an example to the world with our innovation, productivity and diligence as well as our courage and determination throughout history, we are demonstrating a similar performance with our technological breakthroughs today. Now we also have Typhoons, and they are now a sign somewhere and they follow them with pleasure, and we are now trying to take them to a much more advanced stage. We believe that we can use this innovative technology, which will add value to our economy, in a wide range of areas, from ensuring the effectiveness of our global humanitarian aid to combating climate change. With this excitement, we are accelerating our work.
Our call for ""The world is bigger than five"", which we have expressed on many platforms, especially on the United Nations rostrum, is an objection that covers not only the field of governance and security, but also justice in technology. Thanks to our young people, whom I call the TEKNOFEST generation, we not only complete our deficiencies quickly, but also put our signature under many innovations around the world. When we look at the last 20 years, today and vision of our country, we can easily see what will happen when the vision of the AK Party and the dynamism and talent of our young people come together.
If you look at which party is on the agenda of everything related to technology in Turkey today, the first and even the only political entity you will come across is the AK Party. Have you heard or seen anything in the name of technology from others? They don't have such a problem. Either you look at what is intertwined with terrorism or they follow what is being done in terrorist areas. While establishing our new management system, we also included a special office called the Digital Transformation Office within the Presidency. We are evaluating tomorrow, not today, what will happen tomorrow? How are we going to organize our digital world? We have demonstrated the steps of all these when we established this new presidential system.
As the President and Chairman, we pay special attention to taking part in the technology-related programs of both our institutions and our party. Just a few days ago, we were at the E-Ä°nsan Project promotion ceremony. In March, I participated in the metaverse event organized by our Information and Communication Technology Presidency. We definitely take part in every TEKNOFEST festival. I closely monitor every stage of our TÃ¼rksat satellites until they are put into service. I personally open technology centers in various cities. We definitely take part in the ceremonies of our institutions that reward studies in the field of technology, especially TÃBÄ°TAK. Most of the works we have brought to our country are also wonders of technology. As a manifestation of the same understanding, we are making this evaluation and this statement in this magnificent hall and in the most important university of our Istanbul.
This event, which will bring together international participants with the leading representatives of our public and private sectors, is an indication of our country's close follow-up of technological innovations. In fact, anticipating these days, we also assigned the National Electronics and Cryptology Research Institute within TÃBÄ°TAK for blockchain technology studies. The first laboratory of our country in this field was established there in 2016. A study on crypto money is being carried out within our Central Bank. Our other ministries are also closely following this technology in their areas of responsibility. We also closely monitor the activities of our private sector in the field of blockchain technology. In the coming period, we will continue to implement new projects that will contribute to our country in this field with our public institutions, universities and private sector.
Our aim is to ensure that all administrative, technical and strategic aspects of blockchain technology are discussed in a way that sheds light on our business sectors with this event. Without recognizing the opportunities we have in all its dimensions, we cannot evaluate the opportunities and threats, and therefore we cannot take healthy steps towards creating the necessary infrastructure and making arrangements. As the concept of cyberspace expands into cyberspace, it is our duty to make preparations that will put Turkey ahead of the times in this field as well as other issues.
I advise our young people to take part in the development of innovations such as blockchain technology and turn to larger and more prosperous channels instead of turning to cryptocurrency gambling, which has no basis.
With these feelings, I once again wish our event to be beneficial, and I congratulate my Vice President, his team and all those who contributed to this work on behalf of myself and my nation.
I greet you all with love and respect, with good health.

Dear Heads of Government,
Distinguished Participants,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings on behalf of myself, my country and my nation. The 6th Session of the Conference on Cooperation and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia. I am very pleased to participate in the Summit.
I would like to congratulate all my Kazakh brothers and sisters in the person of President Tokayev for their successful Presidency and hosting this great summit. I would like to welcome Kuwait, which has just been admitted as a member. The 30th edition of the conference, the foundations of which were laid in line with the proposal of Kazakhstan. We are fortunate to celebrate the anniversary of its establishment at this summit organized by Kazakhstan. I hope that our summit and the consultations we will hold will be beneficial for our countries and all humanity.
The main goal of our Asia Anew Initiative, which we announced in 2019; deepening our cooperation with the countries of the continent on bilateral and regional platforms. From the very beginning, we have strongly supported the expansion of the conference, of which we are one of the founders, and the expansion of institutional capacity. During our Presidency between 2010 and 2014, we acted in the same direction. Today's Astana Summit will go down in history as the summit where the process of transforming the Conference into an international organization was announced.
Dear Friends,
As humanity, we are going through a period in which the balance of power has changed, there have been breaks in supply chains, and we have faced serious tests in many areas from economy to food security, from energy to international relations. New problems such as climate change, Islamophobia and xenophobia are being added to the problems we are familiar with, such as terrorism, racism and migration. The structural problems of the current system, which protects the interests of countries with no more than five fingers on one hand, but ignores the vast majority of the world's population, are increasingly felt. As Turkey, we have been drawing attention to this situation for a long time by saying ""The world is bigger than five"". We believe that the global security architecture should be shaped with a new understanding that is more just, equitable and representative.
No matter where we are in the world, we all share the same fate as members of the great human family. What we have experienced during the pandemic has reminded us of this fact again. Just as our problems are common, we must seek and find solutions together with a common mind. As Turkey, we value the ideas of our friends and we are sensitive to sharing our experience and knowledge. With this understanding, we carry out the coordination of the new challenges and threats priority area within the conference.
On the other hand, terrorist organizations continue their efforts to develop asymmetric threats in the face of counter-terrorism measures. Terrorist organizations such as FETÃ, DAESH, PKK support their actions with organized crime activities. Formations that aid these terrorist organizations and participate in propaganda, financing and recruitment activities must be prevented without any discrimination. In this respect, I consider the action plan of the conference that we will adopt today on the implementation of the United Nations strategy to combat global terrorism as an important achievement.
Dear Participants,
The establishment of peace and stability in Afghanistan is of great importance in terms of preventing irregular migration movements and increasing terrorist activities, as well as our humanitarian duty towards our Afghan brothers and sisters. We should not abandon Afghanistan to its fate, and we should continue our support as the international community in humanitarian aid.
As TÃ¼rkiye, we delivered our humanitarian aid, which we prioritize in our foreign policy, to 120 countries in 2021. With a total of 5.6 billion dollars of humanitarian aid, we rank first in the world in this field compared to national income. We continue to host more than 4 million displaced people, including 3.7 million Syrians under temporary protection.
We are all feeling the effects of the crisis in Ukraine on a regional and global scale. I always say that a just peace can be achieved through diplomacy, that there will be no winners in a war and no losers in a just peace.
On the other hand, our intensive efforts with the United Nations and the parties to eliminate the negative effects of the war have won the appreciation of the whole world. The Istanbul Agreement on the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea and the prisoner exchange last month are concrete achievements in this direction. Our goal is to maintain the momentum despite the difficulties on the field and to stop the bloodshed as soon as possible.
Dear Friends,
It is in our common interest to strengthen the transportation links of Central Asian countries with the surrounding geographies. As Turkey, we promote multimodal transport corridors and support the revival of the modern Silk Road connecting Asia and Europe. In this context, I attach great importance to our initiative for the east-west middle corridor with the Caspian passage and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, which is the backbone of the middle corridor. In the last 15 years, we have implemented more than 100 major infrastructure projects worth $100 billion to strengthen international connections. This year, we also co-coordinated the trade and investments priority area of the conference.
The issue of sustainable energy and ensuring energy security has once again been at the top of the agenda all over the world. Resource and route diversification is one of the main objectives of our energy policy. Another important dimension of this is the transition to clean energy, which is also on the agenda of all of us.
Environmental problems such as global warming, destruction of biodiversity, desertification, and natural disasters are the most important challenges of the century. Therefore, I see the environmental dimension of the catalogue of confidence-building measures as one of the most important areas of activity of the conference.
The declaration of intent on global waste management, signed by Secretary-General Guterres on the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly in September, together with my wife Emine ErdoÄan, is almost a roadmap for the international community.
Dear Friends,
I am very pleased that today's summit will mark the beginning of the transformation of the conference into an international organization. I congratulate the Chairman-in-Office Kazakhstan for its guiding and decisive approach to this transformation process. I have no doubt that all member states will give maximum support to the transformation process.
I hope that our summit will be beneficial and I greet you once again with respect.

TÃGVA 6. Addresses to Young People Before the Youth Meeting,2022-10-09,"

Dear Youth;
Right now, Sinan Erdem Indoor Sports Hall is packed, you are outside right now because you can't get in. But you already have a place in our hearts right now. Alhamdulillah, TÃGVA has more than 310 thousand members throughout Turkey. TÃGVA's position is very important in preparing our youth for the future as a religious generation by getting better and more beautiful every day with all its structuring in 81 provinces. Here you are in front of me as the representatives of this generation. Therefore, we are making all kinds of sacrifices as our Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of National Education and the President, 17 ministries, and we will continue to do so.
Now Basaksehir wants to take the lead, of course, I believe that all of the young people here carry the root of the spirit that Basaksehir carries. And there is no separate informal here. Our only concern is to raise this youth, whom we see as AsÄ±m's generation, to the most advanced and extreme points with that spirit. Here's what we said about him:
""Who said I am meek, my meek sheep,
Maybe it will be cut, but my neck won't be pulled.
When I see a bleeding wound, my liver burns,
To appease him, I eat whips, I eat doubles,
I can't say don't mind the man, go late, I'll mind
I trample and trample and lift up the Truth
I am the enemy of the oppressor, but I love the oppressed.""
Here is which country is currently playing the role of mediator in the war between Russia and Ukraine? Turkey. And is Turkey worn out by all these events? Quite the contrary. Everyone in Europe is on fire right now, what will this winter be like? Alhamdulillah, we have made all our preparations and with all our preparations, Alhamdulillah, we have prepared natural gas, coal, everything for our nation. And our problem is how we will deliver this natural gas to our citizens at more affordable prices, we are in an effort to do so.
But I want you to know this: The AK Party government does not consent to persecution, it never wants to be persecuted. As of now, our concern is to increase the minimum wage to the most appropriate figure with the new evaluations to be made in December. That's what we're here for. We will take care of a Turkey where there is no corruption, no bribery, no poverty by Allah's leave, we will do it, and as of now, we are preparing for it.
Youths
Did you find your books on the desks when the schools opened? Have you found your supplementary textbooks? How did this happen? Was there such a thing before this?
We have come and gone from these times. We couldn't find books from stationery stores, we couldn't find books, notebooks. But we had this trouble, what did we say? Our children should not suffer. Let's build the most ideal schools for them, prepare our desks accordingly, and let our children go to school in a very peaceful way, make their preparations at this point and spend the whole semester in the best way and comfortably.
Now, with this prayer and wish, I want to keep the young people in the hall waiting any longer, and I send you my heartfelt greetings and love on behalf of myself and my fellow ministers.
I pray that God will help us. I entrust you to Allah.

Dear people of Ankara,
Dear Youth,
Dear Mayors,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and longing and affection. Â From here, I send my greetings and love to our young people all over our country, to all young hearts who dream for Turkey and pursue these dreams. Welcome to our Youth Festival organized by the AK Party Local Governments Presidency.
Last year, we held the first edition of the festival, which we called the Festival Just for Me, and we received great appreciation from our young people. I am very pleased to be with you at the second edition of our festival, which was attended by 2 million young people last year. I wish our festival to be beneficial to the people of Ankara, our municipalities, our youth and all our citizens. Our Capital National Garden will host approximately 300 events over the next five days. In this beautiful area, a wide range of programs ranging from concerts to cinema and theater performances, from conversations to gastronomy, from author meetings to conferences will be held.
In addition to having fun, our young people will have the opportunity to see and learn about the work of AK Party municipalities about them. Within the scope of the festival, we bring together the stands and activities of 150 municipalities with a population of over 100 thousand with our young people and citizens. Thus, we bring together our mayors and young people from all corners of our country and provide them with the opportunity to follow the agenda of the youth. Last year's festival was really productive in this respect. We received positive reactions from everyone, especially our young people who participated in the festival. In line with your recommendations, we have further increased the number of services we offer through our municipalities. We have developed boutique projects for our young people. Our Local Administrations Presidency is in constant contact with our young people.
Our Headquarters Youth Branches are working day and night with the aim of reaching all our brothers and sisters, especially our 6 million young people who will vote for the first time this year. Our Ministry of Youth and Sports commissions many investments, works and services that will make your life easier, meet your needs and produce solutions to your problems. We are mobilizing all our means to serve you better with the political institution, civil society and official institutions. As we have done for the last 20 years, we do this by taking your ideas and consulting with our young people. Hopefully, I believe that this year's festival will be successful in every aspect.
I would like to congratulate our municipalities and mayors to whom we will give the awards of the Local Governments and Youth Projects Competition within the scope of the festival. From here, I invite all our young people in our country to this beautiful festival where they can have fun, learn and have a productive time.
Dear Youth,
You are not only the future of your families, but also the future of our country. You are the guarantee of our bright future. You are the architects of a great and powerful Turkey.
I am an elder who started politics at a very early age in the Youth Branches. Throughout my political life of more than 40 years, I have always walked the road with young people. I have always kept your companionship and companionship on my head. At a time when Turkey was struggling with instability, we paved the way to the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality with our young people. We served Istanbul with a young and dynamic team for 4.5 years until we were dismissed because of a poem we read. Our young people were at the forefront of the apocalyptic crowd that saw us off on our way to PÄ±narhisar.
In 2021, when we set out on a new path, we established the AK Party, the hope of the nation, together with our young people. We have relied on young people in all of our governments, in our Parliamentary Group, in the management levels of our party, we have benefited from your enthusiasm, and we have brought new faces to Turkish politics. We have included young people in all decision-making processes. While the opposition said, ""You will fill the parliament with children"", we showed our trust in you by lowering the age of election of our young people to 18, just like the election.
Today, many of our young brothers and sisters serve our country and nation with love as deputies, ministers or bureaucrats. The presence and weight of our young entrepreneurs in our business world is increasing day by day. Our young people play a leading role not only in academia, politics and trade, but also in every field from the defense industry to advanced technology. Despite someone's attempts to imprison our young people in various letters, the youth of TEKNOFEST are coming with a bang. We are proud of your achievements, your self-confidence that does not fit into patterns, letters and templates. Hopefully, we will build the century of Turkey together with you.
Dear Youth,
Those who did not look back at the faces of the young people after the election day passed, suddenly remembered the young people when the ballot box appeared on the horizon. When we see our young people, we follow with caution the funny situations that those who are looking for a way to change them are now putting themselves in in the name of reaching young people. Mr. Kemal, who made a statement about the headscarf in the middle of the night, then said that we will not vote for the constitutional amendment today. These are liars, liars, there is no honesty in them. If you are sincere, if you are honest, we don't need a change in the law, let's make a constitutional amendment. They can't, they can't, because they're not honest.
Those who have not taken a single step for the good of our young people so far are now questioning and taking them into account by asking if they are with me. In group meetings, we line up young people and watch the roll call areas with our faces flushed. We trust the youth of this country without even taking these indignities, which are signs of distrust and underestimation of young people, a fortress. Despite all this, we believe in you, and we do not leave this belief only in words like others, but we clearly demonstrate this belief with our actions, reforms, legal arrangements, and the works and services we do for you.
Look, we spent our youth in a really difficult period when our country was struggling with instability, terrorism, social and economic crises. In those days when our hearts were moving, we experienced many troubles, from street fights to coups, from backwardness to poverty. Unfortunately, while they were in the prime of their lives, many of our friends, many young values of this country were wasted. With ideologies imported from abroad, impenetrable walls have died between our young people by calling them Turkish-Kurdish, Sunni-Alevis, rightist-leftist. They lured our youth, whom they deceived with the traps they set in the hotbeds of strife disguised as political parties, to the warlords of the separatist terrorist organization. Then they gave weapons to the hands of these sons of ours who should hold pens and unleashed them on our country and nation.
In the same way, in the days when the February 28 mentality descended on Turkey like a nightmare, we had young people whose lives were darkened and darkened. Thankfully, these dark days are over, when our girls' rights to education were usurped under unfair, unlawful and arbitrary pretexts, and our young people were marginalized because of their hair, beard and dress.
You were born in AK Party Turkey, you studied in AK Party Turkey, you grew up in AK Party Turkey. You did not face the prohibitions, fascism, oppression and bullying that your parents were subjected to. Thank God you did not live through those ominous days when persuasion rooms were set up at the university gates and basic human rights were seen as a luxury. With the appreciation of our nation, our biggest goal since the day we took office in 2002; to make you live in a prosperous, strong and free Turkey in all respects.
Youths; Of course, we have paid the price, we have endured difficulties, we have been attacked by many groups from tutelage to terrorist organizations, but we have never allowed anyone to return this country to its bad old dark days. Despite the opposition standing guard at the door of the Constitutional Court to annul every step we have taken regarding rights and freedoms, we have saved our country's democracy from its shame. Because we do not have a single night, a single day, not a single young person at this point to lose, regardless of their origin, profession, sect or political opinion.
Now, are you ready? Young people, are you ready? Are you ready?
One nation... One flag... One homeland... One state...
We will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey together.
I entrust you to Allah. Thank you, be present.

Dear Nation,
Dear people of Ankara,
Dear representatives of our health community, dear brothers and sisters; I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I wish our Etlik City Hospital to be beneficial to our Ankara, our country and our nation. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate our Ministry of Health, contractor companies, and everyone from workers to engineers, who contributed to bringing the second city hospital to Ankara.
We see our Etlik City Hospital as one of the symbols of our health revolution with its 8 separate hospitals and units equipped with the latest technology. As mentioned before, this giant hospital is almost a health city with a capacity of more than 4 thousand beds, 691 of which are intensive care, 1000 polyclinics, 125 operating rooms, laboratories, research centers and an area of more than 1 million 145 thousand square meters. This suits Ankara, and therefore it suits the people of Ankara. Our hospital is designed with equipment that will provide the highest comfort not only to our citizens but also to its employees.
I would like to reiterate that we have always stood by our healthcare personnel, whose problems we have solved to a significant extent and whose expectations we have met with the packages we have announced one after the other since March, with the white reform we have implemented. Â Last weekend, I had the opportunity to chat with our medical staff at BaÅakÅehir Ãam and Sakura City Hospital in Istanbul and listen to their satisfaction in person. I wish success to our healthcare personnel who will work in this proud Etlik City Hospital.
Dear Guests,
When we came to government 20 years ago, we promised our nation that we would elevate our country in terms of education, health, justice and security. Then, we promised that we would be the world's leading country in transportation, agriculture, energy, diplomacy, foreign policy. Etlik City Hospital, which we have opened, is one of the examples that we have fulfilled this promise. Of course, we did not only establish Etlik City Hospital in Ankara, but also established Bilkent of the same size. Again, this is 4050 rooms and beds, and this is also 4050 rooms and beds. These hospitals are exemplary in the world. Turkey has been longing for this for years. Have we achieved this? Will we succeed? Thanks.
As you know, I personally followed each and every stage of the city hospitals, which I saw as my dream. Like every dream of our nation, I am very fortunate and proud to present the 20th work of this common dream to service today. Yes, today Turkey has its 20th city hospital. Hopefully, we will increase this number to 35 with our 13 city hospitals currently under construction and 2 city hospitals in the project phase.
Some of our city hospitals are implemented with public-private partnerships, as in Etlik, and some of them are implemented from the general budget. Whatever we can provide to our nation with the most efficient, most effective, fastest and highest standard service, we put that method into use. Although the opposition tries to throw mud at these works with delusions, most of which are lies and distortions, the city hospital model, which was implemented in our country for the first time in the world, is being closely examined by many countries today. During the epidemic period, it has been revealed how deplorable the developed countries, whose infrastructures have become obsolete and insufficient, are in a pitiful state in terms of health. So much so that many countries have become so desperate to provide health services over the phone and have left their citizens to die. We all know very well the disgraceful scenes in the name of humanity reflected from hospitals and elderly care homes at that time.
Brothers
Have you watched the program of War Moon? Did you see the misery of Mr. Kemal as the head of the Social Insurance Institution? Will any good come to this country from Mr. Kemal? What did you do at the head of the Social Insurance Institution, and what are you going to do in this country? Turkey has left this epidemic behind as a country that provides the highest level of health services, thanks to both the existing, widespread and strong health infrastructure and the city hospitals we have rapidly commissioned. We managed the biggest health crisis of the last century without leaving our nation in need of makeshift structures advertised by the opposition as field hospitals. What did this CHP do? You know the state of affairs in Adana, don't you? They tried to invade my nation as a city hospital, and Mr. Kemal went to inaugurate it without being embarrassed or bored. Is this a hospital, can it be a hospital out of a tent? But if you ask Mr. Kemal, it will be, because that's how his life went.
While providing first-class health care to our own citizens, we have also sent medical aid to 161 countries and 12 international organizations. Today, we have become the global star of health with our doctors whose skills and hard work are appreciated by everyone in our public and private hospitals, which are at a level that can compete with the world, our infrastructure that increases the quality of service, and our qualified staff. Of course, as with every major reform and every major change, there may be minor setbacks in this area.
Brothers
But now this ship has taken its cargo, is on its course and is heading towards its range. We cannot allow any negativity that will harm our country's achievements in the field of health. On the contrary, we will use the opportunities we have more efficiently and continue on our way with steps that will carry them forward. In particular, we will do whatever it takes to increase the patient and employee satisfaction of our city hospitals to strengthen their academic qualifications. By combining our human capital with technological opportunities at the highest level, we will make each of our city hospitals a brand at national and international level. We will accelerate the branding process by supporting every doctor, assistant and teacher who joins our health army in terms of academic status and personal rights. By working harder together, producing more, following the world better, and improving ourselves better, we will hopefully bring our country together with the 2053 health vision.
The most important legacy we will leave to our young people is to instill in them the spirit and opportunity to make their dreams come true in every field, especially in health. We will not stop until we build a Turkey that is so developed that every one of our citizens, but especially our young people, will not envy anything in other countries. Okay, we're not going to stop. Turkey does not have a single child that it can afford to lose. On the contrary, each of our people is valuable and valuable for us, our country and our nation with their potential, energy and talent. We will not allow anyone to take this precious treasure away from us. We cannot allow anyone to commit acts that will squander the country's savings and jeopardize the future of our nation. Especially at a time when global governance mechanisms are being reconstructed, we can never afford such a catastrophe.
Look at what a sultan of the heart says: ""Advice will not profit from those who do not remove the cotton of heedlessness from the ear of comprehension."" Of course, all this means something to those who have an open ear of understanding. For this reason, I sincerely believe that our nation will make the right decision for the Turkish century by seeing the difference that the picture in front of it points to it with its wisdom and wisdom, as it has done so far. Brothers; Don't forget that the name of this century is the century of Turkey.
Dear Guests,
In the coronavirus epidemic, our world has seen both the value of the opportunities it has and how fragile the welfare order is through its weaknesses. The Russia-Ukraine War has also been instrumental in observing the vulnerabilities in the world's security order, with its dimensions ranging from threats to use nuclear weapons.
When we put our country at the center, there is a climate of unrest caused by security crises and instability on all sides from west to east, from north to south. Despite all the attacks it has been exposed to and all the troubles it has experienced, Turkey stands out from this worrying picture as an island of trust and peace. For a long time, there has been a segment of people who have lamented our own shortcomings, flaws and inadequacies by comparing them with developed countries. Even the late Mehmet Akif has poems in which he expresses his envy for the science, technique and science of the West. Regardless of the radical ideology they belong to, the fact that those who left our country always turned their direction to the West has taken its place in our history as a fact despite the inconsistency in itself.
Recently, we see that developed countries have been beautified on social media channels, and especially the subconscious of our young people are trying to instill the idea that they should go to these places. Let's first answer these questions in the language of Cemil MeriÃ§, one of the greatest thinkers our country has raised in recent times; ""Those who find their homeland uninhabitable are those who make their homeland uninhabitable."" Yes, as Cemil MeriÃ§ said, those who try to portray Turkey as such are actually the ones who do all kinds of insidious things to make the country what it is. Leaving aside the colonial order behind the current wealth of developed countries, the history of blood, brutality and robbery, the secret mansion of security and prosperity, which are the most important hallmarks of these countries, cracks and breaks a little more with every global crisis.
This harsh reality has a role in Turkey's transformation into a refuge not only for those fleeing war zones, but also for citizens of developed countries. Anatolia is perhaps the only geography in the world where the oppressed and victims coming from all directions for centuries have been accepted only with human qualities. Today, we host millions of people from all over the world. Everyone who sees our country as a gate of salvation or a passageway to this land is actually giving us a very important message. My brothers and sisters, we should know very well the value of the land we live in, our homeland, our state, our country and the nation we belong to.
We only need to look up to see what disasters have befallen those who have lost their homeland and whose states have been destroyed. Woe to you if you are not a member of a nation that will surround you in your difficult days and share its bread, vaccine and water when necessary. Despite this, the aim of those who still beautify other countries, other societies and other forms of charity is not to do us good as individuals, but on the contrary, to collapse our social structure, which is our greatest strength.
Brothers
In particular, we look with pity at those who arrive at the doors of other countries, other societies, just because they want to get into a better car, buy a newer phone, go to more concerts. We can imagine the regret that those who set out with such enthusiasm today will experience when they cannot find a family, a social structure, a state mechanism to take refuge in when they need mercy and compassion tomorrow.
Every new global crisis, every new challenge, every new chaos will continue to shake the existing security and prosperity order that serves only a fraction of the world's people. As Turkey, we will hopefully overcome this great transformation with the least trouble and great gain by believing, trusting and relying on our own belief, our own strength, our own ability, our own potential, and then the value, value and unique blessings of this country will be better understood. The important thing is to firmly protect our unity, solidarity and brotherhood, to take our country forward and to strengthen our state continuously until the day we see this. We see every work and service we bring to our country as a tool that serves this purpose. I believe that our Etlik City Hospital will constitute an important stage in the construction of a great and strong Turkey with the contributions it will make to our country and the services it will provide to our nation.
Brothers
See, while we are taking this step here today, we have built Ãam Sakura in Istanbul, a magnificent hospital. We didn't stay with him, we built GÃ¶ztepe City Hospital, we didn't stay with him in the same way in OkmeydanÄ±, yes, we built a city hospital there as well. We didn't stop there, we built Kartal City Hospital, Sancaktepe City Hospital and YeÅilkÃ¶y city hospitals, especially YeÅilkÃ¶y and Sancaktepe, in 45 days, this is who we are.
With these feelings, I once again wish our hospital to be beneficial.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank our Ministry, the contractor company, the architect and the engineer, all my worker brothers and sisters, who contributed to bringing this beautiful work to Ankara.
I wish our doctors and medical staff success in their work in this modern hospital.
I greet you with love and respect, with good health.

Dear ÃskÃ¼dar residents,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Dear Guests;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection, assalamu alaikum wa mercy and blessings, peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you. Have a blessed Friday. I hope that the restoration of our 261-year-old Ayazma Mosque, where we have just performed the Friday Prayer together, will be beneficial for our country and the world, Islam.
I commemorate with mercy everyone who has made an effort to keep this work alive from Sultan Mustafa III, the founder of our Ayazma Mosque, which adds value to our city with its architecture, location and many features.
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the restoration of the mosque.
Our Lord says in Surah al-Tawba: Only those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, perform the prayer properly, give zakat and fear no one but Allah will build the mosques of Allah.
I wish that the call to prayer to be recited 5 times a day in the Ayazma Mosque, the prayers to be performed and the prayers to be made will be accepted in the sight of Allah, as it has been until today.
We see each of our mosques, which echo the skies of our cities with their prayers, as spiritual guardians erected on the homeland for the future of our country and nation. By reopening Hagia Sophia for worship, we protected the relics of the conquest and its Victorious Commander Fatih. With the mosques we have built all over Istanbul recently, we have diversified, multiplied and disseminated the seals engraved by our ancestors on these lands. We are in peace of mind that we have fulfilled another duty by completing the restoration of the Ayazma Mosque and opening it for worship again. I pray that the prayers and worship to be made here will be accepted by God.
I greet you with love and respect, with good health.

"Speech at the Award Ceremony of Those Who Add Value to Kocaeli, the Center of Industry and Technology",2022-08-06,"

Dear Beautiful People of Kocaeli,
Dear Representatives of Our Business World,
Dear Brothers and Sisters of Workers,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, affection and longing. I am pleased to be with you at the Kocaeli Value Contributors Award Ceremony. I would like to thank our Ministry of Industry and Technology, especially on behalf of myself and my nation, for bringing us together on the occasion of this meaningful program.
When it comes to those who add value to Kocaeli, one of the first places that comes to mind is undoubtedly the Informatics Valley. Even the expression Kocaeli seems small to me, it would probably be much more accurate to say those who add value to Turkey. When we opened the Informatics Valley 3 years ago, we stated that this would be the technology and innovation base that would shape the future of Turkey. In the short time that has passed, we see that our valley is taking firm steps towards this goal.
Informatics Valley is the cornerstone of large and powerful Turkey with its companies operating in sectors such as software, mobility, electronics, energy, design and gaming. Our valley has the identity of the largest technology development zone of our country with a closed area of 230 thousand square meters.
The Informatics Valley, which is connected by the technology corridor we have created between Istanbul-Kocaeli-Izmir, adds great momentum to our national technology move. I believe that our valley will further increase its technology and innovation capacity in the coming period. In such a place that reflects the horizon of the new Turkey, of course, rewarding our companies that add value to Kocaeli, one of Turkey's locomotive cities in industry, has a different meaning. Our ancestors say that ingenuity is subject to compliments, and labor without compliments is wasted. It is also the heritage of our tradition to appreciate those who do good work, exemplary employees, and those who come out with their works. Because every success awarded will be the herald of more qualified, larger, more beneficial works for the homeland, nation and humanity.
As the President of Turkey, I attach great importance to supporting innovative, high-quality and groundbreaking projects in their field. Today, we reward our companies that contribute to the development of Kocaeli and the growth of our city in different areas, especially in investment, employment and exports. I especially congratulate our companies that have exported the most, increased their employment the most and had the highest female employment since 2021. I congratulate our companies and entrepreneurs who have added value to the Turkish economy together with Kocaeli and are entitled to receive awards, and wish their success to continue increasingly.
As we have done so far, we will continue to support you, our business people, who dream for Turkey and try to make these dreams come true, in every field in the future.
Dear Friends,
Without gaining your technological independence and building your national industry, you can establish your freedom neither economically nor politically. Just as foreign dependency in defense creates serious problems, foreign dependency in technology and production creates similar risks. What happened during the coronavirus epidemic has revealed this fact in a striking way. We have experienced days when even the richest and most prosperous countries in the world could not find masks for health workers and citizens, and had difficulty in providing minimum health services. Due to disruptions in global supply chains, production in many places has come to a standstill for months. We all remember very well the images reflected from hospitals, markets and industrial sites. As Turkey, we have successfully tested the economy as well as health in this painful process.
Despite the irrational and irrational rhetoric of some that would lead the country to disaster, we did not allow economic life to stop. We encouraged our companies to continue production, trade and employment. Thanks to these incentives of our government, Turkish companies have constantly raised the bar of success at home and abroad.
We are one of the few countries that continues its economic growth steadily. With the 11 percent growth we achieved last year, we ranked first among the G-20 countries. In the first quarter of this year, we recorded a growth of 7.3 percent. While employment in the world is decreasing, we have reached the highest figure in our history based on the 31 million limit.
We break records in exports every month; Our exports in July increased by 13.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year and reached 18 billion 550 million dollars. Turkey, which was able to export only 36 billion dollars in 2022, I mean this by this: When we took office, our exports were 36 billion dollars, where have we come now? We leaned on $250 billion.
It seems that we will exceed our 2022 targets in tourism.
Turkey's name is increasingly mentioned in the search for an alternative address to the Asia-based production network. Thankfully, Turkish products and our companies fill the gap left by other countries in foreign markets.
As you know, I was in Sochi yesterday, and when I returned, I saw the cruiser ship from Russia docking at Trabzon Port on the television screens in the evening, and I was proud. Imagine, tourists now come to Trabzon Port with a cruiser ship.
The star of our country is shining with its industry, production capacity, qualified workforce, strategic location connecting three continents, health and transportation infrastructure.
At a time when the food and energy crisis is being talked about on a global scale, thank God, we are quite comfortable. With our balanced policy that prioritizes cooperation, peace and diplomacy, we have succeeded in protecting our country from the negative effects of the Russia-Ukraine war. By opening the grain corridor, we reaffirmed Turkey's key role in solving global problems.
We are closely monitoring the market imbalances caused by the sudden and excessive rise in commodity prices. We have taken and continue to take many steps to alleviate the burden on our citizens and business world due to exorbitant price increases and inflation.
We take care of all segments of our society in every step we take, from the minimum wage to the increases we make in the salaries of our civil servants and retirees, from the expansion of our social protection shield to credit opportunities for our business world.
We implement our Turkish economic model, which is based on the principle of growing our country with investment, employment, production, exports and current account surplus, without compromise. Hopefully, we will see the positive results of our policies more clearly in the first quarter of next year, especially in inflation. We will definitely take Turkey out of this global storm.
Dear Friends,
The way to stand out in the competitive structure of today's economy is high technology and innovation along with strong production capacity, we have taken many steps in the last 20 years to strengthen this aspect of the Turkish economy. We started the national technology move as the biggest industrial and technology breakthrough in the history of the Republic. While building an entrepreneurship ecosystem in our country that can compete with the world, we are launching programs that will support those who invest in Turkish startups. There is a sharp increase in the amount of investment in technology-based businesses in Turkey. We exceeded the investment figures we predicted for 2023 by a big margin compared to 2 years ago. While the investments made in technology companies in Turkey in 2020 were only 148 million dollars, do you know what happened in 2021? It exceeded $ 1,5 billion.
The $1.4 billion investment made in 132 technology startups in the first half of 2022 actually signals new records and new success stories.
In the first half of this year, Turkey became the country that received the most investment in Europe in the game software industry. While there were no companies that reached a valuation of 1 billion dollars in our country 2 years ago, the number of these companies has reached 6 today. In addition, we have designed, developed and produced our domestic and national helicopters, rockets and ammunition, training aircraft, armored vehicles, ships, torpedoes, air defense systems, most of them with our own means. Although some may ignore these achievements, I know that what has been done in the last 20 years is a great source of pride for our country. Our Minister just talked about rifles. Let alone the rifle, Mr. Varank, what a rifle, this country could not produce a pin, and now, thank God, we have come here. Today, when it comes to unmanned aerial vehicles in the world, the first thing that comes to mind is Turkish UCAVs. First it started with the UAV, then the UCAV, now AkÄ±ncÄ±.
When Mr. Bush was President in the United States, I was on a visit with him, I had not yet become Prime Minister, but I was the President of a party that won the election, and during my visit to the United States, Mr. Bush and I discussed an issue. I said, you know, you were going to give us the necessary support in the fight against terrorism, you were going to give us UAVs, you were going to give us UCAVs. He said, aren't they given? Said. I said yes, it's not given. And he immediately called Condoleezza Rice, they were going to give them to Turkey, why aren't they? They said, ""You will take care of this immediately,"" and they gave us the UAVs with 24-48 under the conditions of that time, but after that, of course, they pull it out.
May God have mercy on us, when Mr. Ãzdemir saw this state of us, he sat at the table with his children and took a step that day, and the first step was the production of the UAV, they carried out the production of the UAV, then the production of the UCAV took place and the last production of AkÄ±ncÄ± took place. Of course, with all this, Turkey has now become a country in this field, yes, there are people lining up, now everyone wants UAVs, UCAVs, AkÄ±ncÄ±. That's what it was all about, that's what we got to. Imagine a state of war, we talked about this with Mr. Putin yesterday, we talked about it again in Tehran, and now there are superpowers in the world that want to make joint investments with us in these areas. These things happen if you're strong, they don't happen unless you're not.
The whole world now accepts the ability of our UCAVs, which have proven themselves on the battlefields, to rewrite the doctrines of war. Turkey, which once imported even the most basic defense needs, today sells billions of dollars worth of products with advanced technology to many countries. Our 13 thousand engineers and technicians, trained in the best universities of our country, are working day and night with great love on the project of our national combat aircraft. Although some people try to discourage these young brothers and sisters who love their homeland and nation, we trust them, believe in them and support them in every field.
In the same way, we are implementing Turkey's automobile, one of our country's vision projects, step by step in accordance with the calendar we have determined. Hopefully, on October 29, 2022, we will hold the official opening of TOGG's Gemlik Factory and the ceremony of the first mass production vehicle coming off the line. In the first quarter of 2023, we will start to see TOGG on the roads of our homeland. Despite those who say you can't do it, you can't produce it, you can't sell it even if you produce it, we will offer Turkey's automobile to the service of our nation and the world. Just as we have brought our country to the level shown in the defense industry, I hope we will definitely achieve a similar success in the electric car. We have just listened to our young people, at this point, as long as we have such educated and self-believing young people, we will produce them, and beyond producing them, we will now compete with the countries of the world in electric cars.
Despite all the facts, those who still try to see Turkey as a straw importer are ignorant people who are unaware of the production capacity of the Turkish economy. Instead of binding Turkey with false information and defaming their own country, I invite these people to Kocaeli, let them come to Kocaeli and visit the organized industrial zone, regions and science valley of this place, see and understand their ignorance here. Let them see the production, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit here in person. Let them come and witness what Turkey has achieved in the industry. Let them come and witness the vision represented by the Gebze Informatics Valley.
Kocaeli makes huge contributions to the Turkish economy every year with its 14 organized industrial zones, industrial zones, strategic production facilities and approximately 270 thousand citizens working in manufacturing. This city of ours leaves its mark on the automotive, chemical and metal industries with its enormous production volume. In 2021, approximately 40 percent of Turkey's vehicle production was carried out by our city of Kocaeli alone. It came to the fore as the second most successful city in Turkey's acceleration in exports. A total of 128 research and development centers and 15 design centers add strength to the competitive power of our city with their work. Research and development activities carried out in 5 technology development zones in Kocaeli lead value-added production. When we look at this table, we can see very clearly what Kocaeli, our entrepreneurs and industrialists from Kocaeli mean to Turkey.
I think that those who add value to Kocaeli deserve the awards that we will present shortly. I wish these successes to continue increasingly. I wholeheartedly congratulate our companies, employees and entrepreneurs who have been awarded in different categories. I believe that Kocaeli, the locomotive city of Turkish industry, will hopefully raise the bar of success in innovation and technology.
I pray that my Lord will make your path and fortune clear.
I greet you with love, respect and affection and entrust you to God; Stay healthy.

Dear Secretary General,
Honourable Ministers,
Dear Members of the Committee,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and respect. Welcome to Istanbul, the meeting point of civilizations and continents. We are together again after the meeting we held on March 29, which constituted an important milestone in the negotiation process. I am very pleased to welcome you, our esteemed friends, in Istanbul on another historic day.
We are proud to be instrumental in an initiative that will play a major role in the solution of the global food crisis that has been preoccupying the whole world for a long time. With the text agreed upon today, we will all contribute to preventing the danger of hunger that awaits billions of people all over the world, from Africa to the Middle East, from America to Asia.
Ensuring world supply security in agricultural and food products is important in many respects. With this step, possible additional price increases caused by the loss of yield caused by the heat wave and drought will be prevented. We also help control food inflation, which has also become a global problem.
Of course, we did not come to this point all at once, we carried out an intense and arduous process with the Ukrainian and Russian authorities and United Nations officials for the export of the grain waiting in Ukrainian warehouses through the Black Sea, and we were in constant contact with our Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in this process. We held extensive consultations to address the expectations and concerns of both countries regarding this sensitive process. My ministers of foreign affairs and national defense have made great efforts. The contributions of the United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Guterres and his team to the plan they prepared the first draft of are commendable. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky for their leadership.
With the ship traffic that will start in the coming days, we will open a new breathing pipe from the Black Sea to many countries of the world. An agreement was established on all processes from the departure of the ships to their safe transfer and arrival at the port of destination. The execution and supervision of this extremely important plan will be carried out by the Joint Coordination Center to be established in Istanbul. Undoubtedly, the support of the international community is also of great importance in the successful implementation of the plan.
Dear Friends,
About 4 months ago, we made progress in the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia hosted in Istanbul and raised hopes that the war would end, unfortunately, the developments that took place after that meeting fueled the conflicts. From the beginning, we have been stating that there will be no winners in this war, and that not only the parties but the whole world will suffer. The conflicts that have been going on for about 5 months and its global effects unfortunately confirm this prediction. The longer the guns fall silent, the greater the human casualties as well as the economic costs. The war negatively affects not only the parties, not only the countries of the region, but also all humanity, including those in the most remote corners of the world. However, we also believe that this course is not destined. We want these conflicts, which cost the lives of innocents, to end as soon as possible.
We all know that there will be no losers in a just peace. I sincerely hope that this joint step we are taking today with the Russian and Ukrainian sides in Istanbul will be a new turning point that will revive hopes for peace.
Whatever the course of developments on the ground, the war will ultimately end at the negotiating table. It is in the interest of all humanity that this friendly and peaceful atmosphere we have established is attributed to steps towards ending the war. We will continue to act with the awareness of the responsibility imposed on us by our understanding of civilization. We will continue to fulfill the requirements of our neighborly law until peace prevails in our region. I pray that God will help us.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank all of you, all of you, again for your efforts. I hope that the agreement to be signed today will be beneficial for our countries and all humanity.
I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of myself and my nation, who have contributed to the process to this day, and I greet you once again with respect.

I greet you with my heartfelt feelings on behalf of myself, my nation and my country.
I would like to thank the President of the United States, Mr. Biden, for organizing and inviting this meaningful event.
Climate change and environmental problems are common issues of humanity. Therefore, the answers to be given in the face of these should be the product of global solidarity. In an equation where we experience the devastating effects of climate change every day, no one can remain indifferent to these problems. As Turkey, we see the fight against climate change and environmental problems as one of our top priorities. With this understanding, we ratified the Paris Agreement and announced our net zero emission target for 2053 and our green development revolution. At the 26th Conference of the Parties, we made significant commitments to reverse forest loss and land degradation through steel production, zero-emission vehicles, road transport, and the same determination.
We held the Climate Council with the participation of all national and international stakeholders in order to strengthen Turkey's policy and sectoral strategies to combat climate change for the future of our common home, the world. We are updating our nationally determined contribution. We will announce our long-term climate strategy and action plan, which will constitute our roadmap, at the end of this year. In line with the European Green Deal, we have adopted our Green Action Plan. We are increasing the number of our green ports. We are expanding our forests and protected areas. We are one of the world's leading countries in the fight against desertification and erosion. We also fulfill our duties in terms of reducing transportation-related emissions and fertilizer management. By the end of this year, we will take Turkey's first electric car, TOGG, off the production line and put it into service. We are promoting sustainable and climate-friendly modes of transport.
With the Zero Waste Movement, which is supported by my wife Emine ErdoÄan, who is appreciated by the United Nations and many global organizations, we have made great strides in environmental protection, recycling and emission reduction. With the awareness of the importance of technology and groundbreaking research and development, we carry out our green growth technology roadmap studies. We also resolutely continue our green hydrogen efforts. Financing and technology transfer stand out as the key topics of this process. Of course, the greatest responsibility in this regard falls on the countries that have had a share in bringing the problem to this point for centuries.
Another tool in the fight against climate change is renewable energy. Turkey is the 12th in the world and the 5th in Europe in terms of renewable installed capacity. We rank first in Europe in terms of geothermal installed capacity and second in Europe in terms of installed capacity of hydroelectric power plants. With the improvements we have made in the field of energy, an additional 100 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided annually.
The war in Ukraine has once again revealed the importance of energy security. Energy efficiency, transition to clean energy and energy transformation are integral parts of energy security. As Turkey, we have been taking a position with this understanding for a long time. In this way, we have made 54 percent of our installed electrical power consisting of renewable energy plants. 97 percent of the new power plants with a capacity of 3.5 gigawatts we established in 2021 are renewable energy plants. We are ready to cooperate and stand in solidarity with all our partners in the process of transforming to clean energy and combating climate change.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I hope that the Forum will be instrumental in good deeds, and I greet you once again with respect.

I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. Welcome to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation, this veteran place.
I am very pleased to be together with you on the occasion of March 31, World No Tobacco Day. Seeing you, our young people, who are the pride of our country with their achievements, at the forefront of our fight against tobacco products increases our confidence in our future.
I hope that the World No Tobacco Day on May 31, declared by the World Health Organization, will raise awareness against this deadly danger in all segments of our society, from our children to the elderly. As it is known, our world has faced the coronavirus epidemic and its grave consequences in recent years. However, the tobacco epidemic is the biggest global health threat as it ranks first among the preventable causes of disease and death. Despite the fact that seven million people in the world and 100 thousand people in our country die every year from diseases related to tobacco use, unfortunately, we are not yet where we want to be in the fight against this epidemic.
We have been at the forefront of this struggle since our youth. Starting from our own immediate environment, we warn everyone we encounter against the harms of tobacco products, and even confiscate cigarette packs, if any. We have continued our government's health and youth policies in line with the fight against the use of products harmful to the human body such as tobacco, alcohol and drugs. No one can deny that we have carried out the most effective fight against the use of tobacco products in our country, from the ban on smoking indoors to the imposition of high taxes. Research also shows that there has been a relative decline in smoking in our country.
Although, there are those who want to get around this struggle by turning to products such as hookahs, cigars and electronic cigarettes instead of known cigarette brands. But we are aware of all of them. We continue our struggle to include all tobacco products, and even more so to all kinds of substances that cause addiction.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank you, who have achieved success as a role model for our youth, for your support to this struggle.
Now, I would like to give the floor to Ms. TuÄba, who received the World Health Organization 2021 World No Tobacco Day European Region Award, and then to you.

Mr. President, Dear Brother,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Youth,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I am very fortunate to be with you on the Independence Day of Azerbaijan. As a son of a nation that knows very well how independence was gained and how valuable it is, I wholeheartedly congratulate you on your Independence Day. I commemorate with mercy and reverence our heroes, who crowned our glorious struggles for independence and future with their testimony. May Allah bless the souls of our saintly martyrs and make their places a paradise. May Allah not separate us from the blessed and blessed path of our martyrs.
Two weeks ago, we inaugurated Rize-Artvin Airport with my dear brother Mr. Aliyev. Today, we are holding another historical meeting together in Baku, this beautiful capital with a hard ash and a chivalrous people. In the person of my dear brother Ilham Aliyev, I would like to express my gratitude to the distinguished people of Azerbaijan for their sincere hospitality.
In Baku, the pearl of the Caspian, we are organizing TEKNOFEST, the world's most popular aviation, space and technology festival, with the slogan of one nation, two states, one festival. On behalf of my luck and my nation, I would like to thank our teacher Aziz Sancar for sharing our excitement on this proud day. I send my greetings and love from Bad-i Cuba, that is, from beautiful Baku, the city of the winds, to every inch of the land where the Caucasian Islamic Army under the command of Nuri Pasha fought together with our Azerbaijani brothers, to the plains where the ghazal of Natavan was heard, to the lands where our martyr brother Hudayar sang folk songs, to Ganja, Shusha, Fizuli, Lachin, and to every region of Azerbaijan. May our Lord perpetuate our eternal and eternal brotherhood, which is embodied here once again today.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations. Inspired by our common history, we further strengthen the friendship and affection between us and further strengthen our unity and solidarity. Although our diplomatic relations were established 30 years ago, our unity of destiny goes back to the depths of history. In 1915 in Dardanelles, in 1918 in Ganja, Baku and other regions of Azerbaijan, our hearts and wrists were together again in our common struggle. I would like to express the strength of the conversation between us with the beautiful lines of the late Bakhtiyar Vahapzade as follows:
Two sons of one mother.
Two arms of one purpose.
He is also great, and this is also great.
Azerbaijan, Turkey.
Our religion is one, our language is one.
Our month is one, our year is one.
Our love is one, our path is one.
Azerbaijan, Turkey.
Yes, we are two states, two peoples, who are one in both angels and joys, who are brothers not in words but in essence. Like our crescents waving gracefully in the sky, we are members of a noble nation that shares the same faith. Just like Anatolia, this is our land. Just like Turkey, this is our homeland. Just like the places where we were born, this is our homeland. In the same way, every inch of Turkey is your homeland.
Who can eradicate the love of Azerbaijan in the hearts of the Turkish nation? Who can put distance between siblings? What boundary can separate two brothers? Who can draw a line between our hearts?
As your hands bloom in your homeland,
Snow is coming to our province, my guard.
Who drew this border in my heart?
It feels narrow, it feels narrow, my guard.
Yes, we are here together today, breaking the boundaries drawn in our hearts. Wherever I have a guard from the West to the East, it is our home, our homeland, an inseparable part of our heartland. With this understanding, as Turkey and Azerbaijan, we first raised our relations to strategic partnership and last year to strategic alliance with the Shusha Declaration.
We have established strong collaborations in a wide range of fields ranging from energy to culture, from defense to commercial, economic and human relations. Here, SelÃ§uk broke a record for my brother, his brother, and the Bayraktar Family, especially this is a UCAV that is at the peak of AkÄ±ncÄ±, and by flying nonstop from Istanbul to here. Of course, I hope there will be many different developments, we will experience them, we will see them in. With the unique contributions of my brother Inspiration, we have taken our bilateral relations to a level that will set an example not only for the region but also for the whole world. I believe that future generations, who are the guarantee of our future, will further the exemplary cooperation between our countries in every field. It is also significant that my visit is taking place in the year of Shusha, the ancient city of Azerbaijan. I expect you to protect the glorious legacy of our saintly martyrs at the cost of your life when necessary.
Dear Youth,
I came here today with a large delegation as a sign of the affection between us. I bring to each of you the greetings of our young people whose hearts beat with you. I brought you the greetings of 85 million people whose hearts are stormed when they say Azerbaijan and Karabakh. I bring you the greetings of your brothers and sisters in Turkey, who pray for the peace and well-being of Azerbaijan every time they open their hands to the sky. I bring you the greetings of millions of your friends and brothers, who rejoice with Azerbaijani folk songs and grieve with Azerbaijani lamentations. I have brought to you the meaning and meaning of marching into the future with triumphant enthusiasm and enthusiasm, together with this vibrant community, which is a special expression of our solidarity with Azerbaijan, which has risen as a monument of stability in its region. Despite all the injustices and lawlessness it faces, we are proud of Azerbaijan, which has written an epic in diplomacy, economy and culture.
We are glad to see that under the skillful leadership of my brother Ilham Aliyev, dear Azerbaijan is confidently marching towards a bright future. This year marks the 130th anniversary of his birth. I would like to address you with the following words of the national poet of Azerbaijan, Ahmad Javad, whom I commemorate with mercy during his annual patrol:
My son of a Turk, I have a deep mind and intelligence,
What a wild oil to travel in my dew.
As much as there is a judgeship, there is a conviction, there is a ban.
I am rebellious against oppression, and even if I am oppressed, I will not be silent.
Yes, we have not been and will not be among those who remain silent in the face of injustice. On this occasion, yes, I also remember our Father Haydar with mercy, may his place be paradise. We have never been, and will never be, one of those who are pressured, threatened, or intimidated. We have not and will not stop saying the right thing and defending our legitimate cause in every environment against occupation and injustice. Just as we have no eyes on anyone's land or sovereignty, we do not and will not have a single inch of land to give to those with evil intentions.
Because we are not people brought together by coincidences, but the children of a great nation with its history, culture and civilization values. Wherever there is oppression, lawlessness and injustice, we are members of a brave nation that raises its voice and opposes it with all its cells. The Karabakh Victory is the latest example of our nation's heroic epics.
Thanks to the resolute stance of my dear brother Muzaffer Ali, the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Aliyev, Karabakh was freed from captivity after 30 years. The valiant members of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces have achieved a rare victory in Karabakh. This is very sensitive: The 44-day homeland war has shown the world what can be done when intelligence, technology and courage come together. In this process, the whole world has witnessed the success of our defense industry products, which we shared with Azerbaijan. Where we have come in defense industry products is important, but there is still a long way to go.
As in every other matter, we rely on the knowledge, energy, determination and effort of our young people in the defense industry. TEKNOFEST is an event that is a symbol of this trust. Today, we share with you the excitement and justified pride of organizing TEKNOFEST abroad for the first time in Azerbaijan.
This is an important platform for the Azerbaijani youth to showcase and develop their skills and talents. You, our young people, who are ranked in TEKNOFEST competitions with their work, will be the scientists who produce and develop tomorrow's unmanned aerial vehicles, artificial intelligence and digital technologies. Together with Azerbaijan, we will continue to open new horizons for our youth in many more projects and to realize our national technology move together.
The presence of our invited guests from the Organization of Turkic States in TEKNOFEST Azerbaijan increases my luck even more. I sincerely believe that the Turkic world will make groundbreaking breakthroughs with the young generations who will produce the latest technologies. The TEKNOFEST generation has signed extremely good projects in Turkey so far. I have no doubt that we will achieve the same success in Azerbaijan. I believe that the Organization of Turkic States will reach a more effective position in our common future with new and greater collaborations that will be laid on such platforms.
Mr. President, Dear Brother,
Dear Youth;
As we stated in the Shusha Declaration approved by our assemblies, our efforts to carry out joint research and production activities in the field of defense industry continue with determination. As in every field, we will be in close cooperation with Azerbaijan in the field of space and aviation.
Within the scope of the Organization of Turkic States, space agencies and relevant ministers of our sister countries come together. It is time to write a story of success, peace and development in these lands. By learning from the past and the pains we have experienced in the past, we need to build the future together as the peoples of the region.
We stand with Azerbaijan in peace as well as in war. As Turkey, we strongly support the lasting peace that my dear brother Aliyev wants to establish with Armenia for the sake of regional peace and stability. I personally witness the achievements of Azerbaijan in the way of development in all spheres. In Karabakh and Eastern Zangezur, the conditions for a great return are constantly being created through the reconstruction and revival process in which Turkey is also involved. As our ancestors said, we reap what we sow.
We are now sowing the seeds of development, development, prosperity and peace in these lands that have been mined for years. Last year, I opened Fuzuli International Airport, Karabakh's gateway to the world, together with my brother Ä°lham. Now there are airport projects in Zangilan and Lachin. The Aghdam Industrial Park and the Araz Valley Economic Zone will also allow the exploitation of the potential of the liberated territories. We are working together on projects related to smart cities and their establishment in these regions in the coming period, and we will continue to do so.
As my dear brother has stated, it is time to turn a new page in our region. Our goal is to establish lasting peace, to establish trust and good neighborly relations, to strengthen stability in our region by accelerating development. We will continue our close solidarity, contact and coordination with Azerbaijan for the realization of these goals. I pray that Mevla will make our path and our fortune clear.
With these thoughts, I would like to thank all our institutions that contributed to the realization of this beautiful festival. I pray to my Lord that TEKNOFEST Azerbaijan will once again be beneficial to our sister countries. I would like to express my gratitude to the Azerbaijani authorities, as well as the Ministry of Industry and Technology, the T3 Foundation Management, our participating young people and everyone who contributed to this beautiful festival. I greet you all with respect and love.
Stay healthy.

Dear Guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I appreciate the work of our Public Officials Ethics Committee, which is one of the important institutions we brought to our country in 2004, in order to establish an ethical culture in the public sector. I would like to especially thank all our members who have served on our Board since its establishment. Our Chairman of the Board, Ms. Zerrin, has already made quite comprehensive assessments about the concept of ethics and its place in public activities. I see the cooperation protocols made by our ethics committee with institutions as very important in terms of the prevalence and effectiveness of the studies. The fact that public officials work under ethics committees will have consequences that will ripple through all segments of society from top to bottom.
As it is known, it is possible to meet the concept of ethics, which is a word of French origin, with expressions of custom or morality. Morality, in its simplest form, means choosing the good between the good and the bad, having decency and manners. Our Lord has shaped the nature of the human being He has created by giving his soul and piety to his soul, essentially inclined to good morals. It is our common responsibility to ensure that these measures are protected in the public sector as well as in all areas of life. As the President, I have always supported and continue to support the increasing efforts of our Ethics Committee in this direction.
Dear Guests,
Turkey is one of the countries with the most deep-rooted state tradition in the world. Turkey, which has carried out the most ambitious change of administration in its history in recent years, has also shown that it has the will to carry this quality into the future. The responsibility of realizing the slogan of our ancestors, ""Let the people live so that the state can live"", belongs to public officials in the first place. For a long time in the past, our country has had to deal with tutelage, coups, structural problems poisoned by a climate of instability and terror. Like all segments of society, there may have been weaknesses in the public sector, which we can sometimes call ideological bigotry, sometimes moral erosion, and sometimes callousness. But because the leaven of this nation is strong and the tradition of this state is strong, we have overcome all of them over time. After all these difficult tests, we have now entered a critical period in which we can direct all our attention to the goal of a great and powerful Turkey.
In the past 20 years, our country has made significant progress in terms of the quality and prevalence of public services, as in every field. We have implemented many reforms, from improving the physical infrastructure of our institutions to facilitating legislation in favor of service recipients, from electronic government applications to increasing reconciliation routes. Of course, it was not easy to compensate for centuries-old omissions and shortcomings in such a short time. Democracy and
When you take all of them into account, it would not be wrong to say that Turkey has written a success story that will be proudly told for generations to come.Â  Thanks to the strong infrastructure we have brought to our country in every field from education to health, from transportation to social supports, from agriculture to industry, and the new management systems we have established, we have had the opportunity to turn to much bigger visions.
The stronger our nation's trust in its government, the better our chances of realizing this vision will be. Our Ethics Committee will take its place in the vision of a great and strong Turkey with its contribution to the conduct of the relationship between the nation and the state within the framework of morality, justice, equity and respect.
Dear Guests,
Being a public servant in the management system of our country has been carried out for a long time depending on certain rules, exams and processes. Each public servant works to fulfill the duty assigned to him within the framework of the constitution and laws. Apart from this, those who fall under the guidance of terrorist organizations or turn to illegitimate ways are also liquidated by law. There have been many personnel who have been dismissed from the public sector due to their affiliation with various terrorist organizations from FETÃ to the PKK. In the same way, the necessary procedures are carried out for each public employee who is determined to have resorted to illegal means within their own procedure.
However, we have recently started to see that the head of the main opposition party insults public officials, targets bureaucrats, and even openly threatens them. Of course, everyone, including public officials, can be criticized for their work. In the past, we have criticized many public officials, from governors to judges, from undersecretaries to inspectors, for their work and transactions that we think are not in accordance with the law and fairness. Yes, we criticized the work and transactions carried out, and we resorted to legal remedies when necessary, but we also complied with the work and process that emerged by saying that the finger cut off by the Sharia does not hurt, because this is what should happen in a democratic and legal state. In other words, we exercised our democratic right by criticizing, and we showed our respect for the law by complying with the work and process.
The method used by the leader of the main opposition is definitely not a democratic method in accordance with the rule of law. Because this person did not vote for him, he sometimes acts against workers, sometimes farmers, sometimes shopkeepers, and sometimes he openly targets public officials. Let's give in to his political ambition and understand this attitude. So, what does it mean to threaten the judge for his decision, the police for his action, the military for the operation he carried out, and the general manager for his signature? What does it mean to knock on the doors of public institutions as if raiding in a way that is contrary to the customs of the state? Can there be such a procedure in a democracy? Can there be such a style in the rule of law? Can there be such a method in the practices of the state? Never.
In this platform where we talk about the ethical issue of public officials, it is also our duty to defend the rights, laws and dignity of public officials. From here, I openly declare that anyone who speaks to our public officials outside the boundaries of the democratic and rule of law is an enemy of this state and this nation. Because the purpose of this ugliness is to render the state inoperable, thus depriving the nation of the services it deserves. We can never allow such disgrace, such brazenness, such immorality. Moreover, it is unreasonable to carry out such a process by targeting the family of a President.
The only place that our public officials will look at while carrying out their duties is the constitution and laws. With the cries of those who recite ghazals from outside, this state does not do business, and the civil servants of this state do not take positions. The guarantee of every public official who does his job is the law itself. We stand by every public official we see as our colleagues, from the civil servant to the Head of Administrative Affairs of the Presidency. May all our public officials be prosperous, Turkey does not have a single moment to lose with such dark operations.
Turkey needs moral, principled and productive politics that serves its own people, not threatens its own people. There is no doubt that those who speak and act in the opposite direction will be held accountable in their own medium.
Together with our public officials, we will work harder and make more efforts to bring works to our country, to serve our nation, to protect Turkey's interests and to increase its achievements. We will not allow anyone, no incompetent person, to come between us and this blessed goal. I pray that God will help us.
With these feelings, I once again congratulate our public officials on Ethics Week. I hope that the cooperation protocol to be signed between our Board and the Ministry of National Education will be beneficial for all parties.
Once again, I greet you with love and respect, with good health.

Their Speech After the Cabinet Meeting,2022-05-23,
Public Addresses in Adana,2022-05-21,"

Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. In your person, I wholeheartedly greet our young people in all 81 provinces. Mashallah, today Adana is another beautiful city both outside the stadium and inside it. Today, Adana is another exciting, another enthusiastic. I see today that you don't fit in your container. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your loyalty to the covenant and your love that knows no boundaries and distances. I would like to express my gratitude to all my brothers and sisters and the people of Adana who have embraced us with longing since the moment we set foot in Adana.
We love Adana, the city of agriculture, fertility and the sun that warms our hearts. We love the bravery and courage of this city. We love the patriotic people of this ancient city, who are always at the forefront when it comes to the nation and the nation and the country. You know, inspired by that beautiful Adana folk song, we say; ""My brother is from Adana, my dear is from Adana, I am burned for you, polite Adanali."" Did it happen?
May God perpetuate this conversation of ours that does not fit in stadiums. May Allah bless our companionship and solidarity forever. Â In the last 20 years, we have not allowed anyone to come between us and Adana or our other cities. Like others, we have never been one of those who knock on the doors of citizens from election to election, and we have never been one of those who have problems for the sake of their situation. Since our Prime Ministership, we have shared not only your troubles and troubles, but also your joy and happiness. We visited our cities at every opportunity, we made friends with all our citizens, especially our young people, we longed for them, we renewed our covenant and our people. Regardless of the result of the ballot box, we served our cities with the love of the first day without any discrimination.
In order to make Adana the shining star of the entire Mediterranean together with its region, we have equipped all four corners of our city with works and huge investments. Remember, if we don't get tired, the one who runs in love doesn't. Today, we act with the same feeling and sensitivity. We are in love with this nation, and because we are in love, we continue on this path by piercing the mountains. Like Ferhat, Ferhat was in love with Åirin, what did he do? He pierced the mountains and stopped at nothing to reach Smurf.
While some people want to use our youth as tools for their vicious fights, we are giving messages of brotherhood together with the young people of our 81 provinces. While some people speak in the language of hatred and anger, we speak to all of Turkey in the language of love of HacÄ±bektaÅ, Yunus Emre, Pir Sultan and Ahmed-i Hani. Come, we say, let's be one, let us love, let us be loved.
We will not allow the miscreants, who rely on the imperialists and their representatives, to spend the youth of this country like coins for the sake of their three-day iqbal. We will certainly not allow discord to be sown among our young people and to waste our young people like saplings. We will not harm our eternal and eternal brothers and sisters, and we will never leave the square to those who try to separate us. We will not leave this blessed homeland, where a martyr lies in every inch of its soil, at the mercy of blood merchants who seek to benefit from strife and chaos.
Dear Youth,
In our politics, there is no provocation, no provocation, no putting young people on the streets. In our understanding of politics, there is no antagonizing the nation or polarizing the nation. We are members of a political tradition that emphasizes love, tolerance, brotherhood and embrace, not inciting hatred, anger and hostility.
We have come here today not only to embrace you, but also to send a clear message to the political brokers who are eager to divide our nation with stale scenarios that have run out of shelf life. We have come to shout once again that no one can put a mortgage on Turkey's future. We have come to declare to everyone, friend and foe, that the steel will of our nation cannot be chained. Right now, when I see this excitement of my sisters and sisters, when I see this enthusiasm of our young people, I say, are we ready for 2023? Are we ready? Are we coming with a thump? Thanks.
We have come to engrave the fact that the dreams of our young people cannot be curtailed on the foreheads of some bankrupt politicians. I would like to call out to those who play politics with soufflÃ©s blown into their ears from outside, we did not find this country on the streets. We will not leave the square to the muslims who want to reignite street terror. We did not establish this country with the benevolence of someone, and we will not surrender it to the dirty ambitions of those who subcontract to the imperialists. When necessary, we will shield our chests against tanks and weapons that spew death, as we did on the night of July 15, but we will never tarnish our independence and future.
We will embrace, protect and protect each of our young people, each of our children, who are the guarantee of our bright future. As we have done for the last 20 years, in the critical period leading to 2023, all 85 million will be known to our brothers and sisters, and we will walk shoulder to shoulder to their future. No matter where others turn, we have no other compass than our nation and the deep wisdom of our nation. We do not have a single child to be sacrificed to the politics of fighting, nor to be seduced by the calculations of global powers.
This paradise country, where the Adhan al-Muhammadi rises five times a day from its minarets, is our homeland, our homeland, our most valuable asset. Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Bosnians and Albanians, each and every member of 85 million is our own brother. Regardless of their origin, profession, sect or political preference, all the young people of this country are our children. This is the city of brotherhood, and I hope that today it will turn into a channel where these blessed messages spread all over the country in waves.
Are you ready? Loudly.
One nation... One flag...Â  One homeland... One state...
We will be one... We're going to be big... We will be alive... We will be brothers... Together, we will be Turkey... With the solidarity they have shown here, the young people of Turkey will give the answer they deserve to the circles whose hearts are calloused and whose eyes are filled with hatred and hatred.
As Turkey, we need to protect this climate of brotherhood in order to be a leader, pioneer and leader in every field. We need your affection in order to make our country a place that is the envy of the whole world in the 100th anniversary of our Republic. We need the embrace of our young people so that we can bring our nation together with its dreams and goals; Are we ready for this? Â Then again... We will be one... We're going to be big... We will be alive... We will be brothers... We will always be alive against those who try to divide us...
I believe that this magnificent feast, organized under the leadership of our AK Party Youth Branches, will leave its mark on Turkish politics and hopefully herald a new era. I would like to congratulate those who contributed to this meeting, which increased our excitement, strengthened our will, and strengthened our love of serving the nation and the country.
I would like to thank each and every one of you for glorifying your brotherhood and instilling hope in us. I pray that Allah will make our path and our fortune clear. I pray that our Lord will perpetuate our unity, our solidarity, this love that gives confidence to friends and fears to enemies. And I pray, O Lord, eternal praise be to you for appointing this servant of yours to this nation.
Thank you, be present, stay healthy.

Their Speech at the Groundbreaking Ceremony of the Hospice Social Service City,2022-05-20,"

Dear Members of the Hospice Family,
Dear Guests;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I commemorate with mercy and gratitude everyone who has contributed to the DarÃ¼laceze since Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani, who gifted this distinguished institution to our nation so that the orphans can be a nobody. This institution, which embraces all the weak, that is, all the poor, without any discrimination, including belief, origin, race, gender and age, is one of the best examples of our civilization and our nation's view of people. With the inspiration we received from our ancestors, we have carried out and continue to carry out our work in every task we undertake with the understanding of let the people live so that the state can live, and with the principle that we love the created because of the creator.
The fact that DarÃ¼laceze has been a home of compassion for 30 thousand children and 100 thousand people in its 127-year history inspires us in our similar work. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the survival and development of this institution, which is a big family with their hearts, employees and haste, from our ministers to all the staff next to them.
Today, we are in the beer to lay the foundation of the social service city project, which I believe will take the services of our hospice to a new level. I will not pass without touching on a situation here. These jobs are our business. When I was the Mayor, we laid the foundation of a Hospice in KayÄ±ÅdaÄÄ± and opened it. As you know, the current government continues the process in the same way with the steps we will lay the foundation for today.
Of course, I have to ask something; Is there any step taken by the person or persons who are currently the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul? Either do something. In other words, you cannot say that we have served by opening a tap that does not have running water; Do not deceive the nation. Come and do such works, reach out to the people in distress of this country, do such things, and we will applaud you; But there isn't.
Look, our project, which will now be built with the understanding of horizontal architecture, will serve our people with nearly a thousand residents consisting of donors, healthy and bedridden residents, and children under protection. With all its units, from the rehabilitation unit to the places of worship including mosques, churches and synagogues, this project will be a work worthy of the purpose and history of DarÃ¼laceze. Of course, DarÃ¼laceze is a place that carries out its activities with the donations of the main philanthropists, as well as the share of real estate revenues and entertainment tax, and in this period, we took a step to make DarÃ¼laceze a much stronger character and place by contributing from the national budget. In the construction of our social service city, we expect the greatest support from donors as well as the state. Hopefully, we will complete this beautiful project in a short time and put it into the service of our nation.
I pray to my Lord to accept all the donations made to our Hospice in His presence and to convey them to goodness, reward and forgiveness.
Dear Friends,
Behind the success of our nation in facing the many attacks, troubles and chaos it has experienced for centuries with fortitude is the power of this unity, solidarity and solidarity trait. We need to firmly protect this trait, which is embodied by the accumulation of civilization and culture, family structure, social institutions and individual initiatives. It is the same reason why economically strong, developed countries have the most socially fragile and threatened populations. There is no example of this in any other country other than us, only we have it.
Rules are important, financial means are important, caring for individuals is important, but they only save the day. Without a strong social structure with the family at the center, none of this will be enough to save the future. Our priority is to keep our disabled groups, the elderly, orphaned children, and our strange gureba alive in our social structure by embracing our civilization heritage, faith and cultural values. Despite this, it is to provide our citizens who are orphaned and in need of help or support with the opportunities to lead a humane life through the institutions we have established and the mechanisms we have created. I hope that DarÃ¼laceze Social Service City, I say with conviction, will be the only example of this work in the world as soon as it is finished.
Thankfully, today Turkey is one of the countries with the best functioning and most inclusive social support system in the world, there is nothing like it. If I know this world, if I know it, there is no other example like our country in the world. When we came to the government, we brought the social assistance budget, which was 2 billion liras per year, to the limit of 100 billion liras; 2 billion-100 billion. The ratio of this figure to our national income increased from 0.38 percent to 1.36 percent. We have converted the aid, which used to be mostly in kind, into cash in order to protect the dignity of our people and to leave the priorities of their needs to themselves, thus reducing the proportion of the population whose daily expenditure level is below the world standard of 5.5 dollars from 34 percent to 10 percent.
We have established a separate ministry to strengthen our infrastructure and carry out social support in the most effective way.
Based on the fact that the population is the greatest power of a country, we attach particular importance to the work that will protect and support mothers and children. We make positive discrimination in every field from employment, health and education to this framework.
With the understanding that children under the protection of the state are entrusted to us by God and the nation, we have moved to a model that will raise them with their own families or in conditions close to the family climate.
We have taken an approach that includes our disabled people in life in every field with home care, rehabilitation centers, special care, houses of hope, employment.
We have implemented programs that aim to support our elderly with a 65-year-old salary, day care services, home care services, families and nursing homes.
We have provided our women with the most advanced rights in the history of the Republic in every field, from violence to employment, from motherhood services to political surrender, from freedom of dress to education mobilization.
We have embraced the relatives of martyrs and veterans with the greatest support in our history.
As you can see, we offer the opportunities of the state to all segments of our nation, especially to our people who need support.
Dear Friends,
From here, I would like to underline once again that the main thing is that all segments of society, from women to children, from the elderly to the disabled, are embraced and kept alive within the social structure within their families. Placing one's mother, father, disabled family member, or child in need of protection in a public or private institution when they have their own home, opportunity and time is diametrically opposed to our family culture. It is thought-provoking that a significant number of our elderly people staying in nursing homes have well-educated, well-career, high-income children. It is also regrettable that there are fewer and fewer large families where grandparents, parents and grandchildren live in the same environment even if they do not live in the same house. Unfortunately, this disintegration and erosion of the family structure has led to an uncertainty in the future of our values, which have been passed down from generation to generation.
Education begins in the family, and I go further, in the womb, and from an education that starts from there and develops at birth. The school cannot do this alone, it builds on the foundation laid in the family. When the values that should be given in the family are lacking, schools have difficulty in raising children with the national, spiritual, moral and human civility qualities we desire. For this reason, we have placed the strengthening of the family, the development of the content of education in a way that compensates for the deficiencies here, and the ownership of our culture at the top of our priorities in the coming period. Dear brothers and sisters, I hope we will not fall into the same mistake that developed countries and the West have fallen into.
For the sake of a Western-style understanding of security and prosperity, we will not break our ties with our roots, sacrificing our entire social structure, civilization and cultural values, and our faith, starting with the family. On the contrary, we will walk on the bridge we have built from the past to the past and take our place among the most advanced countries in the world in terms of democracy and development. We expand our visions with methods that will achieve our goals without compromising our civilizational heritage. This perspective, the foundation of which we are going to lay the foundation for today, is an application of this expansion.
For this reason, we confront our nation with the 100th anniversary of the establishment of our Republic. With our 2023 goals referring to the anniversary, we aim to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul. With our vision of 2053 referring to the anniversary, I hope we will hold our conquest festivals at AtatÃ¼rk Airport this year, and we will hold a conquest festival worthy of Istanbul at AtatÃ¼rk Airport together. Let me ask you, are you ready? Let's make a magnificent Conquest Festival in such a way that we hope to be worthy of the heavenly place Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han. We have dreams for 2071, referring to the thousandth anniversary of Manzikert, and we will walk accordingly on these dreams.
In short, we set out on this path with the most important symbols of our history, and I hope we will continue to implement our projects that will protect our weakness together in other areas with this understanding.
With these feelings, I wish that DarÃ¼laceze Social Service City, where we have come together to lay the foundation once again, will be beneficial to our country, our city and our residents.
As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the hadith ""hayr-un-nÃ¢s men janfau-n-nas"", we will reveal the greatness of the person who touches the good of people.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank everyone who supported and contributed to this project. Â Hopefully, we will open this exemplary project together. Now let me call our contractor company to me. How long will it take you to finish this place?
AUTHORIZED- 36 months.
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: What does that say? How are you the grandson of the Conqueror?
ONE AUTHORITY- It takes up to 30 months.
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: What are you doing? Mr. Hamza, it started from 36 months and went down to 30 months, what does this say? Let's change this contractor. Have you heard or known Suleiman the Magnificent? How long did it take to finish Sulaymaniyah? How long did it take for Architect Hamza Bey to finish SÃ¼leymaniye? Has it dropped to less than a year?
Now you're going to be working 24 hours a day, and you definitely have to finish this place next year. If necessary, you will change the shift systems. No one will be disturbed here, don't worry, you will work full time day and night.
THE AUTHOR: Chairman.
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: Witness, the word says, it is a lot of work. Hopefully, the promise we made will be fulfilled.
I greet you once again with love and respect.

Dear Members of the Turkish Armed Forces,
Heroic Soldiers of our Army, Navy and Air Forces,
Dear Guests,
I greet you all with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your efforts to ensure the security of our homeland, seas and skies, and to ensure that our citizens live in peace.
As a nation with the deepest state and military tradition in the world, we have an Armed Forces that are always ready to defend the homeland and protect the rights, interests and interests of the country in times of danger and campaign. The presence of our heroic soldiers, who are on duty day and night with the understanding of martyr if I die and veteran if I stay, is the greatest guarantee of our present peace and future.
On the one hand, our heroic army successfully performs many important tasks on our borders and beyond, on the other hand, it continues its exercises as planned, for which it has reviewed its preparations. The Blue Homeland 2022 exercise has been going on since April 11 in order to complete the operational readiness trainings and to test the effectiveness of our domestic and national weapon systems. Our exercise, which was carried out by the elements of our Naval Forces Command in the Black Sea, Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean in coordination with other force commands and public institutions, was thankfully successful. The ships, planes, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and special mission personnel participating in the exercise have shown that they are always ready for the operation by fulfilling their duties.
As a country surrounded by seas on three sides, Turkey's strong naval force is not a choice but a necessity. For this reason, we attach special importance to the continuous development of our Navy, both in terms of vehicles and personnel, and to keep them ready to make the highest level of contribution to the defense of the homeland. With the new ships and submarines we have built, and the weapon systems we have developed for our ships, we will continue these efforts with determination until we become the army with the strongest naval force in the region and in the world. In addition to defending the homeland with all its elements, our army is also a military force that carries out the world's most comprehensive humanitarian aid operations in many places.
While countries that consider themselves developed, modern and modern leave refugees to die at sea, and even try to kill them by sinking their boats, we, our Navy and Coast Guard have saved hundreds of thousands of lives from being lost in dark waters.
We have won the admiration of the world with the humanitarian rescue and aid operations we have carried out in crisis regions from Ukraine to Libya, from Africa to Central Asia.
Our heroic soldiers are still carrying out a comprehensive operation against terrorist elements in northern Iraq. On this occasion, I wish God's mercy on all our martyrs, especially our soldiers who were martyred in Operation Claw Lock. May Allah protect and spare all our heroes who are on duty for the survival of this country, every inch of which has been kneaded with the blood of martyrs.
I heartily congratulate the members of our Navy, Land, Air, Gendarmerie and Coast Guard commands and other institutions who successfully carried out the Blue Homeland 2022 Exercise.
To our sailors, I say that your bow is clear, your seas are calm, and your fortune is clear.
Stay healthy.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I wholeheartedly congratulate your Ramadan, the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness, and the end of which is salvation from eternal torment. As in every Ramadan, we wanted to have our first iftar this year with the relatives of the martyrs. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for honoring our table and being with us at the first iftar.
It is a beautiful word; Muhammad was the result of the conversation, what was the result of the conversation without Muhammad. Now, this is a table of love, and the crown jewel of this table of love is our Beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to express my gratitude to all our martyrs' relatives and veterans, our heroic soldiers, policemen, gendarmes, security protectors, and every citizen who is ready to shield their chests against the weapons of the enemy and traitors when necessary. I pray to my Lord that this blessed month will be auspicious for our country, our nation, our region and all humanity.
As you are well aware, since 2020, we have spent the months of Ramadan in the shadow of the coronavirus epidemic, in a bittersweet way. Thankfully, we have now largely eliminated the scourge of the epidemic. Hopefully, we aim to stay away from this issue for a few months and completely remove it from our agenda. However, this year's Ramadan was celebrated in an environment of war that took place in the north of the Black Sea and whose political and social effects reached us. We are working hard to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, with both of which we have close humanitarian, political, economic and historical relations. We especially wish that this war, the negative repercussions of which we also feel, will end as soon as possible, as it disrupts the balance of global trade in many areas from energy to food.
A similar humanitarian tragedy that we saw in Syria is now taking place in Ukraine. This picture has once again shown us how important it is to protect our homeland, to protect our freedom and to preserve our dignity. It should not be forgotten that those who do not have a homeland have no freedom, those who do not have freedom have no honor, and those who do not have honor will suffer all kinds of misfortunes. As a nation with the world's deepest state tradition, patriotism, and the strongest national unity and solidarity, we have never and will never put ourselves in this situation. Turkey is a country that has been exposed to all the scenarios exhibited in its south and north, especially in the last 10 years. Thanks to my Lord, we have broken all the games played on us with our nation one by one, and we have not harmed our independence and future. Hopefully, we will not bring it in the future.
We have not and will not give an opportunity to those who want to drown the country in blood and fire by messing up our streets. We trampled on the national will with coups and left the whims of those who wanted to put the chain of bondage around our necks. We are also in a struggle with all our strength against those who set their eyes on our economy. Hopefully, we will successfully conclude this struggle and put our country among the 10 largest economies in the world. We have this self-confidence thanks to the strength and support we receive from our nation and the sacrifices of our martyrs and veterans. Of course, we have challenges, but don't forget that we also have opportunities. Of course, we have questions, but the future that awaits us is full of answers. Of course, we have problems, but remember that our hope is greater. First of all, we must know the value of what we have. Thankfully, all our citizens on the homeland continue their lives in peace, confident in the safety of their lives and property.
While the world is in the throes of the threat of unemployment that comes with economic shocks, we are moving step by step towards our goals with our employment, production and exports. As we struggle with the cost of living, we give priority to ensuring that every person has a job to work. Hopefully, after 2023, Turkey will have entered a completely different era.
We believe that the best way to repay our debt of gratitude to our martyrs and veterans, especially to bring our country to its 2023 goals and to bequeath the vision of 2053 to our youth.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
You, as the families of the martyrs and the relatives of the martyrs, should believe in something very much. He is also estauzubillah bismillah, wala takÃ»lÃ» limen yuktelu fÃ® sabÃ®lillÃ¢hi emwÃ¢t, bel ahyÃ¢un walÃ¢kin lÃ¢ tes'urÃ»n. Ila ahiril ayeh. Do not call those who are killed in the way of Allah dead. They are alive, but you don't know it.
May God help us. May Allah bless all the relatives of the martyrs with his paradise, Jamal, and our martyrs who are neighbors of his beloved habib.
With these feelings, I wish your Ramadan Sharif to be blessed again. I pray that the fasts we will keep and the prayers we will perform during this month will be accepted and accepted in the sight of God. I commemorate with mercy our saintly martyrs who fell to the ground as if entering a rose garden, and I express my gratitude to our veterans on behalf of my country and nation. I would like to thank you for your presence in our iftar. Be entrusted to God.
May God help us.

Dear Friends,
Dear Members of the Committee,
Welcome to Turkey and our Istanbul. We are pleased to host you at such a critical time and to contribute to your efforts to establish peace. I hope that your meetings and meetings will be beneficial for your countries, our region and all humanity.
The negotiation process, which you carried out in accordance with the instructions of your leaders, raised hopes for peace and excited the whole world. In this context, we wholeheartedly support the negotiations. You have made great efforts on behalf of your countries, and you continue to do so. Therefore, I congratulate you on behalf of myself and my nation.
The conflict, now in its fifth week, deeply saddens us as your friends and neighbors. From the first day of the crisis, we have made sincere efforts at all levels in order to prevent escalation, and we have tried to fulfill the requirements of this law, especially the neighborliness, friendship and human closeness between us. Personally, I have carried out intensive diplomacy with many of my counterparts, especially your esteemed heads of state. My Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of National Defense, and Chief Advisor Mr. Ibrahim were also in constant contact with their counterparts. We have taken a fair approach that protects, protects and observes the rights, laws and sensitivities of both sides in all international platforms where we have a say. As a country that has witnessed a lot of suffering in its region, we have worked and strived to prevent a similar picture from emerging in the north of the Black Sea.
As Turkey, we have never shied away from assuming responsibility for peace and stability in our region and beyond. We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. The prolongation of the conflict is not in anyone's interest. Every person who dies, every building that collapses, every resource that is thrown into the air and buried in the ground when it should be spent on the way to prosperity is a value that is detached from our common future. It is up to the parties to stop this tragedy. It will be in everyone's interest to establish a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible. We think that we have now entered a period in which concrete results should be obtained from the negotiations.
As of this stage, you, as the members of the delegation, have assumed a historical responsibility. The whole world is waiting for good news from you. Under the guidance of your leaders, you are laying the foundation for peace. We are ready for any contribution that will make your job easier.
Today, I am leaving for Tashkent after this speech to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan, but I am leaving my Foreign Minister in Istanbul to give you the necessary support if you need it.
It is possible to reach a solution that will address the legitimate concerns of both countries and be accepted as credible by the international community. I believe that you will not hesitate to take the initiative for the restoration of peace. As you know, we do not have a mediation role in the negotiations, but we will continue to provide facilitating opportunities as long as you request, as long as you need.
Of course, we are aware that you have discussed difficult and thorny issues in the negotiations. However, it is certain that the proposals on the table and the consensus to be reached will form the basis of the final peace to be achieved in the future. I am confident that with a sense of responsibility, dedication and a constructive understanding, you can reach a permanent, equitable and sustainable solution. Your progress in the negotiations will also make possible the next stage, which is contact at the level of leaders. We are ready to host such a meeting. Â Even your coming together here is a reason for hope in the world and in your countries. I hope that your efforts on the road to peace will turn into beneficial results.
I ask you to convey my heartfelt greetings to your heads of state, each of whom is a dear friend of mine.
I wish you all success in your negotiations. Thank you.

Mr. President,
Dear Ministers,
Dear Guests,
Dear Fellow Citizens,
Dear Brothers and Sisters of Workers,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection, may God's peace, mercy and blessings be upon us all. At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to convey to each of you the greetings and love of your brothers and sisters in Turkey.
Welcome to the Turkish House in Dakar. I am very pleased to be with you on the occasion of this visit to Senegal after a 2-year hiatus. Among the African countries, Senegal is in a truly exceptional position for us. Our Embassy in Dakar is one of the first embassies we opened in Africa in the 1960s. The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) also opened its first office in West Africa in Dakar in 2007. Senegal and Dakar were the first addresses of our reunion and re-embrace with Africa. Today, we are taking these strong historical, cultural and human ties one step further.
I wish that the new chancellery building of our Embassy in Dakar, which we have opened, will be beneficial to our country, our nation and the people of Senegal. With its location, physical conditions, architecture and outbuildings, we are fortunate to bring a work worthy of the Republic of Turkey. As you know, during my visit in 2016, we signed a protocol regarding this place, and within the framework of the protocol, the Senegalese Government allocated us a land of 10 thousand square meters in this precious area of the city. On September 11, 2020, during the visit of my Minister of Foreign Affairs to Senegal, we laid the foundation of our building and carried out the works rapidly. The construction of kanÃ§Ä±larya, service buildings on an area of 1910 square meters and lodgings on an area of 1546 square meters was carried out by Turkish companies as Summa and TosyalÄ±.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank Summa and TosyalÄ± Holding, who have implemented many projects in Africa, for their contribution to the construction of our Embassy. I would especially like to thank all my brothers and sisters, from architects, engineers to workers, who carried out the construction of this beautiful building in record time with their efforts and sweat.
I would like to especially thank my brother, Mr. President Sall, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is now with us. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the Senegalese authorities for their support to this process. Our relations with Senegal, which is a key country in its region, are at an excellent level. Hopefully, we will reach one billion dollars with the common political will to strengthen our bilateral relations. Our cooperation continues strongly.
I am pleased that Turkish companies are supporting Senegal's infrastructure and development, especially in the construction sector. Especially after the opening ceremony of our embassy buildings, we will also attend the opening ceremony of the Senegal Stadium with a capacity of 50 thousand people, which was built by Turkish entrepreneurs, together with my dear brother Sall and the heads of state of other invited countries.
Dear Guests,
I see our embassy building as a structure that properly represents Turkish culture and our deep-rooted state tradition in terms of its location and architecture. Our Embassy in Dakar has become one of our exemplary embassy buildings in the world with its new buildings. And here our citizens got an Embassy building that they would be proud of. It will continue to provide the best service for you and make significant contributions to the presence and promotion of our country in Senegal.
The doors of our embassy are open to our citizens, as well as to our Senegalese brothers and sisters and to everyone living in Senegal. We expect you, our brothers and sisters living in Senegal, to act knowing that you are citizens of a state that is great with its history, great with its values, and great with its conscience. And as the Maarif Foundation, our children are here, our children are here, thanks to the Maarif Foundation, they are currently serving the education of nearly 800 students. And I would like to thank all our teachers working here on behalf of myself and my nation. And I believe that these beautiful puppies will take important roles in the Senegal of the future.
With these thoughts, I wish that the new buildings of our Embassy will be beneficial to our country, our nation and Senegal. I would like to express my gratitude to you, our guests, who participated in this proud day of our country.
He wishes success to our ambassador and his colleagues. And here, again, on behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank both Summa and TosyalÄ± Holding for their efforts here and for bringing such a work for our country, and I greet you with love and respect.

Dear Members of the Board of Directors of MUSIAT,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with my heartfelt affection. I pray to God that our meeting and the consultations we will hold will be beneficial.
First of all, I would like to thank all my brothers and sisters who have supported a development operation and movement in their country since 1990, who have made efforts in this regard, and who have especially contributed to the strengthening of our democracy. I wish God's mercy and forgiveness to our brothers and sisters who have apostatized to eternity from MUSIAD members.
Since its establishment, MUSIAD has been an important roof where our businessmen, who dream for their country and nation and believe in the ideal of a great and strong Turkey, come to beer. Even during the periods when the shadow of tutelage descended on our country like a nightmare, especially on February 28, MUSIAD has always maintained its upright stance, dignity, and attitude in favor of the nation and national will. In the last 20 years, we have always felt the support of MUSIAD in the difficult struggle we have been waging for the future of our country and nation. From the Republic rallies to the Gezi protests, from the December 17-25 attempt to the July 15 coup attempt, we repelled all the attacks against the will of our nation, together, in solidarity.
Behind all our achievements, from rights and freedoms to records in the economy, there is the determination of our government as well as the efforts of our organizations such as MUSIAD. Despite all the operations Turkey has been subjected to in recent years, it is taking firm steps towards its destiny in unity and solidarity. In addition to the difficulties of the coronavirus epidemic, we see that it has been instrumental in opening new windows of opportunity in front of our country. Both our growth figures for last year and our record export figures for 2021 have clearly demonstrated this fact. In addition to records in areas such as growth and exports, our employment increased by 2.7 million compared to the pre-pandemic period, which is a huge achievement.
At a time when the whole world is making its economic maneuvers to prevent the employment crisis, we are pursuing bigger goals, so these 4 important topics are constantly on our agenda. What is that? Investment, employment, export, production. Of course, the place where we bring all these and impose them is again two important infrastructures, which is stability and trust, so we need to continue on our way without losing them.
Our priority with the Turkish economic model is to grow our country through the current account surplus under these 4 headings, thus making our country one of the main production centers of the world. For this purpose, we offer and will provide all kinds of support to all segments of our society, especially our business world.
As you know, with the package of measures we announced on December 20, we took the foam on the exchange rate. Then, we took steps to protect the living standards of our people in every field from minimum wage to civil servants and pensions. With the stabilization of the exchange rate, we also think that there will be no more excessive fluctuations in the markets due to unbalanced foreign exchange demand. Just like the exchange rate, we want to take the foam on inflation in a short time and bring our country to the coast in this regard.
In this process, our expectation from you is to work, produce, export and increase your investments without giving a premium to the doomsayers whose only capital in politics is to instill despair in the nation. When you achieve this, God willing, no one will prevent Turkey's rise and no one will be able to prevent us from achieving our goals.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank you again on behalf of myself and my delegation for your visit. I pray that Allah will make our path and our fortune clear

Mr. Prime Minister, Dear Friend,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with the best of greetings, respect and affection, Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi and blessings. I would like to praise Almighty Allah who brought us together today and brought our hearts together on such a beautiful occasion. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your patience, affection and loyalty to the covenant.
I know you came from Skopje, I know you came from ShkodÃ«r, you waited here for hours. And today we are having a full day in Albania in all respects. I have brothers and sisters from Kosovo, and I send them my heartfelt greetings and love. We share the joy of putting into service the works and projects that are the sign of the brotherhood between us.
This morning, we delivered the earthquake houses built by Turkey in LaÃ§. We were very pleased to see that the wounds of the earthquakes that occurred on September 21 and November 26, 2019 were healed. I wish God's mercy on those who died in that earthquake. I am really proud of the delivery of 522 houses today on behalf of my nation. At that time, we were in constant contact with my brother Prime Minister Edi Rama. These artifacts came into being.
I have just had the opportunity to address your representatives in the Albanian Parliament. Now, we are fortunate to reopen our Ethem Bey Mosque for worship after the restoration carried out by TIKA. Ethem Bey Mosque, which is the common historical and cultural heritage of Turkey and Albania, is also the jewel of Tirana. Thanks to God, our mosque, which was built by the son of Fatihan by embroidering stitch by stitch and pouring handiwork and light into every point and every particle of it, is regaining its former glory and architectural elegance today. This unique work, which offers us a fine understanding of art that is very common in the Balkans with its colorful hand-drawn decorations, is among the most distinguished structures that carry the methods of the Ottoman period to the present day in terms of its architecture. Our mosque, which adds a different beauty to Tirana during the day, will hopefully leave those who see it with its exterior lighting at night from now on.
As Turkey, we attach importance to supporting the development of Albania as well as reviving the works of our cultural heritage. In this context, we have implemented 546 projects since 1996 through TIKA, and I hope we will continue to stand by the Albanian people in the future. If there is no extraordinary situation, I hope we will finish the NamazgÃ¢h Mosque by Ramadan. I believe that there is no issue in the Balkans that cannot be overcome with close, sincere and effective cooperation between Turkey and Albania.
Together with my dear friend Prime Minister Edi Rama, I hope that it is a requirement of our brotherhood to implement such works as soon as possible.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I wish that our Ethem Bey Mosque will be beneficial to our brothers and sisters in Albania. I would like to express my gratitude to the Albanian authorities in the person of the Prime Minister for their support in the restoration process.
I pray that the prayers to be made in this beautiful mosque and the prayers to be performed will be accepted and accepted in the sight of God. I pray that Allah does not leave us without love, without water, without air, without a state, without a temple, without a minaret and without a call to prayer.
I offer my love and respect to all of you.

Dear Members of the Menderes Family,
Dear Sons of the Cadres Shouldering the Burden of the Democratic Party Cause,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I wish that the Adnan Menderes Museum, which we came together on the occasion of its opening, will be beneficial to our city, our country and our democracy. The Democratic Party and the Menderes period, which constitute the most glorious and saddest page in the history of democracy in our country, are adorned with examples that should be passed on from generation to generation. In this museum, materials about the childhood, youth, political life of the late Menderes, his experiences during the May 27 Coup and its aftermath have been brought to history in a tidy way.
This museum on the edge of the Ãine Stream was established in a place where the late Menderes was remembered with longing by integrating it with his freedom while he was a prisoner in YassÄ±ada. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank everyone, especially our Minister of Interior SÃ¼leyman Soylu and his family members, who contributed to our country's acquisition of such an important museum.
It is a fact that we faced many difficulties while building our new state after the establishment of the Republic. Some of these difficulties have been unjustly used as a pretext for institutionalizing hostility to the nation's values in the hands of one-party fascism. Especially in the post-Gazi Mustafa Kemal period, the CHP has become a party that wanders on the shores of fascism not only in terms of mentality but also in practice. The multi-party political life, which was passed in the flow of the new world order established after the Second World War, turned into a volcano where the nation's demands for democracy and development erupted, which the CHP cadres of the time did not expect. In this respect, the Democrat Party and the Menderes period are one of the most important milestones in Turkey's struggle for democracy and development. In the same way, May 27 is the first attack of the malignant disease that has plunged our country into the infamy of endless coups, juntas and tutelage.
Of course, what happened during the coup period caused irreparable wounds in the hearts of our nation at all stages from the first day to the day of execution. We know that the embarrassment of not being able to take care of Menderes enough breaks the hearts of many people. As a matter of fact, the late Arif Nihat Asya expressed this feeling with the following lines:
""I went back and around the country
I saw and watched everywhere
I covered the exposed
My veil didn't recognize me!
I said I'm with you again
I said I am the way I am
I thought I'd come out and say it
My lectern didn't recognize me!
What a word to get battered
Dig and dig
To death while being taken away
Death did not recognize me!
My Turk was good news to the country
I've traveled, tell me
One day I didn't say it
My Turk didn't recognize me.""
Yes, this rebellious silence has taken such a place in the hearts of our nation that on July 15, it resisted tanks, cannons, guns and bombs with unprecedented courage. Those who did not hesitate to drag the country into a catastrophe that resulted in the execution of Menderes for the sake of their own political ambitions yesterday are still pursuing the same insidious schemes. As I gave examples in our AK Party Provincial Advisory Council Meeting, whatever accusations they made against Menderes and his friends yesterday, today they are directing the same slanders against us with different expressions. We leave the charlatanism of those who have not had their share of democracy and who have not been able to produce works and services that will taste the excitement of development in their lives to the discretion of our nation.
Looking back, one wonders in what direction and at what pace Turkey's journey to democracy and development would have continued if the 1960 coup had not taken place. Then the 1971 memorandum and the years of turmoil that followed. Then the 1980 coup d'Ã©tat and the subsequent period of political instability. Afterwards, we think of the terrorist organizations that are unleashed on us under all kinds of covers, and we inevitably swallow.
Unfortunately, it is impossible not to feel sad after years of endless games by those who are determined to paralyze Turkey in politics, economy and security. With the help of God and the support of our nation, we have entered a period in which we have the power, opportunity, ability and determination to disrupt this vile game, thanks to the strong infrastructure we have brought to our country in the last 20 years. I truly believe that when we bring our country to its 2023 targets and make it one of the 10 largest economies in the world, the souls of the late Menderes and his friends will be at peace. When I see the chronological map of the services of the late Menderes below, it is impossible not to remember 20 years.
With these feelings, I wish the Adnan Menderes Museum, which we have opened once again, to be beneficial. And I hope that local and foreign tourists, especially our people who long for democracy and freedom, will visit the region on the edge of the Ãine Stream.

H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairman of the African Union Commission,
Dear Ministers and Heads of Delegations,
Dear Participants,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. Through you, I send my love and respect to my brothers and sisters all over Africa. I am very fortunate to host you in Turkey on the occasion of the 3rd Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit.
Welcome to our beautiful Istanbul, the cradle of civilizations, the city of history and culture. We are delighted to meet you again after the two summits we held in Istanbul in 2008 and Malabo in 2014. I would like to thank the African Union Commission for their contributions to the execution of our summit despite the pandemic conditions. As the President of Turkey, I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for traveling thousands of kilometers to represent the continent and attending our meeting. I hope that the meetings and consultations we will hold will be beneficial for our countries.
As the Turkish nation, we have strong human ties with African peoples dating back to the 9th century. Centuries-old mosques, libraries, inns and ports built in different cities of the continent are just some of the signs of the ancient friendship between us. Traces of our common history can be found in every corner of the continent, from Sudan to Libya, from Harar to Cape Town, from Mogadishu to Timbuktu.
We know that our War of Independence, which we carried out against the invaders of the period, gave courage and inspiration to the African peoples in their freedom struggles. Despite this common past, it is a fact that we have experienced an Interregnum in our relations for a period of time due to the conditions of both our country and the continent. However, during this period, Turkey never turned its back on Africa and its peoples. Despite the difficult conditions of the period, it strongly supported the freedom movements on the continent, especially in North African countries.
By declaring 2005 as the Year of Africa in our country, we opened a new page in our relations with the continent. On the one hand, we embraced our African brothers and sisters again, and on the other hand, we tried to advance our cooperation on the basis of equal partnership and win-win. We have always rejected supremacist, noble, orientalistic perspectives on the continent. In 2008, we consolidated our cooperation, which gained momentum with the African initiative, as a strategic partner of the African Union.
With the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summits that we organized twice, we clearly demonstrated the seriousness of our country and the importance we attach to relations with the continent. Praise be to God, as a result of our joint efforts, we have brought Turkey-Africa relations to levels that were unimaginable 16 years ago.
Look, I would like to share some figures with you in order to show our common success here. Our trade volume with the continent, which was 5.4 billion dollars, exceeded 25.3 billion dollars in 2020. Our trade in the first 11 months of this year has already reached 30 billion dollars. The value of our investments across the continent reached $6 billion. Turkish companies employ approximately 25 thousand African brothers and sisters. Our contracting companies have completed 1686 projects with a total value of up to 78 billion dollars across Africa. The investments of our brothers and sisters of African origin in our country are also increasing. Initiatives that started in the luggage trade and tradesmen are turning into companies that provide employment and contribute to the exports of our country. We also support and encourage these investments of the African diaspora in Turkey.
On the other hand, we are closely following the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement, which entered into force on January 1, 2021. I believe that we will increase our bilateral trade to $50 billion and then to $75 billion with our joint efforts. When we look at the distance we have covered in the last 16 years alone, it is clear that the real potential between us is even beyond these goals.
Dear Friends,
In addition to trade and investments, we have also improved our cooperation in other areas. The number of our embassies on the continent increased from 12 in 2005 to 42. Again, while there were only 10 embassies of African countries in Ankara in these years, this number has increased to 37 today. We have the largest diplomatic representation in the world in the face of hunger in Somalia. I visited Somalia with my wife in 2011, where the international community turned a blind eye to the plight of millions of people. I tried to draw the attention of the world community to the humanitarian crisis in this brotherly country. That visit changed not only the fate of Somalia, which was described by some as a failed state, but also the fate of East Africa. Together, we have shown the world that when the necessary support is provided and sincere efforts are made, a people can be reborn from the ashes.
We have shown our sensitive attitude towards the tragedies in Africa in other humanitarian crises affecting the continent, especially the Ebola epidemic. In addition to our diplomatic missions, we have further expanded our presence across the continent with our institutions such as TÄ°KA, Yunus Emre Institute, Maarif Foundation, Anadolu Agency, Turkish Airlines and the Red Crescent. In today's world, where old colonial habits are tried to be maintained with new models, we strive to win together, to develop together, to develop together, and to walk into the future arm in arm together. In this process, we attach special importance to reaching women, youth and children. The number of African students benefiting from our Turkey scholarships has exceeded 14 thousand. From time to time, we meet these brothers and sisters who are graduates of Turkey in the countries we visit and we are proud of their achievements.
Our flag carrier, Turkish Airlines, has become one of the international airlines connecting the continent to the world. With the overcoming of the problems caused by the coronavirus epidemic, I believe that the number of flights will increase in the coming period. Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan Training and Research Hospital in Somalia, Turkey Training and Research Hospital in Sudan, and Niger Turkey Friendship Hospital in Niger continue to be a gateway to healing for our African brothers and sisters.
During the coronavirus epidemic, which has claimed the lives of nearly 5.5 million people around the world, we have not left our African friends alone. In these difficult days, when developed countries were completely closed to themselves, we ranked second in the world in medical aid. We have contributed to a total of 160 states and 12 international organizations, including 44 African countries. We are aware of the global injustice in access to Covid-19 vaccines and the victimization of Africa. It is a disgrace to humanity that only 6 percent of the African population can be vaccinated against Covid-19. In order to contribute to the solution of this problem, we plan to share 15 million doses of vaccine in the coming period. We have recently applied for emergency use approval for our domestic and national vaccine TÃ¼rkovac. When the process is completed, we will offer our vaccine to the service of all humanity together with our nation and African brothers.
Dear Guests,
I made my first visit to the African continent in 2004, about a year after I assumed the post of Prime Minister. As Prime Minister and President, I have made 50 visits to 30 African countries so far. The vast majority of them were the first visits of our country at this level. Likewise, we had the pleasure of hosting friendly heads of state and government from all over the continent in our country.
Almost every year, I take special care to add a trip to Africa that covers several countries to my overseas visit program. Every time I go to the African continent, I feel as excited and happy as I did my first visit in 2004. Because during these visits, I saw people who worked tirelessly, sweated and embraced life with hope despite all kinds of difficulties. I saw loyal working women who carried the weight of the whole world on their heads. With the light of dawn, I saw African children with sparkling eyes as they set out on the road with their bare feet. For years, I have seen elderly, piri mortals, representing thousands of years of African wisdom in their gray hair. I have seen politicians and prudent statesmen who strive for the welfare of their country and nation day and night. I have seen young people who struggle with the belief that tomorrow will be much better than today, and who dream for their country.
I have seen artists, writers and poets who have conveyed the ancient accumulation, culture and richness of Mama Africa to the whole world with their works. I have seen compassionate hearts that do not hesitate to share their bread with their neighbors, even if they need it themselves. Just as I have seen poverty, famine, destruction, tears and pain, I have also seen hope, nobility, courage, compassion, altruism, brotherhood, cooperation and sharing. I have always been highly respected for the effort, struggle and perseverance of our African brothers and sisters.
Dear Friends,
Nelson Mandela, the Madiba of Africa, said that when one crosses a great hill, one will find that there are still many hills to overcome. In our journey to improve our relations, we have overcome many challenges from economy to trade, from health to investments. Although we have achieved the greatest successes in our history, we have never been satisfied with the position we are in. Drawing strength from our common history and the strong friendships between us, we have always struggled to reach better, more beautiful and higher.
Of course, we care about the level of our relations with both the African Union and the countries of the continent compared to 16 years ago. Just comparing the figures of 2005 with today's figures is proof of how great we have achieved in a short period of 16 years. However, we are pursuing much bigger goals and loftier goals. We no longer want to cross hills, we want to cross mountains like Kilimanjaro. We are fighting under the banner that the world is bigger than five, not only for ourselves, but also for our African brothers and sisters.
What we have experienced in the last few years has shown the mistake of leaving the fate of all humanity at the mercy of the 5 member states of the Security Council. It is a grave injustice that the African continent, where 1.3 billion people live, does not have the right to speak and decide in the Security Council. I believe that we need to join forces so that Africa can be properly represented in the Security Council. Although those who benefit from the current status quo are disturbed by our efforts, we are determined to fight for the future of our children.
The summit, which we held for the third time today, has revealed that Turkey's interest in the African continent and its issues is not temporary. Likewise, with these summits, we had the opportunity to observe the importance that our African brothers and sisters attach to cooperation with our country. Now we know each other better, we know our sincerity, and we see that there is a very serious potential for cooperation between our countries. From now on, our primary goal should be the institutionalization, deepening and diversification of our relations.
As Turkey, we wish to strengthen our cooperation with regional organizations in this context. We will accelerate our efforts to increase the number of diplomatic missions and representative offices of our country throughout the continent. We will continue our incentives to increase the number of representative offices of African countries in our country. We will commission different projects for a better understanding of African history, culture, literature, politics and economy in our country. We will strive to root our cooperation in a wide range of fields from health to defense, from energy to agriculture and technology. As a country that has been fighting separatist terrorism for nearly 40 years, we are well aware of the security challenges faced by our African brothers and sisters. Organizations such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab and Daesh are not only the problems of a few countries, they are the common enemy of all of us. In our eyes, there is no distinction between FETÃ and PKK and these terrorist organizations that threaten the lives of innocent Africans.
We are ready to offer Turkey's high-tech defense industry products and experience in the fight against terrorism to the benefit of our African friends. On this occasion, I would like to thank once again all our friends who supported us in the fight against FETÃ, banned the activities of these terrorists, transferred and closed the so-called educational institutions affiliated with the organization to our Maarif Foundation.
Dear Guests,
An African proverb says that everything we do today wins history. Hopefully, we will leave our mark on the future of Turkey-Africa relations with the works we will do and the decisions we will take today. As a matter of fact, intensive work was carried out in this direction before the summit, and our senior officials discussed the documents submitted to our approval today. Our Foreign Ministers also finalized the texts yesterday. I would like to thank them for their work and efforts. It is up to us to approve the declaration, action plan and joint implementation report documents and open the door to a new stage in our relations. I believe that by opening this door, we will step into a bright future. I pray that God will help us. As I conclude my words with these thoughts, the 2nd Congress, which will be held on 11-13 March 2022. I hope to meet you again at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.
With the belief that our summit will be successful, I offer my best wishes and wishes for the future of the Turkey-Africa partnership. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the organization of the summit and participated in our summit. Once again, I greet you with respect and affection.

Dear Izmir Residents,
Dear Guests,
Dear brothers and sisters; I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, affection and respect.
I would especially like to express my pleasure to be with you on the occasion of our visit to Izmir. At the beginning of my words, I wish that the earthquake houses we have delivered with the works we have opened will be beneficial to our city. I would like to congratulate all our institutions that have brought these investments to Izmir.
I am very pleased to come together with you, my disabled brothers and sisters, who have written success stories in sports, art, education and business life. I would especially like to thank each and every one of my brothers and sisters from all corners of our country who attended this meaningful meeting.
I would also like to express my gratitude to our AK Party Headquarters Social Policies Directorate, which brought our hearts together in this beautiful atmosphere and allowed us to make hasbihal. For 19 years, we have been continuing our work with determination and sincerity with the slogan that if the AK Party exists, there is no obstacle if we exist.
We have reinterpreted the concept of the charitable state, which is one of the distinguishing features of our civilization, by combining it with today's social state principles. We love the Creator, and we have brought the world's most comprehensive social security and health system to our country by acting with the belief of the Creator. We have made special efforts to ensure that no one, no citizen is left outside the umbrella of compassion of the state. While growing Turkey, increasing production, and encouraging employment, we have strived to embrace all 84 million people without any discrimination, we are striving and we will continue to do so.
We have tried to provide our disabled people with opportunities to exist in society as equal individuals in every field from education to employment. We have shaped our social policies for our disabled brothers and sisters with an understanding based on rights, not aid. We have overcome obstacles together with our disabled brothers and sisters with the policies we have implemented in areas such as education, rehabilitation, employment, social assistance, home care, entrepreneurship, sports and cultural activities, health and accessibility.
With the Law on Persons with Disabilities enacted in 2005, we have taken historic steps on many issues that concern our disabled people, from education services to care services, from employment to the prevention of discrimination. With the constitutional amendment made in 2010, we went further and enshrined in the constitution positive discrimination against people with disabilities. With another regulation made in 2013, we completely removed hurtful and humiliating phrases such as disabled, crippled and bruised.
The number of people receiving support within the scope of home care assistance, which we started in 2007, reached 535,700 as of 2021. We have put into service 128 barrier-free day life centers throughout Turkey, with at least one center in each province. While the number of public care and rehabilitation centers was 21 in 2002, this number was increased to 104 as of October 2021. Likewise, we have stood by our disabled citizens with the disabled coordination centers we have established in 81 provinces within our party. We have also taken many steps to increase the employment rates of our disabled citizens and to ensure that they can maintain their lives without being dependent on anyone.
In 2012, we broke new ground in the world and introduced a separate and central exam for the disabled. So far, we have made 62,337 disabled appointments, breaking record after record in this field. Currently, the proportion of people with disabilities among total public employees has approached 2 percent, and I hope that this number will increase even more in the coming period.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
You prove every day that overcoming obstacles is first and foremost a matter of faith. As a nation, we are proud of your achievements in sports, art, business, politics, education and other fields. We are working hard to ensure that our disabled brothers and sisters participate in all areas of life without any hindrance. By rebuilding our schools, cities and streets, we strive to remove the obstacles in front of our disabled brothers and sisters one by one.
On the other hand, it is not possible for our disabled citizens to take the place they deserve in society with the efforts of the state or the government alone. It is imperative that all individuals, families, civil society, our business world, our municipalities, our media, our schools and our universities support this process. The more awareness we can create on this issue, the more we can spread the sense of responsibility, the more we can reach our goals. To the extent that we break the prejudices about our disabled brothers and sisters, we can remove the obstacles in front of them. As the President of Turkey, I expect more sensitivity and solidarity from my nation regarding our disabled people. As we have done so far, we will continue to stand by our disabled brothers and sisters, to make their lives easier, to increase their peace and well-being.
I believe that our disabled brothers and sisters will continue to make us proud with their achievements in all areas of life.
With these thoughts, I hope that the Izmir Meeting We Overcome Obstacles Together will be beneficial.
I would like to thank our AK Party Headquarters Social Policies Directorate for leading this beautiful program.
On behalf of you, I congratulate all my disabled brothers and sisters for their efforts, beliefs, courage and success, and I pray for success from my Lord.

Dear Members of the Turkish Armed Forces,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I am very pleased to be with you on a day of historical importance for the Turkish defense industry.
I hope that the national naval cannon land firing tests will be successful. Â Naval cannons are weapon systems that come to the fore as an indispensable element of navies. These weapon systems, which are the striking power of warships, play a very critical role in the moment of communication. As Turkey, we added naval artillery to our efforts to localize our defense industry about a year ago. As in other areas, we aimed to eliminate our country's dependence on foreign countries in naval artillery. Especially in the recent period, there have been serious problems in both costs and delivery times for products coming from abroad. In addition, we were subject to many embargoes and obstruction attempts, both visible and invisible. This project is one of the best examples of public-private sector cooperation.
With the joint efforts of the General Directorate of Machinery, Chemical Industry and Shipyards, which we have restructured, and Ä°Ärek Makine, Anzatsan Engineering and Ermaksan Technology, Turkey has once again achieved what could not be achieved. At the end of the process, which was actively supported by our Ministry of Industry and Technology, we produced our national naval cannon in a record time of 12 months. Hopefully, the naval gun, which will soon be tested on land, is one of the most important weapon systems of our navy. With the national naval cannon it has developed, Turkey has now become one of the few countries that produce this weapon system.
The national naval cannon has an effective range of 16 kilometers. Our Navy has become even stronger thanks to this weapon, which can fire 80 shots per minute with 5 different firing modes.
Unlike the systems currently used, the national naval cannon is equipped with a digital fire control system developed with domestic and national resources. With the introduction of this weapon system into the inventory, the Turkish Navy will have a much stronger and more effective mobility.
In addition, the high cost and hidden embargoes encountered in procurement from abroad will now be a thing of the past. I would like to congratulate all our institutions, companies, engineers and designers who supported the realization of this important project.
I wish our national naval cannon to be beneficial to our country, our nation and the Turkish Armed Forces.
Once again, I salute you with respect and entrust you to Allah.

Organization of Islamic Cooperation 8. Speech at the Food Safety Conference,2021-10-27,"

Dear Ministers,
Dear Guests,
On behalf of myself and my nation, I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, assalamu alaikum, mercy and blessings. Thank you for your kind invitation, the 8th Session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. I wish the Conference of Ministers responsible for Food Security and Agricultural Development to be successful. I pray to Allah that the conference will be beneficial for the entire Islamic world and humanity. I would like to welcome all our guests from different corners of the Islamic geography to our Istanbul.
While the world population is increasing, the global demand for food is increasing day by day. The negative consequences of climate change such as natural disasters, water scarcity, forest fires, floods, erosion and drought also destroy our food resources. While production costs are increasing all over the world, access to food is becoming more difficult, especially for disadvantaged segments of society. Guaranteeing food security has become one of the main agenda items of humanity today. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the supply-demand balance in agriculture and led to breaks in supply chains. This situation has further deepened the food problem on a global scale. As a matter of fact, United Nations reports reveal that the number of people suffering from hunger in the world has increased compared to last year. According to the same reports, about 10 percent of the world's population is threatened with hunger. Similarly, there is an increase in the number of undernourished people, and the forecasts for the upcoming period paint a pessimistic picture.
We see that the pandemic has complicated problems not only in access to basic food, but also in other aspects that concern human life. On the one hand, 810 million people do not have access to the most basic foodstuffs, while on the other hand, large capital owners can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a few minutes of tourist space travel. In such an age where communication has become so widespread and the world has turned into a global village, no one has the luxury of saying ""I am not from anyone else"". Access to adequate, nutritious and reliable jowls is not a privilege, but a fundamental right for all. As members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, raising our voices for a fairer world is a requirement of our responsibility towards humanity. Of course, for this, it is of great importance that we first increase the solidarity and cooperation between us.
As Islamic countries, we need a developed agricultural sector not only economically but also strategically. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached the desired level in this regard. Although the member countries of the Organization have complementary economic structures in the field of agriculture and food, unfortunately, they cannot benefit from this potential sufficiently. We want all our brothers and sisters to benefit from the experience and opportunities of Turkey, which is the world leader in many agricultural products thanks to its large arable areas as well as suitable geographical and climatic conditions.
Organization of Islamic Cooperation 8. I believe that the Conference of Ministers Responsible for Food Security and Agricultural Development will open new horizons for our countries.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I wish the conference to be successful and thank all my brothers and sisters who contributed to the meeting. I greet you once again with respect and entrust you to God, with good health.

Distinguished Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to thank you for your kind invitation and especially convey my love and respect to all participants.
I would like to welcome the distinguished members of the business world who participated in the conference from abroad to our country. I hope that the conference will be beneficial for our countries and lead to new cooperation.
For nearly two years, we have been struggling with a global crisis that has an economic dimension as well as a health dimension. Last year's economic data clearly shows what a storm our world is drifting into. For example, while the world economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 2020, there was a contraction of nearly 10 percent in global trade. While international direct investments decreased by 42 percent, the total global debt reached 282 trillion dollars, the highest level in history. Food and commodity prices have broken the record of the last 10 years worldwide. Most of the countries have tried to overcome this crisis by retreating into their own shells instead of sharing the burden by opening up to the outside. In particular, the breaks in production and supply chains have led to the emergence of problems that will last for many years.
Dear Friends,
As Turkey, we have adopted a different method both in the fight against the epidemic and in the field of economy in this process. Even during the periods when the epidemic was felt most intensely, we did not close contacts in production, logistics, employment and industry. We have stood by them with the support and incentives we have provided to our business world, tradesmen, SMEs, farmers and tradesmen. Thus, despite the negative economic climate, disruptions in supply chains and increasing protectionism, we closed 2020 with growth.
In 2020, we were among the countries that recorded the highest growth in the G-20 with a rate of 1.8 percent and increased industrial production the most. We continued this momentum by achieving growth rates of 7.2 percent in the first quarter and 21.7 percent in the second quarter of 2021. Likewise, we broke a record in exports and left behind 212 billion dollars on an annual basis. While investments at the global level decreased by 35 percent during the epidemic period, thank God, it almost did not slow down in our country. Hopefully, we expect to complete 2021 with a growth of 9 percent.
In parallel with these achievements, we see that the interest of international investors in our country has increased. It is an important achievement that the name of our country comes to the fore more in the search for alternative destinations to the Asia-based production and supply network. As an administration that has carried out historic reforms in every field for the last 19 years, we are determined not to disappoint this trust in Turkey.
With the Istanbul Financial Center, we are seeking to become one of the most important centers in the world in this field. We want this project to be a center for Islamic finance. Hopefully, we will complete our legislative work on this soon.
In addition, our country has a very attractive legislation for international investors in terms of business establishment and business opportunities. Opportunities such as VAT exemption, tax reduction, customs duty exemption, and investment location allocation offer favorable conditions especially for strategic investments.
In addition to industrialization, our steps to improve the infrastructure environment and our moves to combine transportation corridors also open new windows of opportunity for investors. There are many areas where we can cooperate, from energy to transportation, from the defense industry to technology, from finance to food. We expect you, our esteemed guests and investors, to make the most of these opportunities. I want you to know that our relevant institutions are with you from the beginning to the end of your investment processes.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I hope that the Regional Finance Conference will be successful and beneficial for our business world. I offer you my love and respect, I entrust you to God, stay healthy.

Last May, we exchanged ideas with the executives of some American companies via video conference and discussed new cooperation and investment opportunities. This time, the Turkish-American Business Council gave us the opportunity to come together with you, the esteemed representatives of the American business world. I would like to thank the Council and hope that our meeting will contribute to the development of economic relations between Turkey and the United States.
Dear Participants,
Turkey and the United States are two strong strategic partners and allies for 70 years. Our cooperation, which is based on very special and solid foundations, has contributed to peace, stability and security in many geographies of the world for years. Recent critical developments have once again demonstrated the importance and value of the strategic partnership between our countries. We have serious cooperation opportunities not only in economy and trade, but also in a wide range of areas ranging from security to terrorism, from defense to investments.
As in personal relationships, states may also have differences of opinion on some issues from time to time. We believe that these problems can be overcome through dialogue in solidarity and mutual respect. When the issue is considered from this perspective, it will be seen that Turkish-American relations have the maturity and capacity to overcome the difficulties encountered. The important thing is that there is a strong political understanding and will in this direction in both countries.
In our frank and comprehensive meeting with my dear friend President Biden in Brussels on June 14, we reaffirmed our common will on this issue. We are in full agreement with Mr. President that the development of our economic relations is both possible and necessary. Together, we emphasized our determination to increase our bilateral trade volume to 100 billion dollars. We agree that this figure represents a realistic target that can be easily achieved if the right steps are taken. As a matter of fact, the bilateral trade volume between Turkey and the United States increased to 21 billion dollars last year despite the epidemic conditions. The United States ranks third among the countries to which Turkey exports the most. We expect our bilateral trade volume to reach $25 billion by the end of the year. I believe that if we evaluate the post-pandemic period correctly together with you, our business people, we will easily reach our target of 100 billion dollars.
Dear Guests,
Increasing mutual investments play an important role in the development of our economic and commercial relations. As of June 2021, the number of American companies operating in Turkey reached 1971. U.S. direct investments in Turkey amounted to $13 billion. Turkish investors also made $7.2 billion in direct investments in the United States. With its affordable cost and wide production facilities, well-educated workforce, and modern logistics infrastructure, Turkey is increasingly coming to the fore in global trade.
Our country has shown that it is a reliable link in global supply chains throughout the epidemic period. During the epidemic period, our country differed positively not only in health but also in production, logistics, public security, employment and social supports. In the search for alternatives to the Asia-based production network, Turkey has started to come to the fore more and more with its strategic location that unites three continents. Despite the unfavorable global economic climate, disruptions in supply and logistics chains, and increasing protectionism, we closed 2020 with growth. Last year, we ranked second in the G20 with a growth rate of 1.8 percent. In the same period, we became one of the countries with the highest increase in industrial production in the G20. We continued this momentum by achieving growth rates of 7.2 percent in the first quarter and 21.7 percent in the second quarter of 2021. Likewise, we broke a record in exports and left behind 210 billion dollars on an annual basis.
On the other hand, we are not departing from our reform agenda, which we have been pursuing uninterruptedly for the last 19 years. We recently shared our Human Rights Action Plan and Economic Reform Package with our nation. We continue our work that we started with the aim of bringing our country to a civilian, more democratic and libertarian constitution. We will continue to implement the necessary legal regulations for international investors to invest safely in our country.
We are also closely monitoring the radical changes in the global economy and production paradigm. We see that humanity is increasingly feeling the devastating effects of climate change. We are taking innovative and environmentally friendly steps to transform our economy in this direction.
Our flexible and high production capacity offers many opportunities for American companies, especially in terms of supply chains and security of supply. One way to strengthen our economic and commercial solidarity is to diversify our areas of cooperation. In this respect, the energy issue offers serious opportunities to both countries. Our cooperation with the United States in the field of energy, especially our joint activities in the liquefied natural gas LNG sector, continues to increase. I believe that we will further advance our cooperation in this field in the coming period.
Our flag carrier, Turkish Airlines, already operates direct flights to 10 destinations in the United States and will launch flights to Dallas Airport on September 23. It is obvious that this air bridge, which was established with the developed network of Turkish Airlines, will have positive reflections on all aspects of our relations, especially in tourism.
Dear Friends,
In fact, you are the ambassadors of friendship and partnership between the two countries. Your strong support will be a great contribution to the economic and commercial partnership between Turkey and the United States to reach its true potential. We need to increase mutual dialogue and cooperation in order to make more use of this lucrative potential in front of us. To this end, we develop locally-oriented trade policies for 50 states of America with different sectoral priorities. While we are sincerely working in this direction, some unilateral actions of the United States to prevent trade against Turkey make our job difficult. However, we believe that these issues will be resolved through dialogue on the basis of mutual interest and understanding. Of course, you, our esteemed business people, have a big role in this regard. We expect you to take initiatives before the American authorities to remove the barriers to our trade.
There is no doubt that your contributions and the contributions of the business councils will have a multiplier effect on the advancement of Turkish-American relations. I know that you see very well the real purpose and danger of the baseless smear campaigns against our country by some lobbies and interest groups whose only agenda is to poison Turkish-American relations. I believe that you will take a firm stance against these malicious activities that are far from legal and historical facts.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to express my gratitude to you once again for your presence in this important meeting.
I would like to remind you that the doors of our relevant institutions and organizations in Turkey and our representative offices in the United States are always open to you. I expect you to continue to trust in Turkey's bright future and potential.
I would like to thank those who contributed to the execution of our meeting and wish it to be beneficial.
I say stay healthy, bon appetit.

Mr. Speaker of the House,
Dear Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party,
Dear Youth,
Dear Members of our Archers Foundation,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. I pray to God that the 950th anniversary of the Manzikert Victory will be beneficial for our country and our nation.
We are in Ahlat once again to witness the epic of those who forged iron with iron and kneaded Anatolia with love. It is the 950th anniversary of the Great Victory that opened the doors of Anatolia to our nation. I commemorate with mercy, gratitude and gratitude all our martyrs, veterans and heroes who laid down their lives without blinking their eyes so that this land becomes our homeland and remains that way.
I commemorate with condolences all our elders who have served our nation at all levels, worked and made hearts, from Sultan Alparslan, the conqueror of Anatolia, the glorious commander of the Epic of Manzikert, to the present day.
Every city in the world has a different story, and the story of Ahlat is completely unique, because this city has always served as a bridge between Eastern and Western civilizations throughout history. This region, which is the gift of Hazrat Omar RadÄ±yallahu Anh to our civilization, has also been the gathering and dispersion center of the Muslim Turkish nomads heading westward from Central Asia. This ancient city, which has hosted many sultans, scholars, travelers, dervishes, merchants and craftsmen for centuries, is called the dome of Islam by the Seljuks and the Ottomans as the ancestral city.
With its works such as castles, cupolas, baths, lodges, workshops and cemeteries, Ahlat continues to witness history today. They call Ahlat the city where the stones speak. The Seljuk Square Cemetery, which bears the title of the largest of the historical Islamic cemeteries, is the memory records of our thousand-year existence in these lands today. The Ahlat Tombstones, which we can call the Orkhon Monuments of Anatolia, are almost like a title deed belonging to our nation today. Although we see this great heritage of our ancestors a lot and do not witness attempts to patch it up with other societies and civilizations. But praise be to God, thanks to our honorable historians and the healthy memory records of our nation, we know very well where this place is and what it means.
This city is also of great importance in winning the Battle of Manzikert. The destruction of the vanguard forces of the Byzantine Emperor who came to Ahlat by the Seljuk forces here was the first step of victory. In the following centuries, the men of the heart who came to Ahlat from the Khorasan region and from there spread all over Anatolia established a climate of love, tolerance and brotherhood in these lands.
When Ecdat came to these lands, he encountered a ruined, exhausted and ruined geography. In those years when Anatolia was reconstructed from all sides and adorned with our patterns, Ahlat became an important center of science and art. This city has raised many scientists, architects and craftsmen. Ahlat scholars, aristocrats and men of heart played a major role in putting the seal of Islam on Anatolia. With the belief that it is our duty to revive this treasure, which has been neglected for years, we have started extensive works both in the old cemeteries and in the city. With the event held here today, we both commemorate our ancestors and shout our will to protect these lands as our homeland forever to the whole world.
We have struggled with all our strength to bring our country to the level of democracy and development it deserves with the 2023 targets. With the visions of 2053 and 2071, we bequeath to you the task of placing Turkey among the most powerful countries in the world in all respects. 30-year and 50-year periods, which seem very long in people's lives, are very short periods in the history of nations and states. When we make the most of these short periods, we should not forget that we have lit a light in front of our nation and state that extends beyond the centuries. I have no doubt that our young people will achieve much greater success in the past 19 years, just as we have brought 5 times and 10 times more services to our country than in the history of the Republic. The perseverance and determination in the eyes of our young people is the greatest proof that none of the attacks against our unity, solidarity and brotherhood will succeed.
I cannot praise my Lord enough for blessing me with companions, companions and comrades of the heart like you.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
The programs we have carried out in Malazgirt and Ahlat have gained their current vitality thanks to our Archers Foundation and our young people from all over our country with them. I am pleased to see that these programs, which have reached their fifth year, are enriched with more enthusiasm, wider participation and more comprehensive events every year, except for the exception of the pandemic period.
Both our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, and the Ministry of Interior have made very important infrastructure investments in this place in order to carry out these programs in the best way possible, accompanied by our guests from abroad. This is the place you see, the rooms are the best expression of this.
Last year, we opened the Ahlat Youth Camp, and today we are opening the Ahlat National Garden. Again, on this occasion, we are opening the official bus station, which has been completed in our district. I wish these works to be beneficial to our city and country.
Our National Garden is built on an area of 167 thousand square meters. With its National CafÃ©, landscape areas, oba tents, show areas, tribune, horse and archery sports units and other service units, our National Garden has truly become a work worthy of Ahlat's glory. I would like to congratulate everyone who contributed to bringing this work, which I believe is one of the symbols of the bridge we have built from the past to the future, built by our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, to our country.
Of course, in order to see these works and the meaning behind them, you need an eye that sees, an ear that hears, a language that can express the truth, and most importantly, a heart full of love for country and nation. Praise be to God, we have always moved our country forward because we have been looking in the same direction with our nation for 19 years, sharing the same dreams, pursuing the same goals, and fighting the same struggles. In this way, neither the tricks of tutelage, nor the attacks of terrorist organizations, nor the attempts of the coup plotters, nor the traps of economic hitmen could prevent our march towards the construction of a great and strong Turkey on the solid infrastructure we have.
In the process of restructuring the global political and economic order, we see the importance of this power of our country much better. Thankfully, we have transformed from a country that was struggling for existence and non-existence within its own borders yesterday to a country that has a say in every critical issue in its region and in the world today. Hopefully, there is very little left for the future, which is the symbol of trust, stability, prosperity, justice, conscience and morality that we have built for ourselves and all our friends together with our young people. This is the reason behind the gradual change of form of the attacks against our country and the targeting of our youth in particular. As the People's Alliance, our young people, whom they wanted to pit against each other in the past by sometimes calling them right-leftists, sometimes by saying Alevi-Sunni, sometimes by saying progressive-reactionary, sometimes by saying Turkish-Kurdish, did not and will not come to the game this time, and as the People's Alliance, they will see us standing in front of them.
The latest PKK and FETÃ incidents show us that we should not leave the slightest gap in equipping our youth with national and spiritual values, equipping them with the technological capabilities required by the age, and paving the way for them in every field where they can improve themselves. By Allah's leave, we will no longer allow anyone, any group, or any power to inflict such pain and losses on our country, our nation and our youth.
We will work harder to put everything good, beautiful, true, right and justice that takes its inspiration from our own civilization at the disposal of our nation. Contrary to those who hope for the disaster of their own countries and nations, we are doing everything we can to provide each of our 84 million citizens with the services they deserve. You have seen what has been done in the Eastern Black Sea. On the other hand, you have seen BartÄ±n, Sinop, Kastamonu, what has been done here. In all these disasters, we took our steps immediately. You have seen the steps we have taken in Antalya, MuÄla, all these fire disasters. With the awareness that we do not have a single day, a single hour, a single moment to lose, we will continue on our way by carrying the flag of struggle higher and higher.
With these feelings, we celebrate the 950th anniversary of the Manzikert Victory, which we see as the symbol of opening the doors of Anatolia to Islam and our ancestors. Once again, I congratulate you on the anniversary.
I would like to thank everyone who provided us with this beautiful meeting with our young people in Ahlat and who is here with us.
On this occasion, I would like to commemorate our Professor Dr. Haluk Dursun, whom we sent off to Dar-Ã¼l Beka in a traffic accident two years ago. We are determined to carry the struggle of our teacher Haluk, who devoted his life to culture, history and the youth of our country, much further. May Allah bless him with his Paradise and Jamal, I salute you all with love and respect.
Stay healthy.

Dear Living,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings on such a meaningful day after a long time.
From here, I send my heartfelt greetings, love and respect to my brothers and sisters in each district and neighborhood of Hatay, the pearl of the Mediterranean, the city of history, culture and solidarity.
Brothers
As you can see today, we are taking steps to make Hatay much different with many openings, especially our Hatay City Stadium, as well as dams, as well as many sports facilities.
Of course, I greet you with this meaning, especially since I am in the atmosphere of tolerance in Hatay with its Turkmen, Kurds, Arabs, Muslims, Christians, as well as Jews.
Brothers
We have always said this: We will be one, we will be big, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey together. And this unity, this togetherness, this brotherhood has brought us to this day, there are better days ahead of us, but we will do it together with you. I believe in you, I trust you. And I say, are we ready for 2023? Are we preparing?Â  And will 2023 hopefully be a year of change and transformation in Hatay? Your cries already show this.
And by the way, I see it coming now, unfortunately there is not a nail in the nail, there is not a step taken, unfortunately, the main arteries are stuck where we left them. But we continue on our way, here is Hatay City Stadium with a capacity of 26,600 behind me. We speak with our works, and they only speak. Remember, the donkey dies and the saddle remains, the human dies and remains; We speak through our works. Look, now there is Hatay Indoor Sports Hall, now it is also finished, I hope we will finish it in a short time. We will do whatever is necessary and worthy of the youth of Hatay.
And my brothers and sisters, I am grateful to you for seeing my brothers and sisters from Hatay here with such great interest in this atmosphere once again today. I would like to thank both my sisters and gentlemen. Despite this heat, you are here, despite this heat, you welcomed us in this way. And as long as you are with us, you should know that Hatay will embrace much better days.
Let me ask you something, who built this airport? Brothers; Who built all these roads, three departures, three arrivals, two departures and two arrivals, from the airport to here, all the way to Iskenderun? And do they have a way that others are doing here? But that's our job, our strength.
The Amik Plain was under constant floods, did we save the Amik Plain from these floods, alhamdulillah? Now, hopefully, with the new dams and closed water distribution systems, we are coming to the point of completely solving the water problems, and we are taking steps towards it.
But remember, just as Hatay in this country knows very well the pain of occupation, the taste of freedom, and what homesickness means, we know very well what it means to serve Hatay, which knows this very well, and we have a lot to do for it.
Now I'm saying, if you'll excuse me, I'll be with these guys over there and continue the rest of my speech from there, okay. Have you allowed it? At the same time, of course, it is possible to watch it both on the giant screen on the back and from here, okay.
There's no stopping...
Thank you, be present.

Their Speech at the Vaccination Program Carried Out with Volunteers within the Scope of the Phase-3 Study of the Domestic Vaccine,2021-06-22,"

Dear Scientists,
Dear Brothers and Sisters;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I wish that this first study, which has passed to the third phase of the domestic vaccines developed in our country, will be beneficial.
This vaccine, developed by Erciyes University and the Presidency of the Health Institutes of Turkey, is the most advanced study in our country. On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to thank our scientists who contributed to bringing our vaccine to this level.
I hope that the studies of our scientists who carry out other vaccine studies will be concluded as soon as possible.
With this vaccine, the first application of the third phase of which will be carried out a little later, Turkey is now opening the doors of a new era in this regard. Vaccines are the most effective and common tool known in the world in the fight against the epidemic. Turkey, China and Germany are at a very advanced level in the supply and application of all vaccines that have achieved concrete results. Hopefully, in a few weeks, we will have the entire population over the age of 18 in our country covered by vaccination. As we make progress in the fight against the pandemic and vaccination, we are lifting or reducing the restrictions one by one.
With the beginning of June, we had already started the openings that would allow our nation to breathe easily in many areas, and yesterday, after our Cabinet Meeting, we shared our struggle and good news with our nation on many issues, especially the curfews, with the month of July. Although the vaccines we procure from outside are important, the main thing is to produce our own vaccine, because it is uncertain how long this epidemic will last and how many more mutations it will have. It is critical that we have our own vaccine in order to get our country out of the grip of the pandemic as soon as possible and to ensure the health and prosperity of our nation. With this study, which has moved to the third phase, we have now entered the last turn in having our own vaccine. I hope that this stage will be completed within the stipulated time and the mass production and widespread use of our vaccine will be started.
I urge our citizens to fulfill their responsibilities to protect themselves and their loved ones from this scourge by getting vaccinated as soon as possible.
Once again, I wish this study to be beneficial and thank our scientists and citizens who will participate in the third phase applications.
Stay healthy.

Dear Representatives of the American Business World,
Dear Investors,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and respect. I am very pleased to be with you. I would like to thank everyone who brought us together, even if it was online.
I would like to express my gratitude to all entrepreneurs who believe in Turkey's potential and trust in the bright future of our country.
I hope that our meeting and the consultations we will hold will be beneficial in advance. Today, I would like to listen to you more, learn your views and opinions, and evaluate joint investment opportunities.
As you know, the global economy is going through the most painful period of the last century due to the developments caused by the coronavirus epidemic. The past 1.5 years have brought many challenges for both companies and governments. World economies, with a few exceptions, have experienced very serious contractions. In particular, companies operating in the aviation, tourism and services sectors were adversely affected by the restrictions taken against the epidemic. Again, in this period, we have seen the value of strong health infrastructure and investments in health services.
None of the troubles, disruptions in the supply chain and security weaknesses experienced in many countries during the epidemic period were experienced in Turkey. The city hospitals, which we implemented with a public-private partnership, and the two emergency hospitals with 1008 beds each, which we put into service in record time, played a critical role, especially during the epidemic period. We are close to 29 million doses of vaccine, which is the most effective method against the pandemic. We aim to ensure normalization throughout our country by carrying out an intensive vaccination campaign, especially in June.
As Turkey, we have differentiated positively not only in health but also in the fields of investment, employment, production, logistics, public security and social supports during the epidemic period. At a time when many economies in the world have come to a standstill, we have continued our investments in both the public and private sectors. Although the pandemic brought with it some difficulties for everyone, we opened new windows of opportunity in front of Turkey. In the search for alternatives to the Asia-based production network, Turkey's name has started to come to the fore more with its industry, production capacity, competitive prices, qualified workforce, geographical location, and strong infrastructure.
During the epidemic period, many of our companies had the opportunity to open up to countries and regions where they had never had a presence before or had a limited market share. Thanks to the efforts of our private sector, the support provided by our government and the dynamic pandemic measures, our economy closed 2020 with growth. With a rate of 1.8 percent, it was the country with the highest growth in the G-20 after China. Again, in this period, we were among the states with the highest increase in industrial production in the G-20. Despite the serious economic shrinkage in our traditional export markets and the contraction in foreign demand, we reached an export figure of 170 billion dollars. In the same period, the trade volume between Turkey and the United States increased by 4 percent to more than $21 billion. As the negative effects of the pandemic decrease in the world and the stones fall into place in the economy, the speed of Turkey's momentum is increasing.
The fact that we survived 2020 with confidence enabled us to make a strong start to 2021. In the January-April period of 2021, our exports increased by 33.1 percent compared to last year and reached 68 billion 752 million dollars. We see that the increase in foreign trade between our countries also contributes to the formation of this optimistic picture.
In the first 4 months of 2021, our exports increased by 45 percent compared to the same period of the previous year and reached 4 billion 272 million dollars. Next week, we will see the growth figures for the first quarter of 2021, leading data indicate that we will achieve a very strong growth rate in the first quarter. Our industrial production increased by 12.3 percent in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of the previous year.
Despite the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we observe a significant increase in investment demand in Turkey. In 2020, when international direct investments decreased by 42 percent, Turkey managed to attract approximately 8 billion dollars of direct investment. U.S. total direct investments in Turkey reached $13 billion, while Turkish firms' investments in the U.S. reached $7.2 billion.
On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all American companies that trust Turkey and the Turkish economy.
I believe that we will make Turkey, which is the heart of three continents, a global production and technology base with your support.
Dear Friends,
We attach great importance to our long-standing, multidimensional alliance relationship with the United States. Despite the differences of opinion from time to time, our partnership and alliance relations have managed to overcome all kinds of difficulties. We have serious potential for cooperation with the U.S. in a wide range of areas from Syria to Libya, from the fight against terrorism to energy, from trade to investments. We want to make rapid progress by operating the existing mechanisms between our countries. We need to put in place such mechanisms as the Economic Partnership Council, the Economic and Trade Strategic Cooperation Framework, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement Council. In order to achieve our goal of a trade volume of 100 billion dollars, we need a sincere, respectful approach based on common interests and values.
Steps such as additional tariffs in the steel and aluminum sector, exclusion of Turkey from the generalized system of preferences, and anti-dumping measures against export products of Turkish origin do not suit us. We expect the U.S. to act more constructively on these issues.
Although President Biden's statement on the events of 1915 puts an additional burden on our relations, I believe that the meeting we will hold with Mr. Biden at the NATO Summit will herald a new era.
As Turkey, we are determined to take the necessary steps in both trade and investments. We are glad to see that the new American administration has the same will as us in the development of our economic and trade relations.
Despite the various injustices we have faced so far, we have shown maximum sensitivity to ensure that politics does not harm our investment and commercial relations. We have always supported international companies that invest in our country, create employment and contribute to our economic development. Even during the pandemic, when the free market economy and rules-based international trade were eroded for the sake of short-term gains, we never resorted to protectionist policies in trade. In particular, we have never given the opportunity for distorted mentalities such as hostility to foreign capital, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism to find a foothold in our society.
We have kept our communication channels open with the investment community, both through our relevant ministries and our Investment Office. In addition, we have never departed from our reform agenda for the last 19 years. Just as we have focused on the problems we have faced so far, we are doing the same today. We resolutely continue our efforts to reform the economy, freedoms, law and justice according to changing conditions and needs.
We recently presented our Human Rights Action Plan and Economic Reform Package to the public. In the process leading up to 2023, we also declared our intention to save our country from the coup constitution and have a new civilian constitution. Also in this period, we prepared the Turkey International Direct Investment Strategy Document. Thus, we have defined the value-added investments that our country needs. We have determined the responsibilities of our institutions in order to attract these investments. Hopefully, we will soon share our document with our nation and international investors.
We want to increase our country's annual share of international direct investments by 50 percent in the medium term. To this end, we will simplify our incentive system and make it easier for investors to benefit from incentives. While increasing the amount of investments, we attach special importance to projects that will accelerate the technological transformation of our country, create employment and make a positive contribution to our current account balance. We will continue to attract international investors in certain areas, especially in information and communication technologies, energy and logistics. Our Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industry and Technology, Presidency Investment and Digital Transformation Offices and other institutions are ready to provide you with all kinds of support in your new investment projects.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank each of you individually, and now I would like to receive your questions and evaluations.
Thank you.

Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
Dear Secretary General,
Dear Representatives of International Organizations,
Dear Delegates,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings on behalf of myself and my nation. I would like to thank the United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Guterres and the Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica for their meaningful initiative.
The Covid-19 pandemic, which we have left behind a year, has revealed that the fate of all humanity is common in the face of global problems. As Turkey, we have strived to strengthen global solidarity and international cooperation in this struggle from the very beginning. With this understanding, we have provided medical assistance and support to 157 countries and 12 international organizations. In particular, we did not leave our African brothers and sisters alone in these difficult days. Between 2009 and 2019, we provided over $2.5 billion in official development assistance to the least developed countries alone.
The Covid-19 pandemic has once again exposed the distortions in the global system, which we express on almost every platform. The global pandemic, which caught even the richest countries of the world unprepared, caused serious destruction, especially in underdeveloped countries. The injustice, which has become even more evident with the epidemic, has become much more serious with the vaccine issue. We see that nearly 100 countries around the world still have not yet reached the vaccine.
On the one hand, there are countries that have vaccinated almost all of their population, and on the other hand, billions of people cannot access even the first dose of vaccine, which is a worrying situation for humanity and human values. However, it is obvious that the pandemic will not end and economic recovery will not take place without ensuring equitable access to vaccines. Countries that have reached enough doses to vaccinate their own citizens need to deliver their surplus vaccines to countries in need. When our domestic vaccine studies are completed, we anticipate to offer our vaccine to the use of all humanity under the most favorable conditions.
It is also important that the economic recovery is carried out with an understanding based on cooperation and solidarity instead of protectionist reflexes. I think that the steps on the allocation of special drawing rights, which were also on the agenda at the G-20, should be concluded as soon as possible.
On the other hand, I hope that the 16th general quota review of the International Monetary Fund will meet the justified expectations of developing countries.
Along with strengthening liquidity facilities, we attach importance to easing the debt burdens of low-income countries.
The G-20 debt relief initiative is an important step we have taken to minimize the effects of the pandemic. We consider it beneficial to extend the debt relief initiative for the second time to cover the whole of 2021.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I emphasize again the importance of acting jointly in solidarity and cooperation in this difficult process. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the organization of the event and greet you once again with respect.

First of all, at the point of providing such a benevolent service, my Vice President Leyla brother Leyla knows that the place of the Silk Road in our history is very, very different. It is almost as if this is our way of birth and it is of great importance for us to uncover such a work in ElazÄ±Ä on the route of this birth path and to revive and build a generation that will continue this journey from now on. For this, of course, there will be all kinds of events here, they will live here.
Of course, all our ministerial friends who contributed to such a step, together with the step taken by our brother Leyla, and I would like to especially thank our Minister of Youth and Sports in this regard. In addition, he gave support to our Minister of Industry and Technology, right, his right and left are not clear for him. Did ethnosport or anything like that come here? You have a partnership, okay.
And with these events, I believe that the Silk Road will make a very different sound. Hopefully, we will hear this voice not from Ankara, but from all of Turkey, I firmly believe in it. Regarding this issue, all my fellow deputies should give all the support they can here. I think that the voice of this place should be heard all over Turkey with events, and even to the world with ethnosports. And on this occasion, I congratulate and congratulate all my brothers and sisters who contributed, from architects to engineers and workers. And in this process, of course, it is important that our current Governor, our future governors, our Mayor, our mayors, all of them have their support here. And I believe that this journey of ours will lead to great benefits. I wish you good luck again. I pray that God will help us.

Dear people of Gaziantep,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. From here, I send my greetings and love to all my brothers and sisters from Gaziantep with their districts and localities. I wish that the DÃ¼zbaÄ Drinking Water Supply Line and DoÄanpÄ±nar Dam, which we have opened, will be beneficial to our Gaziantep, our region and our country.
At a time when the coronavirus epidemic affects our country as well as the world, we do not compromise on our health services or our investments. With the measures we have implemented, we have slowed down the rate of increase of the epidemic. Hopefully, we will start to lift the restrictions gradually as the number of cases and serious patients falls below the levels we target. For this, 83 million people must strictly comply with the rules of cleaning, masks and distance, which we abbreviate as ""TMM"".
We did not leave any member of our nation unattended during the epidemic period. We have taken all necessary measures to maintain production and employment, and we have provided all kinds of support. Within the scope of the social protection shield, we have put a resource of 45 billion liras at the disposal of our nation free of charge under the title of short-time working allowance, cash wage support, unemployment allowance, normalization support and household-based social support program. Thus, we tried to ensure that none of our citizens were left unemployed and unvaccinated. We have never forgotten the farmer and the shopkeeper. In addition, we are making arrangements in rents and so on, and we will probably announce them as our Ministry of Treasury and Finance in a short time after our Cabinet meeting.
We have implemented many support programs to meet the financing needs of our industrialists, small and medium-sized enterprises and tradesmen. Thankfully, we have brought such a comprehensive health and economic crisis, which even developed countries have difficulty coping with, to this day without causing any destruction or mass misery. In terms of the level reached in vaccine studies, we hope that we look at the upcoming period with much more hope. We have largely completed the connections of the vaccines we need until the date when the domestic vaccine will be activated. As of next spring, we are working with all our strength to bring everything to the best possible level within the framework of the reality of the epidemic.
With the belief that the way out is investment, production, export and employment, we are in the preparations for reforms that will make our country a center of attraction again. With legal and administrative reforms, we aim to put our country in the top 10 in the restructured global, political and economic order. Hopefully, we will achieve our goals together by firmly protecting our unity, solidarity and brotherhood, nullifying all internal and external threats to our country, strengthening our democracy and economy.
Dear Friends,
Water is life, and since our country does not have rich water resources, it is imperative that we use our existing opportunities in the most efficient way. As it is known, we are having a very dry year. In this period when precipitation rates have decreased by almost half, we need to pay attention to water conservation together. Due to the threat of the epidemic, there has been a significant increase in the use of water for cleaning purposes. As institutions and citizens, we need to work hand in hand to manage water that is both effective and economical.
Just like in health, we have made very serious investments in the evaluation of water resources, considering such troubled times. In the last 18 years, we have built 585 dams, 584 hydroelectric power plants, 385 ponds, 1382 irrigation facilities, 247 drinking water facilities, and nearly 5 thousand flood protection facilities. We must act carefully until our dams are filled with water again, supplementing our means with small measures. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of our State Hydraulic Works for their efforts and efforts in bringing these values to our country.
The DÃ¼zbaÄ Drinking Water Project, which will meet the water needs of Gaziantep until 2050, is the second largest drinking water project in our country. This work, whose project belongs to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality and whose construction belongs to the State Hydraulic Works, transports the water of GÃ¶ksu Stream, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates, to Gaziantep. Thanks to the natural slope supply of water, 110 million cubic meters of water has been supplied to our city so far without a single penny of energy costs. Thus, our municipality had the opportunity to provide quality and cheap drinking water services to our citizens. As a matter of fact, our Municipality immediately reflected this advantage to our people by making a 27 percent discount on drinking water.
The first stage, which we put into service, has the capacity to transfer approximately 100 million cubic meters of water annually. When the dam and the other stage with the treatment plant are commissioned, this figure will increase to 174 million cubic meters.
DoÄantepe Dam, on the other hand, is a source of fertility project that will irrigate an area of 80 thousand decares with a water storage capacity of 153 million cubic meters. This dam, which took 7 years to build and has a height of 55.5 meters and a cost of 660 million liras, will contribute 51 million liras per year to our country and provide additional employment to 28 thousand people when the irrigation channels are completed.
We are transforming the region between Gaziantep and Kilis into one of the most important agricultural production centers of our country by adding 80 thousand decares with the DoÄanpÄ±nar Dam and irrigation to our lands, of which 120 thousand hectares are currently irrigated with the KayacÄ±k Dam and irrigation. In the first stage, we will raise 18 thousand hectares for the next irrigation season, and we will complete the rest gradually.
Of course, these are not the only dam and pond investments in Gaziantep. I leave aside what has been completed so far. We have many investments that are still in the project and construction phase. For example, 75 percent physical realization has been achieved in the Ãetintepe Dam, which will irrigate 600 thousand decares of land. The irrigation projects of the KayacÄ±k and Rehberlu dams continue stage by stage. The construction of Yesemek and BurÃ§ ÃamlÄ±k ponds continues. The tender for the Nizip Pumped Irrigation, Grouting and Protection Measures Work, which will irrigate 35 thousand areas in Nizip and KarkamÄ±Å, is ready.
As you can see, we are working hard to ensure that Gaziantep, along with the other 80 provinces of our country, benefits from the blessings given to us by our Lord, from drinking water to irrigation water, in the best way possible.
Dear Friends,
Gaziantep is a city that we show as an example not only in our country but also everywhere we go in the world with its historical and cultural riches, industry, agriculture, trade, trained human resources, determination and hard work. Our city, which has two-thirds of the industry in our region, also carries out almost all of the region's foreign trade. With its 1000 companies in 6 organized industrial zones and 10 thousand tradesmen in 10 different small industrial sites, Gaziantep works like a living factory.
Of course, there are various problems brought about by this dynamism.Â  For example, approximately 15 thousand heavy vehicles enter and exit the city every day. For this, a strong infrastructure is needed in both intercity transportation and urban transportation. A storage area integrated with the industrial zone will reduce the burden of HGV traffic on the city. With the logistics village project to be established on an area of 500 hectares, the preliminary preparations of which are still being carried out, we will bring a dry port to Gaziantep connected to Mersin and Iskenderun ports. The rapid construction of Organized Industry connection roads will also facilitate the arrival of raw materials and product output to production facilities.
We are bringing a new and modern terminal building and parking lot to our airport. This project, which is under construction, should be completed as soon as possible.
The suburban line project, which will connect the city center and industrial zones, will significantly relieve Gaziray traffic. 12 of the 16 stations of the project, which is under construction, have been completed. Hopefully, we will finish the remaining part quickly and put this important project into the service of the people of Gaziantep as soon as possible. 50 percent progress has been made in the BahÃ§e-NurdaÄÄ± section of the high-speed train line and in the NurdaÄÄ±-BaÅpÄ±nar section.
The divided road works connecting the city to all four sides continue stage by stage, and the completed parts are put into service.
It seems that the car ferries in the Lower Euphrates basin are not used efficiently enough. The proposal to replace these ferries with boats suitable for use in dams in our region, which is increasingly active in tourism, can be considered in terms of both cost and efficiency.
We are building a city hospital with 1875 beds in Gaziantep. I see that the construction of the hospital is going a little slowly. Within the framework of both the potential of the region and the needs arising from the global health crises, we will ensure that our city hospital is completed as soon as possible.
To date, we have brought approximately 20 thousand houses to our city with shops, mosques, schools and health centers through TOKI. With the Northern City Project, we are building 50 thousand more residences in Gaziantep, which will be a new source of breath for our city. In this project, where a level of 10 percent has been reached in the construction of houses, infrastructures such as roads, sewerage and stormwater have been completed to a large extent.
We offered Hasan Celal GÃ¼zel and Green Valley public gardens to the service of our city. The construction of the national garden, which was built on the site of the old stadium, continues. In addition, we are making preparations for two more national gardens in Nizip and OÄuzeli.
Only the amount of TOKI's ongoing investments in our city exceeds 1 billion liras.
We built one of the most beautiful and modern stadiums of our country in Gaziantep with a capacity of 33 thousand people. In addition, we have facilitated the access of our young people to sports by bringing 31 different halls to our neighborhoods.
As the President, I am determined to personally support every investment that will improve the potential of Gaziantep.
With these feelings, I wish that our transmission line and dam, which we have opened once again, will be beneficial to our city and our country.
While I offer my love and respect to you, I say quickly from here; Let's zoom in on the dams, ponds, etc., that have been built right now, and let all our people watch these works on the screen.
On the one hand, dams, on the other hand, giant transmission lines, let's watch them as a nation.
AK Party government means service power. If Aleppo is there right now, as you can see at the opening ceremony of the Gaziantep DÃ¼zbaÄ Drinking Water Transmission Line and the DoÄanpÄ±nar Dam. These are not words, they are actions.
Of course, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the contractor companies.
Dear friends, you have the scissors and ribbons, at the same time, I have my esteemed minister friends at the head of the buttons, we have our Mayor. We cut the ribbons together, the scissors are a memory of today.
Greetings to you from Istanbul. Ya Allah Bismillah.

Mr. President of the General Assembly,
Dear Secretary General,
Honourable Presidents of the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council,
Dear Delegates,
I salute you with respect on behalf of myself and my nation. I hope that our meeting will be successful and will be beneficial for all humanity.
The international community is facing the greatest global challenge of the 21st century. The key to overcoming this challenging period is international cooperation and global solidarity. That is why this session has been so timely and useful. As the Chairman-in-Office of the Non-Aligned Movement, I would like to thank everyone who supported the organization of the special session, especially my dear brother Mr. Aliyev, who led this initiative, and Mr. BozkÄ±r, the President of the General Assembly.
Dear Delegates,
As Turkey, we have acted in cooperation with the international community since the first days of the pandemic. In addition to the United Nations, we have always been at the forefront of activities in the World Health Organization, G20, MIKTA, Turkic Council, Organization of Islamic Cooperation and other international platforms. To date, we have provided assistance to 156 countries and 9 international organizations.
We support countries and regions that have food safety problems under epidemic conditions, and we carry out special programs in 16 countries for disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, disabled and orphaned children. In some developing countries, we organize training programs for the production of personal protective equipment using local resources.
We are trying to provide budget support to some countries that are facing economic difficulties due to the pandemic. Our private sector also contributes to our efforts in the public sector. To date, more than 50 Turkish companies have supported more than 20 countries in their fight against the epidemic in various ways.
The world has pinned its hopes on the news within the scope of vaccine production. On this occasion, I would like to congratulate Professor UÄur Åahin and Doctor Ãzlem TÃ¼reci, the founders of BioNTech Company, who have achieved a significant success in vaccine studies and participated in the session online, on behalf of myself and my nation.
We are also very pleased that one of the 16 vaccine studies we have carried out, 12 of which are on the World Health Organization list, has started human trials.
As a result of the efforts led by our country, 2021 was declared the International Year of Health Workers by the World Health Organization. In this context, I would like to express my gratitude to all healthcare professionals who work selflessly all over the world.
The World Health Organization Geographically Discrete Office for Preparedness for Humanitarian and Health Emergencies was opened in Istanbul in September. This office, which is a manifestation of Turkey's support for the work of the World Health Organization, will strengthen the efforts carried out against the pandemic.
Dear Delegates,
As Turkey, our strong agriculture, food and manufacturing sector, city hospitals, experienced and devoted health workers, and our encompassing social security system have been the most important advantages of our country in this process.
There are vulnerable groups all over the world that are more affected by this process. It is essential that the measures are inclusive and that the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are taken care of. With this in mind, we attach special importance to the protection of the rights of women, children, the elderly and the disabled.
3.6 million Syrians under our protection can benefit from health services in our country just like our citizens.
We are aware that the Covid-19 disease will be with us for a while. As a matter of fact, the increase in the number of cases, patients and deaths around the world in recent weeks reminds us all of this fact. In this process, it is necessary to fight not only the pandemic but also the increasing Islamophobia, xenophobia and racism.
As you know, we have supported the debt relief initiative initiated by the G20 Platform, of which we are a member, from the very beginning. I would like to remind you that we have to accelerate our efforts to ensure the transition to the new normal, including sustainable supply chains and distribution networks.
The pandemic has also reminded us of the need to reform the United Nations system in light of today's threats and needs. I believe that the General Assembly needs to be strengthened to make the United Nations system more effective, democratic, fair and transparent.
In closing, I hope that the special session will give impetus to the international community's fight against the pandemic.
I would like to thank everyone who took part in the execution of the program and greet you once again with my heartfelt feelings.
Stay healthy.

Dear Members of the Turkish Armed Forces,
Our commandos, who are the apple of our nation's eye, a source of pride, a monument of courage and victory,
Dear Guests,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. We have just handed over our Brigade Banner, which is the trust of our nation, to Staff Colonel SÃ¼leyman Akbay. You know best the meaning and importance of the banner in military service, and that it is a blessed trust that must be protected at the cost of one's life when necessary. Praise be to God, the banner of any unit of the Turkish Army did not fall to the ground without the last soldier dying.
At every moment and on every front of our struggle, which has been going on uninterruptedly for a thousand years in the homeland, our ancestors have written many epics with this understanding. Today, you prove every day that you are the glorious descendants of that glorious ancestor with the victories you have achieved. There is no greater honor, no greater happiness than to bear the title of Commander-in-Chief of such an army.
Every element of the Turkish Armed Forces, every soldier is, of course, an integral part of the victories won and its honor. Our commando units, which have been fighting at the forefront of every front throughout their history and showing the world what it means to scare death, have a special place in the hearts of our nation.
You are our heroes who have shown on the fronts that you are the greatest guarantee of our country's independence and future with your faith, heart, wrist, courage and determination. You, as commandos who make the mountains tremble and bring a climate of peace to the plains they pass, are the fear of the enemy and the terrorist, and the source of confidence of our nation and our friends. Whoever covets our homeland, our flag and our call to prayer knows that a bitter fate awaits him at the hands of our commandos. Whoever covets the unity, solidarity and future of our nation will find our commandos in front of him.
Our nation, which built the feeling embodied in our National Anthem and will hopefully preserve it forever, is always with our commandos.
A commando who speaks with his heart and wrist does not need many words. May your gaza be blessed, your path clear, your shots accurate, your heart spacious, your victory abundant, may Allah help you.
On this occasion, I commemorate with mercy all our martyrs, veterans and heroes who have entered the soil as if falling into a rose garden for a thousand years to preserve this land as our homeland. I pray that Allah will protect and triumph our heroes who are still on duty in the fight against terrorism and in our operations along our borders and beyond our borders.
I greet you with love and respect.
Stay healthy.

Mr. President, Dear Brother,
Distinguished Representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
Honourable Ministers,
Dear Members of the Committee,
I greet you with my heartfelt respect. I pray to my Lord that our meeting and the consultations we will hold will be beneficial for our countries.
Our High-Level Cooperation mechanism is one of the signs of Turkey-Iran friendship. To date, we have made many important decisions within the scope of the council. We held our fifth meeting in Ankara in 2018. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we had to hold this meeting via video conference. Despite this, the fact that we have shown the will to hold our meeting is an important message. The dialogue between Turkey and Iran has a decisive role in the solution of many regional problems.
I believe that with the easing of the epidemic conditions, our cooperation will return to its previous levels.
On this occasion, I wish God's mercy on the Iranian citizens who lost their lives in the Covid-19 epidemic and a speedy recovery to our brothers and sisters who are undergoing treatment.
In the early stages of the pandemic, we showed that we were with the Iranian people with the medical equipment and aid materials we sent. I believe that by acting in solidarity, we will overcome this epidemic together as all humanity.
As Turkey, we continue to keep the epidemic under control despite the increasing number of cases in recent days. On the one hand, we are strengthening our health system in the new hospitals we have equipped with the latest technology, and on the other hand, we are trying to put our economy on track in production, exports and tourism.
In the Qur'an, our Lord gives us the good news that there is definitely an ease with every difficulty. Hopefully, I think that we will come out of this epidemic process together as Turkey and Iran as the countries of the region.
Today, our friends will contribute to our council on all these issues related to our bilateral and international cooperation. I believe that the decisions we will take here today will accelerate the issues that are being pursued in our bilateral relations. Of course, our ministers have important duties in the implementation of these decisions. I would like to reiterate my desire to meet with you as soon as possible after overcoming the epidemic calamity.
I would like to thank you and wish that our meeting will be beneficial for our countries.

Dear Fellow Citizens,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Youth,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. After about a year of separation, we are once again in Rize, the ancestral land, to meet with you. We praise our Lord, who has brought us to this day and brought us to our heavenly homeland.
As usual, we did not come to Rize empty-handed. On this occasion, we are also holding the opening ceremony of 33 items, works and services with a total investment value of 525 million liras.
Among the works we have inaugurated are ArdeÅen, Pazar, Ãayeli, Kalkandere, FÄ±ndÄ±klÄ± and Anatolian imam hatip high schools, vocational high schools, kindergartens, workshop building and additional buildings built in the center. We are also opening the bridge junction built by our university with beach embankment.
Today, we are officially opening investments such as Ayder's roads and infrastructure, sewerage, drinking water, wastewater facilities in various districts, stream improvement, and bicycle path in the center.
Today, we are inaugurating an urban transformation project of TOKI with 93 residences and 20 shops and another project of 150 residences. Today, we are putting into service the new service buildings of our Police Directorate, Gendarmerie Command, AFAD, and 112 call center. Today, we are officially opening the investments in dormitory buildings, swimming pool, football fields, neighborhood fields, and youth center. I wish all these investments to be beneficial to our country and our city.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate everyone, especially our ministers and their teams, who contributed to bringing these investments to our city.
We will continue to make all kinds of investments necessary to evaluate the God-given beauties of Rize. Hopefully, all the work on Rize's famous logistics center has been done so far, the tender is complete, and after that, I hope the construction will start quickly and we will implement the logistics center at the entrance of Rize.
On the other hand, the construction of Rize-Artvin Airport is currently continuing rapidly, as a matter of fact, I will go to inspect there tomorrow and we will personally inspect the construction of the airport on site and see it.
On the one hand, we will protect the environment, and on the other hand, we will look for ways to make the most of these opportunities. We are determined to put Turkey's values in our region, as well as its potential in other fields, at the disposal of our nation. We have been working day and night for this, not only today, but for the last 18 years. In the last 18 years, we have invested over 20 billion liras in Rize.
We have built one thousand 875 new classrooms in education. We opened dormitory buildings with a capacity of 5,296 people for higher education students. We will open more dormitory buildings with a total capacity of 2,250 people in Rize, Ãayeli and GÃ¼neysu.
We have built swimming pools, athlete factories, youth centers, sports halls, camp training centers, and football fields all over our city. The construction of Rize Water Sports Facility, FÄ±ndÄ±klÄ± Youth Center, Kalkandere and ÃamlÄ±hemÅin sports halls, and the tender for ArdeÅen Youth Center continues. Work on our public gardens that we will build in Rize, GÃ¼neysu and Ä°yidere continues.
We will bring our city to a new symbol with our tea bazaar project, which will bring together Rize's world brand tea and tourism. We will complete the tea bazaar, which will include recreation areas, tea presentation and tasting center, and training center, by September next year.
We transferred a total of 879 million liras to our citizens in need in our city. In healthcare, we have built a total of 28 health facilities, 10 of which are hospitals.
On this occasion, I wish God's mercy on our young and dynamic Professor Doctor Turhan ErdoÄan, whom we bid farewell to the eternal world yesterday.
Despite his young age, Dr. Turhan was a scientist who made great contributions to our university and our city in the field of cardiac surgery. He could not get rid of this notorious coronavirus epidemic. May Allah surround him with His mercy and mercy, let us recite a Fatiha to his soul, al-Fatiha.
The land process of the 800-bed city hospital, which we will bring to our country, and the project work of the 50-bed Ãayeli State Hospital continue.
We have increased the length of the divided road, which we took over from 20 kilometers in transportation, to 167 kilometers. We have put Ä°kizdere-Ä°spir road, Ovit Tunnel and connection roads into service. We restored the historical bridges of OrtakÃ¶y, KantarlÄ±, DiktaÅ and Koca KÃ¶prÃ¼. Hopefully, we will complete a significant part of the projects under construction next year.
We are intensively continuing the construction of our Rize-Artvin airport, which is our second airport built on the sea. Tomorrow I will personally go and inspect the construction on site. We plan to put our airport, which has an annual capacity of 3 million passengers, into service in 2022.
In 2002, 24.4 million liras were paid as fresh tea premium and pruning support, and we made 176 million lira support payments in 2019. In addition, we have provided 2.5 billion liras of fresh tea premium and pruning support to our Rizeli farmers in the last 18 years. While 378 thousand tons of tea was purchased by ÃAYKUR in Rize in 2002, we increased the amount of tea purchased in 2019 to 517 thousand tons. In the last 18 years, we have paid a total of 6.5 billion liras to our producers in return for the purchase of fresh tea. We announced this year's tea prices, and I was pleased with the news I received. I hope you will have a fruitful harvest period and make abundant profits.
In the last 8 years, we have provided a total of 40.4 million liras of area-based support for hazelnuts. We have also announced this year's hazelnut prices at a very satisfactory level.
In order to meet the drinking water needs of Rize, we delivered the water we received from Varda and Andon springs to our city with the facility we built. In addition, we will transmit water to the settlements through the second part of the 85-kilometer-long diarrhea line from the Varda springs.
In order to protect our citizens from floods, we have built 58 flood protection facilities in the last 18 years, thus protecting the city center, 104 settlements and 17 thousand decares of land from flood damages. Currently, construction work is underway on 21 flood protection facilities.
We brought natural gas to Rize, GÃ¼neysu, ArdeÅen, Ãayeli, FÄ±ndÄ±klÄ±, DerepazarÄ±, Ä°yidere and Pazar, and I hope we will bring it to Tetovo by the end of this year.
Dear Brothers and Sisters.
As you can see, the number of things we have done is endless. These are the reflections of the AK Party's 19-year service policy only in Rize. Thankfully, each of our 81 provinces has benefited from this service spring and has taken on a brand new face beyond solving its age-old problems.
Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the establishment of the AK Party. It was the anniversary, and as of November, we will have left behind the 18th year of our government. We have had the honor of spending a period of time in power that exceeds the total life of many political parties in the world. In particular, our nation does not give us the title of being the first party in every election we enter by looking at our black eyebrows and black eyes, our nation looks at the service, looks at the stance, looks at the word spoken, looks at the work done, and makes its decision accordingly. Those who think that they can deceive the nation by creating a cadres with lies, slander, shady dealings, and hostility to their country and nation are soon revealed. We have experienced this truth many times from the past to the present. Those who are not sincere, those who have aspirations, projects and plans other than love for the country and nation in their hearts will eventually show their true faces.
We will continue on our way, not by looking at who says what, but by looking at what our nation wants and in which direction it is pointing. We will not allow our energy to be divided, our time wasted, and our attention distracted by unnecessary discussions. We are currently focused on minimizing the negative effects of the pandemic. Right now, we are focused on getting our economy back on its feet. We are currently focused on protecting our rights in the Eastern Mediterranean, Libya and the Aegean until the end. Right now, we are focused on blocking terrorist organizations in Syria and northern Iraq. At the moment, we are focused on achieving the rights and interests of our country in every field at the highest level in all parts of the world. This is Turkey's real problems and its real agenda, and the debates other than this are just a trap that someone knowingly and who unknowingly falls into.
Of course, if there is a problem somewhere, it is our duty to listen to it and look for a solution, but steps can be taken in this direction, provided that each problem is kept in its own channel and diameter. We cannot turn a blind eye to those who try to take the debates out of their own channel and turn them into a wedge in front of the blessed march of the country and the nation. We will never allow those who try to see their own agendas and the showdowns in their own minds through us, sorry.
As a party that has solved many problems of Turkey, implemented many reforms, and taken many steps that were said to be unavoidable, we ask our nation to trust us. We trust our nation and we will continue to walk on this path, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with our nation. Hopefully, tomorrow will be better than today.
With these feelings, I wish that the 33 works and facilities that we have opened once again will be beneficial to our city, and I especially congratulate all contractor companies, especially my ministerial friends, and all contractors from architects to engineers.
I offer you my love and respect, with good health.

Dear colleagues, Mr. Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as Mr. Putin, President of the Russian Federation,
Dear Members of the Committee,
I greet you with my heartfelt respect. I hope that our meeting will be beneficial for our countries and our region.
I am pleased to meet with you on the sixth of our Syria-themed summit meetings, albeit via video conference.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are all in a difficult struggle. First of all, I would like to express our sadness over the loss of life caused by the epidemic in Iran and Russia. On behalf of myself and my nation, I express my condolences to the Iranian and Russian peoples. I wish a speedy recovery to the patients who are still being treated.
Yesterday, we learned that 19 of our Iranian brothers were killed and 6 others were injured in an explosion in a clinic in Tehran. On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to express my condolences for the Iranian citizens who lost their lives in this tragic accident.
As Turkey, we have helped our friends and brothers as well as providing the best health services to our citizens in the process of combating the epidemic. We have provided medical aid and material support to 137 countries of the world. We managed to reduce the number of deaths per day to 16. We hope that our world will get rid of this calamity, which has cost the lives of more than half a million people, as soon as possible.
The Trilateral Summit process in the Astana Format, which we launched in November 2017, has made significant contributions to the establishment of peace, security and stability in Syria. Preserving Syria's political unity and territorial integrity, establishing calm on the ground and finding a lasting political solution to the conflict are our main priorities. I believe that we will continue this momentum with today's meeting.
As Turkey, we have stood by our Syrian brothers and sisters since the beginning of the conflict. We have embraced millions of Syrian refugees, regardless of their ethnic identity, origin or belief. We have shown great sensitivity to prevent Syria from being torn apart by terrorist organizations. By intervening when necessary, we prevented the human tragedy and divisive ambitions. We will continue to do our best to ensure that our neighbor Syria regains peace, security and stability as soon as possible. The cooperation we will exhibit as the guarantors of Astana will undoubtedly determine the future of this country.
I see today's meeting as a step towards this ideal, and I thank you in advance for your contributions.
I pray to my Lord that the consultations we will hold will be beneficial for our Syrian brothers and our entire region.
Thank you.

Dear Representatives of Our Institutions and Non-Governmental Organizations,
I greet you with love and respect. Welcome to our evaluation meeting on the coronavirus, also known as the Covid-19 disease, which affects our country as well as the whole world.
At the press conference we will hold after our meeting, we will explain in detail the process of this disease in the world and in our country. Therefore, after a short introductory speech, we will focus on the discussion of the measures we will take for the upcoming period.
To date, we have gradually implemented health measures and other measures to keep the disease under control, and we continue to do so. Such a process, which brings daily life to a standstill due to voluntary or compulsory quarantine practices, will have serious economic consequences as well as many dimensions. As Turkey, we have an obligation to prevent this disease from turning into an epidemic and to keep production, trade, employment and the economy alive. At a time when our country is just getting rid of the effects of the exchange rate, interest rate and inflation attack we experienced in August 2018 and things are starting to get back on track, we can never let go of the end of the rope.
Of course, it is not easy to ensure that the wheels of the entire economy continue to turn with its industry and trade while fighting against Covid-19. For this reason, in addition to the duties of the state, it is certain that our private sector also has responsibilities to fulfill. Hopefully, we will achieve this challenge together with the decisions we will take here today. When we get our country out of this process safely, we can already see that much greater opportunities await us than before. Of course, I believe that we will overcome this process with patience on the one hand and prayer on the other.
The epidemic period in China has pushed the whole world, especially Europe, to look for alternatives in production. When it comes to alternatives in production, one of the first places that comes to mind is Turkey. In addition, developments in the field of finance in connection with the virus outbreak and the fall in oil prices will provide additional advantages to our country. If we manage the next few weeks well, inform our nation well, and keep the disease under strict control, a good picture awaits us beyond our expectations. The important thing is that we are able to demonstrate the resilience to overcome both the virus medically and its psychological and economic effects, without allowing the disease to defeat us. I trust you in this regard and I believe that we will overcome this together.
As you know, yesterday we had a quadripartite video conference with French President Macron, Merkel on the other side, Boris Johnson on the other side, and with this video conference, we did not only discuss this virus event, because when we make an assessment in them, we seem to be in the best position right now, Germany seems to be behind us.  but the situation of England, and of France on the other side, is incomparably worse than ours.
Of course, on the other hand, we had the opportunity to discuss the developments in the region, both the Idlib issue and the Peace Spring issue. And we had a briefing about the last summit we held in Moscow.
Of course, I hope that the decisions we will take regarding this virus will be beneficial for our country and our economy.

Speech Addressed to the Public in Malatya After Post-Earthquake Inspections,2020-01-25,"

As a result of the earthquake that took place at around 20:55 yesterday evening, we had natural losses both here and in our districts and neighborhoods in Elazig, may God have mercy on our losses. And I wish patience to all their relatives on behalf of myself, my nation, I wish patience on behalf of my fellow ministers, I wish patience on behalf of my fellow deputies, I wish patience on behalf of my fellow mayors.
And we traveled around the earthquake zone in Elazig, and now we are with you in DoÄanyol. Here, too, we have 4 losses. Of course, when we look at the total, we have more than a thousand wounded. We visited our wounded in Elazig in the hospital, of course we have wounded people here, and I wish them a speedy recovery. I hope God will grant them to regain their health as soon as possible.
We are people who believe in accident and fate, we are Muslims, first and foremost. Both accident and fate are a requirement of our faith. With this belief, we take the steps that make our lives different. We just had a 5.1 magnitude aftershock. So these aftershocks are going on right now. In the demolished places, our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization will quickly carry out ground surveys, and we will save our citizens from these temporary tents and hopefully take them to their permanent residences with steel construction. And in addition to providing them with permanent housing, of course, they are here, especially in the village section, more precisely, since this is of course Malatya metropolitan city, there are no villages, there are neighborhoods, they have their own animals here, they have stables for them, all the project works will be carried out by our Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, and I hope we will complete these investments in a short time and deliver them to their owners with a joint work.
I would like to take this opportunity to wish God's mercy on those who died. Let's recite a Fatiha to the souls of all of them.
I wish God's healing to our wounded.
And I congratulate and congratulate you on this solidarity you have shown. I believe that this is a requirement of your faith and you have done this as a requirement of your faith, you have patiently overcome this process, and you are getting through it. May God protect us from the worst, God willing.
I entrust you to Allah.
Tomorrow morning we have a trip to Algeria, from there we have a trip to Gambia, from there we have a trip to Senegal. Of course, before going on these trips, I wanted to visit the earthquake zones. And alhamdulillah, we traveled around Elazig, now we are together with you, we will return to Istanbul from here.
Again, may God help us. Thank you, be present.
"
Their Speech After the Earthquake in Elazig,2020-01-25,"

Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen
We have just performed the funeral prayers of our sister AyÅegÃ¼l HanÄ±m and her beloved baby Muhammet Salih together. May my Lord make their place a Paradise and bring us together in His Paradise.
Of course, such disasters are a great test for us, and as a nation, we are a nation that has always patiently fulfilled such a test, and we have always given the best examples of being a Muslim and surrendering at this point. We have experienced the BingÃ¶l earthquake, we have experienced the Van earthquake, we have experienced Simav, we have experienced DÃ¼zce, we have experienced Sakarya, we have experienced the Bolu earthquake, we have experienced many earthquakes since the past. But this nation has been able to overcome them patiently in all these earthquakes, and it has succeeded. Now we are in a test again. As you know, Elazig is adjacent to Erzincan and you always know what kind of earthquakes we have experienced in Erzincan.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I would like to express this in particular: We have always given and continue to give the best surrender about these earthquake events, about which there is also a surah. Now we are faced with such a test. Our President of Religious Affairs just described this as a commentary on the apocalypse, that is, among those who know that the death of man is a mini-apocalypse, and this is how we experienced it. But I believe that these brothers and sisters are among those who have received the good news of my Lord's Paradise. Sabi, he is sinless. Mom, hakeza it is.
As a state, as a nation, we are doing our best until the end, God willing, and we will do it. Our work on all these wrecks will continue. In addition to this, of course, by removing these debris, on the other hand, I hope that we will take our steps and do what needs to be done as TOKI to replace these destructions in both villages and neighborhoods, and we will not leave anyone hungry, hungry and open.
I ask you to do this: Do not listen to any rumors, do not listen to anyone's negative propaganda and know that we are your servants and we are among those who know how great an honor it is to serve this nation.
Again, I ask for God's mercy on all our mawtas, the last time the number was 22. I say let's all read Fatiha to their souls again.

Heart of Asia Istanbul Process Ministerial Conference,2019-12-09,"

Distinguished Representatives of International and Regional Organizations,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, respect and affection. Together with Afghanistan, we are celebrating the 8th anniversary of the Heart of Asia Process, which we started here in our ancient city of Istanbul. Welcome to the Ministerial Conference.
On the occasion of this important meeting, I am very pleased to welcome you in our country. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your participation in the program.
I pray to my Lord that our conference will be beneficial for our countries, especially Afghanistan. We started this process eight years ago with great hopes and great excitement. I believe that the vast majority of the challenges facing Afghanistan can only be overcome through cooperation and solidarity. When we make the judgment and accounting of the past eight years, we see much better what a critical step we have taken for our region with the Istanbul process.
Many events we have experienced in recent years have repeatedly shown us the following truth: Mercy comes from unity, and torment comes from separation. Regional problems can only be overcome through regional ownership. No matter how complicated it is, there is no obstacle that cannot be overcome as long as there is solidarity and unity of power.
A significant part of the problems faced by our brothers and sisters living in South Asia originate outside their borders. People in this geography often have to grapple with the negative repercussions of developments in which they have no involvement. Regional cooperation and solidarity are essential for the South Asian Region and its immediate surroundings to overcome the problems they are facing. The Istanbul process has been an extremely useful platform for producing regional and local solutions in the face of these common challenges. The Istanbul process, which allows the region's problems to be addressed with a spirit of responsibility, solidarity and ownership, offers a unique regional cooperation model in this sense, both in its way of functioning and in its principles.
As Turkey, we have embraced the Istanbul process at the highest level since its establishment, and we continue to do so. We have made great efforts to strengthen the process, increase its effectiveness and improve its ability to produce solutions to problems. This is the only platform that brings together all stakeholders related to Afghanistan in political, security, economic and commercial dimensions. During our co-chairmanship, which we assumed for the second time, we sought an answer to the question of how we can benefit from the Istanbul process in a more efficient and practical way. The declaration to be approved today is the fruit of these searches. I believe that we will increase the interest in the process with the commitments and decisions recorded in the declaration.
Dear Guests,
Afghanistan is going through a sensitive period, and as the international community, we need to increase the material and moral investments we have been making in Afghanistan for 18 years. As we always say, it's hard to build, it's easy to tear down. The successes achieved as a result of long and arduous efforts will soon be replaced by a great defeat if care is not taken and the necessary care is not taken. This is even more true for fragile countries such as Afghanistan. Neglecting Afghanistan by focusing on some of the gains made in recent years will cause irreparable damage. For this reason, it is important for all of us to increase the efforts of all countries that care about the peace, tranquility and stability of Afghanistan. We must continue to support Afghanistan in every field to the extent of our means in this critical period without getting caught up in the gravity, only in this way will terrorist organizations be prevented from finding a suitable environment to flourish in Afghanistan.
Currently, there is a very serious influx of refugees from Afghanistan to Greece and Europe, as you know, through Iran and Turkey. And just a short time ago, we had to return about 2,000 Afghans.
With all this, we know that no development move can achieve its goal without the involvement of the private sector. The private sector and regional projects will play a major role in the economic and social development of Afghanistan. We appreciate the steps taken in this direction.
As NATO allies, we reaffirmed our commitment to our continued contribution to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in London last week, and as of now, some 800 of our security personnel are in Afghanistan. We called on NATO countries to continue their support for Afghanistan. As Turkey, we continue to support both the capacity of the Afghan army and police and the economic, commercial and social development of Afghanistan. We are determined to continue this as long as our Afghan brothers and sisters demand it.
While the international community remains committed to its commitments to Afghanistan, it is important that the Afghan Government also fulfils its obligations. We welcome the positive steps being taken by the Afghan Government in implementing the mutual accountability framework agreed in Geneva last year.
It is seen that our Afghan brothers and sisters still have a long way to go for their own future, in terms of combating corruption, drugs, especially drug production and trafficking, strengthening the status of women, and education. Undoubtedly, multidimensional and chronic problems cannot be expected to be solved in a short time. The important thing here is to demonstrate the will to face the problems. Afghanistan has shown this will with the decisive steps it has taken recently. Our duty is to support efforts that will further strengthen this will.
On this occasion, I would like to express something that we are concerned about. Afghanistan is a country that has suffered a lot from fratricidal strife and paid a very heavy price. There is no winner in sibling strife except those who feed on chaos. We see that the ethnic fault lines in Afghan politics are becoming sharper, and we are concerned about this. Regardless of the outcome of the presidential election, we hope that the new government will adopt embracing, unifying and sincere approaches in the Afghan political scene.
The counting process, which is carried out in a fair and transparent manner, will be determined by the will of the Afghan people to win the presidential election, which is also carried out on the basis of these principles. Everyone is obliged to respect this result. As long as the legitimacy of the electoral process is not overshadowed at this point, otherwise it is inevitable that we will encounter a result such as the Afghan people losing their faith in democracy. I believe that the Afghan people and the Afghan State with all its institutions will not allow such a situation.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Afghan authorities for their support to our country in the fight against FETÃ, which martyred 251 of our citizens.
Turkish Maarif Foundation has taken over 12 high schools in Afghanistan in the last year. We are determined to continue the support we provide to Afghanistan's education sector through our foundation in the coming period.
Dear Guests,
The arrival and perpetuation of peace in Afghanistan is possible with the sincere and genuine support of all of us gathered around this table.Â  I believe that the Istanbul Process, the Heart of Asia, has also served a very useful and effective function in providing regional support for peace. If we compete among our Afghan friends in terms of dialogue and negotiations, we are destined to lose time and energy. The diversity in the number of initiatives aimed at providing regional support for peace in Afghanistan is remarkable. The main purpose is to prepare an environment that will open the door to meaningful dialogue and negotiation between all elements of the Afghan people, and it is essential that the process is carried out with this understanding. In order for our resources to be used correctly and effectively, we need sincere dialogue and coordination on this issue. I think that the Istanbul process is the right address to meet this need. It is also obvious that a lasting peace to be established in Afghanistan will add great strength to our common fight against terrorism.
As a country that is actively fighting hand-to-hand with DAESH and is at the forefront of this struggle, we are saddened to see the organization start to gain ground in Afghanistan again. The determination of the Afghan security forces in the fight against DAESH and the successes they have achieved in recent weeks are pleasing. The transmission of the DAESH virus to Afghanistan must be prevented. This terrorist organization has inflicted the greatest damage on the Islamic world and Muslims with the brutal murders it has committed in Syria and Iraq. Our geography has been turned into a bloodbath by this organization. In addition to the Afghan authorities, all actors in the region have important duties in the fight against DAESH. As a country that has sacrificed 304 of its citizens to DAESH terrorism, we will give our best support to eradicate this organization from Afghanistan. I believe that the same sensitivity will be exhibited by all our friends here.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank each of you on behalf of myself and my nation for your participation in the conference, and I invite all countries and international organizations to make the most of the Istanbul Process, the Heart of Asia, which is the widest participation and comprehensive platform on Afghanistan.
I also wish success to Tajikistan, which has taken over the next Presidency. I pray to my Lord that our meeting and the decisions we will take will be beneficial for Afghanistan and our Afghan brothers.
Be thankful, be present, be entrusted to God, stay healthy.

I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, affection and respect.
The land of the woods can be held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, at the 7th Session of the Turkic Council. I am very fortunate to be present on the occasion of the summit.
I would like to express my gratitude to my brother Ilham Aliyev, who hosted the Summit Meeting, for his hospitality. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my dear brother President Jeenbekov on his successful chairmanship of the Turkic Council last year.
10 of the Nakhchivan Agreement. This summit, which coincides with the anniversary and in which my dear brother Shavkat Mirziyoyev participated as a full member, is truly historic. I heartily welcome you to Uzbekistan.
Another point that makes this summit historic is the presentation of the title of Honorary President of the Turkic Council to the Aksakal of the Turkic world, the founding President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, my dear brother Elbashi Nazarbayev, upon my proposal, as a sign of our gratitude. I offer my appreciation and congratulations to your Excellency.
We are very pleased to see my dear friend Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, among us again this year.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Secretary General Mr. Baghdad Amreyev and his team for their devoted efforts.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
We see that the role of structures such as the Turkic Council in world politics is increasing. We attach importance to the Turkic Council's cooperation and coordination with other multilateral platforms. We want the Council to have observer status before the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In this respect, we support the proposal to establish a common fund for the Turkic world. However, first of all, the financial, legal and administrative foundations of this fund must be firmly laid. In this regard, we find it beneficial to carry out a comprehensive study under the coordination of the secretariat by consulting the experience of the relevant national and international institutions.
The dollar-indexed position of international trade brings risks in an environment of uncertainty. For this, we must put in place mechanisms that will reduce the foreign exchange pressure on our economies. I would like to underline again the importance we attach to trade in local currencies.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Transportation routes through the Caspian Sea and Turkey-connected transportation routes through the middle corridor on the east-west axis have a high potential. Our full use of this route depends on the development of cooperation between our customs.
Quotas are unfortunately one of the biggest obstacles to our trade. As the Turkic Council, we need to abolish the quotas between us. In addition, we should focus on projects for the joint action of our diasporas.
Currently, we offer university opportunities to approximately 300 students from Turkic Council member countries with Turkish scholarships. Praise be to our 10 thousands of students who graduated from Turkish universities. Today, as a doctor, engineer, bureaucrat and politician, he proudly serves the Turkic world. We should continue to increase our work in fields such as science, history, youth, sports, archives and librarianship, especially culture and education. In this regard, we should jointly support the Baku-based TURKPA, the Baku-based Turkic Culture and Heritage Foundation, the Turkic Academy in Astana and TURKSOY in Ankara. We expect to take the decision on the establishment of a coordination committee that will strengthen the liaison between these organizations at our summit.
Today, the biggest source of threat to the peace, tranquility and stability of our region is terrorist organizations. The existence of evil networks such as PKK, YPG, DAESH and FETO has increased the security of our cooperation in the field of security.
What we have experienced in Syria in the last 8 years has shown that one terrorist organization cannot be eliminated by another. As a country, we took a very important step on October 9 to liquidate the PKK and YPG terrorist organization. Our Operation Peace Spring has two important objectives. The first of these; It is the complete elimination of the terrorist threat originating from the PKK and YPG in northern Syria.
The second aim of the operation is to ensure that 3 million 650 thousand Syrian Arabs, whom we have hosted for 8 years, can return to their own country and homeland with a peaceful heart. Apart from this, we host around 350 thousand Syrian Kurds in our country.
Today we are on the 7th day of the operation. United Nations 74. Our operation continues successfully in accordance with the safe zone map we shared with the whole world at the General Assembly. As of this morning, we have liberated an area of about a thousand square kilometers from the occupation of the separatist terrorist organization. Hopefully, we will soon secure the region from Manbij to our border with Iraq and ensure that 1 million and then 2 million Syrian refugees return to their homes by choice. As in Afrin, Jarablus and Azaz, we will ensure stability here with infrastructure, schools, hospitals and housing projects with international support. We will continue our struggle until the north of Syria is green again with the springs of peace and we achieve our goals.
As our ancestor Dede Korkut said; ""A good friend is one who comes when he is called on a good day and uncalled on a bad day."" Yes, we expect very strong solidarity from you, my brothers and sisters, in Turkey's struggle for survival against terrorism. Once again, I would like to thank all the leaders who have supported Turkey since the beginning of the operation. I know very well that the hearts of each of my brothers and sisters in the Turkic world of 300 million people beat with us and pray for our country and our heroic army.
Likewise, we urge you to continue your support to our country in the fight against the FETÃ organization, which martyred 251 of our people and injured 2193 of our people on the night of July 15. We are ready to make any contribution we can through our Turkish Maarif Foundation.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
It is a requirement of our brotherhood to stand by each other in our national causes. The fact that Nagorno-Karabakh, the native land of Azerbaijan, and its surroundings are under the occupation of Armenia has forced one million of our brothers and sisters to live as fugitives away from their homes and homelands. As I said in my speech to the United Nations General Assembly, this is unacceptable. We will continue to exert our utmost efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict as soon as possible and on the basis of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.
The Turkish Cypriots, who are an essential part of the Turkish world, continue to be the pride of the deadlock. Our expectation is that you will help break the unjust isolation and embargo to which the Turkish Cypriots have been subjected.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to the Turkic Council to this day.
Hopefully, next year it will be held in Turkey 8. I believe that we will see Turkmenistan among us as a full member at our summit.
We hope that our meeting will be beneficial, I send my greetings and affection to all my brothers and sisters in the Turkic world through you, and with the participation of Turkmenistan, yes, we wish to be one nation with 6 states.
May God help us. Thank you.

Chairman of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Jelko KomÅ¡iÄ,
Distinguished Members of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Sefik Caferovic and Mr. Milorad Dodik,
Dear Investors,
Dear Members of the Press,
Distinguished Guests,
I greet you with love and respect on the occasion of this meaningful meeting. Today, we are witnessing a historic moment between our countries. We are proud to have completed 12 projects, all of which are more important than the other. At the beginning of 2018, we held the meeting that paved the way for the Belgrade-Sarajevo Motorway Project with my dear friend Vucic and Mr. Izetbegovic, a member of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, in Istanbul. Immediately after this meeting, we made great efforts to quickly implement the peace project in the Balkans.
I would like to thank my dear friend Vucic, my dear friend Komsic and the distinguished members of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina for their support to this project.
We see the bridge, which will be located on the Sava River and the foundation of which we have laid today, as a bridge of friendship and we attach a symbolic value. We have great expectations from our TaÅyapÄ± company to implement the project as soon as possible and properly. I believe that this Turkish company will complete this project in a shorter time than the specified time.
Dear Guests,
Our historical and cultural heritage is our common wealth. Every work in this land is a monument of our solidarity and cooperation. We will build our future together with the inspiration, strength and courage we have received from the past. The latest example of this is the Ram Castle, one of the pearls of the Danube River, whose restoration works have been completed by TIKA. I believe that this wonderful example of our cultural heritage will contribute to the tourism potential of the region, and I wish it to be beneficial.
Today, we will also hold the groundbreaking ceremony of the New Market-Tutin road. I would like to thank my friend Vucic and the relevant ministers for their support of this project, which will facilitate the transportation of the Sandzak region to other regions and increase economic and commercial dynamism.
Shortly after my visit in 2017, the esteemed Municipality Minister of Tutin, Åemsuddin Kuchevic, had the mercy of God as a result of a tragic traffic accident on the Yeni Pazar-Tutin road. On this occasion, I once again commemorate him with gratitude and wish God's mercy on my brother Shamsuddin Kuchevic, and my condolences to his loved ones, his family and all the people of Tutin.
Today, we are inaugurating the branch of the Justice Academy of the Supreme Court of Yeni Pazar, which was built and equipped by TIKA, and the Valide Sultan Mosque in Syenitsa, whose restoration was also completed by TIKA. I hope that our investments will be beneficial to all the people of the region.
Dear Friends,
Turkey will continue to increase its investments in Serbia as a whole. We have just watched, today we are officially opening the factories of Fleks Academy, Berteks Textile, SÃ¶ylemez Rubber, the opening of additional facilities of Teklas Automotive and Jiinci Tekstil, and the opening of the Yurtday Textile factory, which will be operational at full capacity in a short time. In addition, we are holding the groundbreaking ceremony of the FEKA Automotive factory today.
I wish all these investments to be beneficial to the region and the people of the region.
Turkey's only desire is peace and stability in the Balkans. In the last quarter century, these lands have suffered greatly, paid a very serious price. We should build our future together, not as an element of conflict, but by seeing our richness. We must improve our cooperation in all areas. Hopefully, I believe that we will add new ones to these projects, which are our common pride, in the coming period.
I would like to thank my dear friend Vucic again for hosting. I believe that we will build the future of the region in a much stronger way with all our valuable friends.
I thank you and convey Turkey's greetings and love to you.

Turkey-Serbia-Bosnia and Herzegovina Trilateral Summit,2019-10-08,"

Mr. President, my dear friend Vucic,
Dear Bosnia and Herzegovina Chairman-in-Office and Chairman-in-Office,
Dear Members of the Press,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings. We have completed the Turkey-Serbia-Bosnia and Herzegovina Summit Meeting held today. And after the fruitful meetings we held yesterday on the relations between Serbia and Turkey, we are happy that today's Trilateral Summit has been fruitful. We will hold our next summit in May, then in Turkey, first in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then in Turkey. And the fact that this will continue decisively will lead to very, very productive developments in the fusion of our peoples, both in terms of Turkey, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of course, the most important aspect of today's summit is, first; It has been a year since the government problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in the region, was resolved quickly. Because in a country where there is no government, it is not possible to achieve a productive future, it is necessary to achieve this.
Another issue, especially at the point of transportation, as the leaders have stated, I believe that the steps to be taken on highways will lead to very, very important developments and development between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because I always have a statement, the road is life, the road is civilization. If you do this, the construction of this highway between Belgrade and Sarajevo will also make the settlement and settlement in the whole region tuberculosis and prevent migration from here. On the contrary, with the construction of these, this place will become an area of attraction and it will not be possible for the people living here to leave their own lands.
In this regard, I would like to thank my dear friend Vucic for hosting this summit and hope that this summit will be beneficial in the next summit meetings.
Thank you.

Dear participants,
Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, we have based our policies at the local and international level on the principle that no one is left behind. Only in this way can we achieve the goals of eliminating poverty, hunger and inequality and providing education and health services to all. We must take into account the needs of vulnerable populations, such as the least developed countries and refugees. At the root of many of the problems in our world today is not a lack of material means, but a lack of compassion and empathy.
Today, Turkey is the country hosting the largest number of refugees in the world. We have spent 40 billion dollars for the refugees who have taken refuge in our country and 3.6 million of whom are still living within our borders. We continue our diplomatic efforts to maintain calm in Idlib, which was on the verge of a humanitarian crisis last year and is home to four million civilians. We are rebuilding schools, hospitals, infrastructure and superstructure facilities in the areas that we have cleared of terrorism in Syria. Now we are preparing to clear the east of the Euphrates from terrorist organizations for the same purpose.
We aim to raise both the Syrians in our country and our brothers and sisters residing in the region we have made safe as individuals who will contribute to the reconstruction of Syria when lasting peace is achieved. We expect you to support these efforts carried out by Turkey on behalf of all humanity.
Dear Friends,
The need to maintain regular migration is evident in terms of maintaining the global labor market. Everyone should benefit from the radical changes that technological progress has brought about in the education, health, finance and agriculture sectors. The United Nations Technology Bank, hosted by our country, is the first sustainable development goal ever implemented. In addition to the ten million dollars it has committed to the bank so far, our country has decided to make an additional voluntary contribution of one million dollars. This effort should be more embraced and supported by the international community.
On the other hand, with the adoption of the 2030 agenda, the need to develop public-private partnerships has increased. Over the next decade, diversification of partnerships with the private sector should be prioritized. We are home to the United Nations Development Programme Global Center for the Private Sector in Istanbul. Our country is ready to share its experience in the field of public-private partnership with everyone.
Together with the United Nations Development Program, we have implemented the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Accelerator Project. This project aims to provide support by the public and private sectors to innovative efforts to ensure that no one, especially refugees, is left behind.
Turkey will continue to take entrepreneurial, inclusive and decisive steps in the next 10 years to implement the 2030 agenda.
Thank you very much.

United Nations 74. Their Speech at the General Assembly,2019-09-24,"

Mr. President,
Dear Heads of State and Government,
Dear Secretary General,
Dear Delegates,
I salute you with respect on behalf of myself and my nation. I would like to thank Mr. Espinosa for the successful work he has carried out over the past year. I also wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Muhammad Bande on taking over the Presidency of the General Assembly. I hope that the General Assembly Meeting will be beneficial for the world and humanity.
Dear Delegates,
Today, our world is faced with many problems and pains caused by injustice at the global level. Hazrat Rumi, the great scholar of our civilization, expresses justice as giving everyone their due by distributing rights and duties as necessary. In our world today, it is obvious that neither rights nor responsibilities are properly shared. Injustice, on the other hand, brings instability, power struggles, crises and waste. However, the institution we are in now was established after the Second World War to eliminate this injustice. However, today, the international community is gradually losing its ability to produce permanent solutions to problems such as terrorism, hunger, misery and climate change that threaten its future.
Of course, it is appropriate that the theme of this year's General Assembly is to eradicate poverty, quality education, combat climate change, and reinvigorate multilateral efforts for inclusion. But what really matters is what we can do together. It is unacceptable that while one side of the world lives in high prosperity and luxury, hunger, misery and ignorance are rampant on the other side. While a lucky minority of the world is discussing digital technology, robots, artificial intelligence and obesity, it is very sad that more than two billion people live below the poverty line and nearly a billion people live below the hunger line. We cannot turn our backs on the fact that none of us will be safe if each of us is not safe.
From this podium, I have been saying for years that the fate of humanity cannot be left to the elders of a limited number of countries. I repeat here in your presence, 'the world is bigger than five'.
It is high time to change our mentality, our institutions and our rules. The injustice between the countries that have nuclear power and the countries that do not have it is enough to upset the balance of the world. It is significant that those who possess nuclear weapons are particularly threatening those who do not have nuclear weapons. Like everyone else, we are disturbed by the fact that weapons of mass destruction based on nuclear power are presented as a trump card in every crisis, instead of being completely destroyed. This power must either be forbidden to everyone or free for all. Let's solve this problem on the basis of justice as soon as possible for the peaceful future of all humanity.
At a time when 13 people die every minute from air pollution and global warming threatens the future of our world, none of us can remain ignorant of these problems. First, we must strengthen the potential and effectiveness of the United Nations. We must immediately carry out fundamental reforms in accordance with justice and equity, especially in the Security Council.
Turkey is a country that strives to find fair solutions to problems that embrace the whole world and humanity with its entrepreneurial and humanitarian foreign policy approach. It is not for nothing that we are the country that provides the most generous humanitarian aid in the world and the state that accepts the most people who have acquired it from their places. We will exhibit another concrete example of this policy with the African Union-Turkey Partnership Summit, the third of which will be held in our country in 2020.
I continue to support all the countries in this hall to our policies and initiatives that we have built on the principles of justice, morality and conscience.
Dear Delegates,
Today, Syria is a geography that wounds the conscience of humanity and has become a symbol of global injustice. The crisis that has been taking place in this country since 2011 has been persistently tried to be maintained by the regime and terrorist organizations and the forces that encourage it. It is time to end the Syrian crisis, which has killed nearly one million people, displaced more than 12 million people, and forced half of them to live outside the country.
Turkey is the country that suffers the most from the threat of DAESH. On the one hand, this organization harassed our borders, on the other hand, it directly attacked our hearts with the suicide bombings it carried out in various cities and in which hundreds of our citizens lost their lives. Turkey is the country that struck the first and most serious blow against DAESH in Syria. With Operation Euphrates Shield, we neutralized approximately 3,500 Daesh members and started the process of the organization's collapse in Syria. We are also at the forefront of identifying, banning and deporting terrorists from all over the world who take action to join DAESH.
On the other hand, today Turkey is the country that provides the most humanitarian aid in the world compared to its national income. We are hosting five million refugees fleeing conflict, hunger and persecution. In other words, there are more asylum seekers in Turkey than the population of each of the 29 states in the United States combined. 3 million 650 thousand of the refugees in our country are from our neighbor Syria, which means that we are currently hosting half of the population of New York City in our lands. In the last eight years, we have spent $40 billion on refugees. So, is there anything coming to Turkey? Let me tell you that; The support that has come to us from the European Union so far, this is not our national budget, but only through international organizations, this support comes to AFAD and our Red Crescent, which is three billion euros as of now.
365,000 of the asylum seekers who came to our country returned to the regions we made safe in Syria. Where? To Jarablus. Nearly half of the Syrian refugees are under the age of 18, and the number of Syrian children born in our country has approached 500 thousand. We provide them with all kinds of opportunities, not only housing, but also education and health. On the other hand, the world has unfortunately forgotten the millions of oppressed people whose journeys to save their lives ended either in the dark waters of the Mediterranean or in front of the fences stretched on the borders. Especially as you can see at work, the world forgot about baby Aylan very quickly. Do not forget that one day the same situation may happen to you. Because Aylan babies are not one, but thousands, millions, we have to take our precautions against all these.
In the first eight months of this year alone, we saved 32,000 irregular migrants from drowning at sea. Again, in the first eight months of this year, we sent 58,000 irregular migrants back to their countries, except for Syrians. Despite this, together with those coming from other regions, Turkey is today a country that hosts five million oppressed people in its territory. Unfortunately, we were left alone in these self-sacrificing efforts for refugees. There has been no return to the areas under the control of the regime, the PKK-YPG or DAESH in Syria, and the only place where those who fled this country have returned is in the areas that Turkey has made safe.
Today, there are 3 important issues that we need to pay attention to in the solution of the humanitarian crisis in Syria.
First; It is the effective and efficient operation of the constitutional committee, which we see as a critical process for the establishment of Syria's territorial integrity and political unity. At the beginning of last week, together with Russia and Iran, we achieved a very important success with the decision we took at the Ankara Summit on this issue. When a permanent political solution is reached in Syria, the territorial integrity of this country will be automatically restored.
The second important issue; It is to prevent possible massacres in Idlib and a potential migration wave of approximately 4 million people. The agreement we reached with Russia in Sochi on this issue is still valid despite some setbacks. Turkey has neither the patience nor the means to welcome another wave of immigration. For this reason, we expect all countries to support Turkey's efforts to ensure security and stability in Idlib.
The third important issue is the elimination of the PKK-YPG terrorist structure in the east of the Euphrates, which occupies a quarter of Syria and is tried to be legitimized under the name of the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces. We cannot find a permanent solution to the Syrian issue without establishing an understanding that looks at all terrorist organizations from the same distance.
We are negotiating with the United States on the creation of a safe zone there. Our intention is to establish a peace corridor 30 kilometers deep and 480 kilometers long in the first stage and to ensure the settlement of 2 million Syrians there. This is our boundary, and this is the region below in depth. When this safe zone is declared, we have the chance to easily settle between 1 million and 2 million immigrants and refugees in this safe zone. Here, both the United States and the coalition forces, Russia and Iran, all work together to take these refugees out of the tent cities, out of the container cities and settle them here in this safe zone. We need to take the steps of this together, Turkey cannot handle this alone.
We need to take a step at this point today. If we can reduce the depth of this region to the Deir ez-Zor-Raqqa line, we can increase the number of Syrians who will return to their lands from our country, Europe and other parts of the world up to three million.
As Turkey, we have started to make the necessary preparations in this regard, which we are determined to realize. Under the leadership of our country, we are planning an international conference within this framework with the participation of Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. We also attach importance to the success of the Global Refugee Forum, which will be held in Geneva in December and which we will co-chair. We also think that a United Nations-led donors' conference could be organized to support the return to safe areas.
There is also a need to effectively operate the global compact on migration and the global compact on refugees, which was adopted at the United Nations last year.
The stability and security environment that we will provide in Syria in accordance with the right, law and conscience will also relieve our neighbor Iraq in terms of both DAESH and PKK threats.
From the hall of the United Nations General Assembly, I call on the whole world to take the initiative and support our efforts to stop this humanitarian crisis in Syria.
Dear Delegates,
In addition to the migrant tragedies triggered by the Syrian crisis, the Mediterranean Basin is also facing other problems due to the developments in the Eastern Mediterranean. Despite the negotiations that have been going on for more than 50 years, the Cyprus issue has not been resolved due to the intransigent attitude of the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriot side is pursuing an unjust and unjust policy of imposition, refusing to share political power and prosperity with the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey is the guarantor of the Turkish Cypriot people, with whom it has deep historical and cultural ties, based on international agreements, in the same way it is the guarantor of Greece, in the same way it is the guarantor of the UK. It is obvious that those who claim that the problem in Cyprus will be solved with zero security and zero guarantee conditions have bad intentions from the very beginning. As Turkey, we will continue to strive until a solution is found that guarantees the security and rights of the Turkish Cypriot people.
On the other hand, we see the energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean as an important business opportunity with a win-win approach. On the other hand, some countries in the region are trying to turn energy resources into problems and conflict areas with unilateral steps despite our reasonable attitude. We will protect the legitimate rights and interests of both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot people in the Eastern Mediterranean until the end. Our door will continue to be open to all kinds of proposals based on cooperation and fair sharing.
In Libya, another critical region of the Mediterranean, we are striving to ensure security and stability in the country through the establishment of a democratic administration based on the free will of the people.
The political and economic strengthening of Libya will relieve both North Africa and Europe. We believe that the solution in this country is to respect the choices of the Libyan people.
The interventions in Yemen and Qatar have had severe consequences both humanly and economically. It is everyone's aspiration that the crisis in the region, which has flared up again due to attacks on oil production facilities, should be resolved as soon as possible.
I would like to express that we will follow this incident, which is taking place in our country, especially since the court and the judiciary have not concluded this process, as the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was brutally murdered last year, has not concluded this process.
And here, of course, another situation, especially the death of the elected President of Egypt, especially in the courtroom, yes, in a struggle, and as a result, the burial of his family is not even allowed, which is a bleeding wound in our hearts. It has become a symbol of the region's deep need for justice and equity.
We hope that the discussions about Iran's activities and the threats against this country will be resolved on a rational basis as soon as possible.
Dear Delegates,
One of the places where injustice is most common in our world today is the Palestinian territories under Israeli occupation. If even the images of the despicable murder of an innocent Palestinian woman on the street by the Israeli security forces just a few days ago fail to stir consciences, then we are at the end of the line.
I wonder, where is this Israel? Where does this Israeli territory cover? Where was Israel in 1947, then where was Israel in 1949, 1967, and where is Israel now? Look, it's 1947, it's almost like there's no Israel here, it's all Palestine. The year is 1947, there is a partition plan, and Palestine is shrinking and Israel is growing.
I come to 1967 with 1949, and here is Israel, and Palestine is shrinking. And I come to this day, the current situation is this: There is almost no Palestine anymore, almost all of it is Israel. Is Israel getting enough? No, he can't get enough. Israel is now trying to take the rest. So, there are all these resolutions taken by the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations with Israel, are these decisions being implemented? No, it doesn't. So, what does the United Nations do? So, if we cannot influence the decision we make under this roof, where will justice be served? Here's our problem.
In addition to these murders, the current Israeli administration is trampling on all the values of humanity beyond international law with its actions such as the inhumane blockade of Gaza, illegal settlement activities, and attacks on the historical and legal status of Jerusalem. As Turkey, our stance on this issue is clear, solution; It is the immediate establishment of a Palestinian State with independent and independent territories with East Jerusalem as its capital on the basis of the 1967 borders. Any other peace plan has no chance of being fair, accepted and implemented.
From the podium of the United Nations, I ask, what are the borders of the State of Israel, are they the borders of 1948, the borders of 1967, or does it have some other border? If the settlements in the Golan Heights and the West Bank, like the other occupied Palestinian territories, are not within the borders of this state, how can they be usurped before the eyes of the world?
Is the aim of the initiative, which is presented as the Deal of the Century, to completely eliminate the existence of the State of Palestine and its people? Do they want to drown the world in blood?
All actors of the international community, especially the United Nations, should provide concrete support to the Palestinian people beyond promises. In this regard, it is very important that the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East continues effectively.
Turkey will continue to stand by the oppressed Palestinian people, as it has done so far.
Another issue for the just and peaceful future of our world is to remove the South Caucasus from being one of the problematic regions of the world. It is unacceptable that Nagorno-Karabakh, which is the territory of Azerbaijan, and its surroundings are still under occupation despite the decisions taken.
One of the problems that the international community still does not pay enough attention to is the Kashmir conflict, which has not been resolved for 72 years. The stability and prosperity of South Asia cannot be separated from the Kashmir issue. Currently, despite the decision of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations, Kashmir is under siege and eight million people cannot leave Kashmir. In order for Kashmiris to look to a secure future together with their Pakistani and Indian neighbours, it is imperative that the problem here is resolved through dialogue on the basis of justice and equity, not conflict.
One of the issues that the world remains ignorant of is the human tragedy faced by the Muslim Rohingya. The Independent Commission of Inquiry established within the United Nations has recorded that there is an intention to commit genocide behind the events in Myanmar's Arakan state. Turkey has continued its initiatives to ensure the security and fundamental rights of the Rohingya since the first day and will continue its humanitarian aid activities.
The occupations, conflicts and terrorist activities that have been going on in Afghanistan for nearly 40 years have caused problems at the global level. It is time for this ancient geography to regain peace and security. As the international community, we must all assume responsibility and strive in this regard.
Dear Delegates,
Today, one of the biggest threats to global peace and tranquility is the rise in racist, xenophobic, discriminatory and anti-Islamic tendencies. Muslims rank first among those who are subjected to hate speech, insults to their sacred values and discrimination. The terrorist attack that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand last March is the most striking example of this.
Just as the terrorist attack targeting Muslims in New Zealand is wrong, the terrorist attacks targeting Christians in Sri Lanka or Jews in America are just as wrong. There are many responsible for the transformation of this disease into a madness. At the forefront of those responsible are populist politicians who try to win votes by provoking such tendencies, and circles that normalize hate speech under the pretext of freedom of expression. Anyone who approaches immigrants, especially Muslims, with ignorance and prejudice and marginalizes them contributes to the rise of these sick trends. This scourge can only be eradicated by our common will and efforts.
It is the most important duty of us statesmen to express our reaction with an inclusive discourse and concrete measures based on tolerance. In this context, the Secretary General recently announced the action plan for the protection of religious sites prepared by the Alliance of Civilizations, which we pioneered. I hope that the plan will help raise awareness on this issue.
From here, I call for the United Nations to declare March 15, the day of the Christchurch attack, as an international day of solidarity against Islamophobia.
I invite the Islamic world to take a deep account of the issues that form the basis of its internal conflicts, especially the Sunni-Shiite divide, and which are mainly used as a tool for political conflicts of interest.
Dear Delegates,
Our country, as a geography located in the center of the ancient world, is the heir to the human accumulation of both the East and the West. Therefore, we have to closely follow the developments in both worlds, take responsibility and take initiative.
As a country that is directly or indirectly affected by all of the crisis topics, some of which I can only express here today, we will continue to fulfill our responsibilities towards humanity.
A United Nations and especially the Security Council, which will be restructured on the basis of justice, morality and conscience, will give hope to humanity again. As Turkey, we are ready to support and contribute to every step to be taken in this regard. With this understanding, 75. We aspire to the post of President of the General Assembly. We have nominated Ambassador Volkan BozkÄ±r, former Minister for EU Affairs and current Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, for this important post. I have full confidence that Mr. BozkÄ±r, an experienced diplomat and politician, will successfully carry out this responsibility. I believe that you will not withhold your support for him.
We want to make our largest city, Istanbul, which currently hosts the regional administrations of various agencies of the United Nations, a much more comprehensive United Nations center.
The United Nations Technology Bank for the least developed countries launched near Istanbul last year.
We are also pleased with the positive and encouraging approach we have taken to our proposal to establish a United Nations Youth Center in Istanbul, which I brought to the agenda from this podium last year.
The number of members of the United Nations Group of Friends on Mediation, of which we are the co-chairman, has reached 59. After the United Nations, we carried this initiative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. I believe that it is possible for us to find just, equitable and conscientious solutions to every global issue we face.
I conclude my remarks with the following wishes: Freedom for all, peace for all, prosperity for all, justice for all, a peaceful and secure future for all.
I wish the 74th General Assembly to be successful, and I salute you all with respect on behalf of myself and my nation.

Speech at the event organized by the Turkish-American National Steering Committee (TASC),2019-09-23,
Speech at the UN Climate Action Summit,2019-09-23,"

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Gentlemen
I greet you with love and respect. Everything on earth that has been made available to man is a trust given to us. We have to protect it in the best way until we hand it over to the next owner.
Climate change is a global problem that knows no borders. In solving global problems, it is essential to establish cooperation at both regional and international levels.
The Secretary-General called on all countries to take responsibility for the fight against climate change. Upon this invitation, Turkey is co-chairing the Working Group on Infrastructure, Cities and Local Action together with Kenya and the United Nations Habitat. This working group constitutes a critical area in the fight against climate change, the concrete effects of which we will see in daily life. Turkey is aware that in order to successfully combat climate change, action must first be taken at the local level.
I served as the Mayor of the Metropolitan Municipality for 4.5 years in Istanbul, one of the most populous metropolises in the world. For the last 17 years, I have served my country as Prime Minister and President. Together with Istanbul, we have expanded the use of natural gas instead of solid fuels in all of our 81 provinces. Today, Turkey is the leading country in its region in renewable energy. Currently, we get more than 30 percent of our electricity from renewable energy. We will increase the share of renewable energy in electricity generation to approximately 39 percent in 2023. While building climate-sensitive, energy-efficient cities, we also reduce disaster risks. With our public gardens project, we aim to rapidly increase our green areas and therefore our sink capacity. We are one of the rare countries that have increased the presence of forests. In the last 17 years, we have planted more than 4 billion saplings. On November 11, we plant another 11 million saplings. One of our goals for 2023 is to increase our forest areas to 30 percent of the total area.
In addition, we are building new metro lines to alleviate the traffic problem in our cities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We aim to increase the share of railways in total freight transportation from around five percent to 10 percent, and its share in passenger transportation from one percent to four percent. We will carry our high-speed train lines to approximately 5600 kilometers in the next five years, and we will increase our urban rail system length by around 50 percent.
We have implemented historical projects such as Marmaray and Eurasia Tunnel.
We have made significant progress in waste management, the use of climate-friendly technology and energy resources, and the improvement of air, water and soil quality throughout our country.
With a regulation we have put into practice, we have reduced the use of plastic bags in our country by three-quarters.
The zero waste project, which was initiated under the leadership of my wife, was quickly adopted in all our cities and institutions. We are expanding our zero waste project to the whole of Turkey. By 2023, we will have switched to a zero waste system in approximately 400 thousand buildings. We will increase the rate of recovery from waste from 13 to 35 percent.
Bicycle paths are also one of our most important investment areas in the recent period. In 2023, we will increase the bicycle paths from a thousand kilometers to four thousand kilometers. We implement policies for adaptation to climate change and resilience against disasters without giving up our development goals.
In order to combat climate change at the local level, we prepare separate action plans for each of our geographical regions. We have published our action plan for the Black Sea region, and we will publish it for our other regions in a short time.
Here, I would like to present to you the initiatives of our working group.
The first initiative is the leadership initiative for local climate investment. The second is the zero-carbon buildings for all initiative. This important initiative has two key components. The first is the preparation of roadmaps for making new buildings carbon neutral by 2030 and existing buildings by 2050. Second; It is the realization of an investment of approximately one trillion dollars on a global scale by 2030.
With our third initiative, the climate-friendly transportation initiative, we aim to create sustainable urban transportation systems.
I wish these initiatives to be beneficial and invite all countries to take responsibility within their means and on the basis of equity.
I believe that the initiatives developed by the working group we co-chair will be supported by everyone.
Thank you very much.

President of Iran, Mr. Rouhani,
Mr. Putin, President of the Russian Federation,
Dear Members of the Committee,
Dear Members of the Press,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and respect. I am very pleased to welcome you to Ankara for the fifth of our summit meetings, welcome to Turkey.
I pray to my Lord that our meeting will be beneficial for our countries, our region and our Syrian brothers.
The trilateral summit process in the Astana format, which we started in November 2017, has achieved significant successes so far. On the occasion of the summit meetings, we have deepened our cooperation as three countries in the last two years in order to restore peace, security and stability in Syria. We are in full agreement on the preservation of Syria's political unity and territorial integrity, the preservation of calm on the ground, and the finding of a lasting political solution to the conflict.
The Astana platform is the only initiative that can produce effective solutions to extinguish the fire in Syria and take concrete steps to implement them. We are in a period where we need to assume more responsibility and take more responsibility for the establishment of peace in Syria. Keeping the hopes of a political solution alive depends on our efforts. I believe that the Ankara Summit will breathe new life into the Astana process.
In today's meeting, we will discuss the situation on the ground, especially in Idlib, the developments in the east of the Euphrates, the stage reached in the political process and the issue of Syrian refugees. I believe that it will be useful to make a general situation accounting on these issues in determining our strategies and the steps we will take.
Our country has stood by the Syrian people in their most troubled and difficult times. We are still hosting more than 3.6 million Syrians who fled persecution, terror and massacre on our soil. From education to health, we have spared no sacrifice to ensure that Syrian refugees continue their lives in humane conditions. With the Olive Branch and Euphrates Shield operations, we have dealt heavy blows to terrorist networks that threaten both the territorial integrity of Syria and the security of our country. The number of our Syrian brothers and sisters who have returned to places we have made safe, such as Jarablus, al-Bab and Afrin, has reached 360 thousand. With the joint steps we have taken in Idlib, we have prevented a great tragedy that would have turned the lives of 4 million civilians upside down. By draining the swamp of terrorism in the east of the Euphrates, we will hopefully carry our efforts in this direction to a new stage together. Because the terrorist attack targeting the hospital in Ãobanbey yesterday once again showed the brutal face of the separatist organization.
Dear Friends, I would like to give the floor to Mr. Rouhani and I would like to continue the opening part in this way.

Dear Metropolitan,
Dear members of the Syriac Orthodox Community,
Dear guests,
I greet you with love and respect. Of course, I would like to take this opportunity to salute all religious leaders for honoring this groundbreaking ceremony.
I would like to congratulate those who contributed to bringing the Mor Efrem Syriac Ancient Orthodox Church, the foundation of which we are together to lay today, to the Syriac Community and Istanbul.
It is the duty of the Republic of Turkey to ensure that the worship needs of the Assyrian community, which are the ancient sons of our geography, are met, like all other issues. With this understanding, about 10 years ago, at the request of Mr. Mor Filiksinos Yusuf Ãetin, we started the process regarding the church, where we are currently at the groundbreaking ceremony. With the completion of the historical features and other procedures of the place chosen for the church, the actual construction phase has finally been reached.
Our Istanbul Metropolitan Mayors Kadir TopbaÅ and MevlÃ¼t Uysal provided all kinds of support to our Foundation throughout the whole process.
With the Vatican representatives taking the necessary steps, our Assyrian citizens had the opportunity to have a church of their own here. I see this church, which I believe will be completed in a short time with the generous contributions of the Syriac Community, as a new wealth in Istanbul.
I just talked about it with Mr. Yusuf and asked him how soon it would be finished. They told me that we would finish it in 1.5-2 years at the latest. I added a little more, I said, you have to finish this place within 2 years at the latest, they said we will finish it in 2 years. I wish you good luck in advance. I hope we will be together at the opening.
Dear guests,
We are a nation that has ruled this geography for nearly a thousand years and Istanbul for 566 years. Throughout this long history, our geography has always been the center of religious, ethnic, cultural diversity, multicoloredness, and most importantly, the conscience of humanity. From Spain to the Caucasus, from Eastern Europe to North Africa, our doors and hearts have been wide open for all the oppressed and all the victims who have come to these lands.
Finally, we are hosting nearly 4 million people from Syria and Iraq, including Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens and our Muslim brothers, as well as Assyrians, Yazidis and people belonging to other faith groups.
While terrorist organizations commit all kinds of atrocities against these people in Iraq and Syria, and harm their lives and property, we have opened our hearts to everyone without any discrimination.
As in every period of history, it has never crossed our minds to question the beliefs, origins, colors or cultures of the people who come to our doorstep today. Because for us, everyone who comes here is human first. In this capacity alone, he is worthy of all kinds of respect, all kinds of support, all kinds of services in our eyes.
We have never discriminated against any kind of discrimination in the services we provide to our own citizens. Undoubtedly, Assyrians, one of the most ancient peoples of our geography, have as much right to access these services as anyone else.
Although the suffering experienced in our region for the last 150 years has caused many troubles and destruction, we have not allowed the slightest shake in our will to live together.
Everyone who has love, loyalty and contribution to Turkey is a first-class citizen of our country in our eyes. Neither in politics, nor in business, nor in other spheres, are there any hidden or explicit barriers for anyone. As a matter of fact, today, we see that people from all walks of life take part in the politics, business, art and sports life of our country to the extent of their own knowledge, effort and skills.
In our own personal lives, we have personally witnessed, experienced, benefited from and supported this multi-coloredness since our childhood. By strengthening our democracy, we have carried out activities that expand the areas of freedom and guarantee the rights of communities belonging to different religions together with everyone in our country.
At the point we have reached today, we are all witnessing how wrong those who claim that the development of democracy and the steps taken in this direction will harm our country are wrong. In our opinion, Turkey today has a much stronger social structure than in the past. As the President of Turkey, we will continue to work with the same approach in the coming period.
Dear friends,
The geography we live in, thanks to the natural and human wealth we have, has been the scene of the greatest civilization and culture-building movements of humanity for thousands of years. Such a central geography has inevitably been exposed to constant attacks and the suffering caused by them.
Our country is still experiencing a historical fate today. In the background of a significant part of the events taking place in our region, there is an ambition to own the riches of these lands. Although they have emerged with different discourses, the main target of all terrorist organizations and the forces that use them as tools is our common homeland.
The way to foil these attacks is to see our differences as our most important wealth and to act as 82 million with one heart and one wrist.
Do not forget that this country is the country of all of us, this state is the state of all of us. As Turkey becomes stronger, all of our citizens have benefited from the opportunities that have emerged and will benefit from them. As rights and freedoms expand in our country, all our citizens will benefit from this without exception.
Our only exception is terrorist organizations, terrorists. They are those who commit treason against their country and nation. Apart from this, there has never been and will never be a place for discrimination in our minds or hearts. Because the understanding of loving the created because of the Creator is a requirement of our civilization.
The closer we get to the goal of a great and powerful Turkey, the safer and more peaceful we will all feel. We will all share in the resulting prosperity.
The richness and fertility of this land, on which we will live together for thousands of years with the permission of Allah, is enough for all of us. The important thing is that we protect our unity, solidarity, solidarity and determination to unite around common goals. When we achieve this, I hope there is no problem that we cannot overcome.
In fact, on such a meaningful summer day, I would like to congratulate those who contributed to bringing the Mor Efrem Syriac Ancient Orthodox Church to the Syriac Community and Istanbul with these feelings at this groundbreaking ceremony.
Of course, I especially congratulate all the members of the congregation who will contribute here, or all our friends from outside the congregation.
I offer you my love and respect, with good health.

Conference on Cooperation and Confidence Building Measures in Asia 5. Their Speech at the Summit,2019-06-15,"

Dear Friend, Mr. President,
Dear Heads of State and Government,
Honourable Ministers, I greet you with my heartfelt feelings on behalf of myself, my country and my nation.
I am very pleased to be in Dushanbe on the occasion of the 5th Summit of the Conference on Cooperation and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.
My dear brother, I congratulate the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Rahman, on his successful Presidency. I would like to thank them for their hospitality. I hope that our meeting will be beneficial for our region.
We are holding the summit at a critical time in the context of regional and global events.
The foundations of the Conference on Cooperation and Confidence Building Measures in Asia were laid with the visionary proposal of our Aksakal Nur Sultan Nazarbayev.
As a result of our joint efforts, our conference has turned into a regional forum with a high level of representation, and the increase in the number of our members is proof of this. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Sri Lanka as the 27th member.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of Sri Lanka for the heinous terrorist act that took place two months ago and express our solidarity.
We are delighted to have Lagos join us as an observer.
As Turkey, we believe that our cooperation should be deepened first. In this respect, we think that work can be done to institutionalize conference structures and to disseminate their work. We need to take more ownership of the conference together. In addition to providing financial support, concrete contribution and active participation in the implementation of confidence-building measures will increase ownership. We can accelerate our work in these areas by setting some concrete targets based on the calendar.
Dear friends,
Unfortunately, in today's world, there is not order, but disorder. We are fighting conflicts, civil wars, proxy wars and terrorism in our immediate geography. The Conference on Cooperation and Confidence Building Measures in Asia is a platform where we can take joint steps in the face of all these challenges.
As Turkey, we strive to shape the dynamics around us in the direction of peace, prosperity and stability.
We are doing our best to end the civil war and ensure stability in our neighbor Syria. We are currently hosting nearly 4 million Syrians in our country. We have dealt very heavy blows with our cross-border operations against DAESH and PKK and YPG terrorist organizations that threaten the future of Syria. We have liberated more than 4 thousand square kilometers of territory from the occupation of terrorist organizations. We have enabled 330,000 Syrian refugees to return to their own lands, to their homeland.
We also take an active stance on the Palestinian issue, which is another bleeding wound of our region. It is a requirement of human dignity that occupation, oppression and injustice are no longer the fate of Palestine. We reject any attempt to create new fait accomplis in Jerusalem. We call on all countries to respect the resolutions of the United Nations and the historical and legal status of Jerusalem.
We support efforts to establish peace and end violence in Afghanistan. We will continue our activities within the scope of the Istanbul process, the heart of Asia, in this context.
We support the resolution of the Kashmir issue through dialogue between Pakistan and India and in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri People on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions.
We are also closely following the situation of the Rohingya and hope that this humanitarian tragedy will come to an end as soon as possible.
We currently co-chair mediation groups within the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. We also find it beneficial to improve the mediation capacity within our conference.
Dear friends,
Violent extremism and terrorism are on the rise around the world. We are a country that has been fighting terrorism for 35 years and has become the target of different terrorist organizations from DAESH to PKK, from FETÃ to Al-Qaeda. To date, we have sacrificed tens of thousands of our citizens in terrorist acts.
I would like to underline that there is no justification for terror and violence. It is very important to take a decisive and clear stance in this area. The destination of the policies of destroying another by one terrorist organization is more blood, more occupation, more cruelty and more tears. Unfortunately, the Syrian field has been proof of this bitter truth.
On the other hand, concrete steps need to be taken to secure the foundations of stable and sustainable development. In this context, we believe in the benefit of multilateral solutions based on equity.
We attach importance to the development of combined transport corridors in our region, support the reconstruction of the modern Silk Road. Our Trans-Caspian East-West joint corridor initiative, which crosses the Caucasus and Central Asia and reaches China, is the most concrete example of this approach.
I would like to express that we do not find unilateral steps and sanctions that harm regional peace, stability and economic cooperation correct.
With these thoughts in mind, I hope that the Dushanbe Summit will be a turning point in the long-term solidarity between us.
I offer you my deepest love and respect.

Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2019-06-12,
Their Speech at the Great ÃskÃ¼dar Iftar,2019-05-31,"

Dear Istanbulites,
Dear Fellow Citizens of ÃskÃ¼dar,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Gentlemen
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to congratulate your Ramadan, which we are now approaching its last days, our Night of Power, which we will realize tonight, and our Eid al-Fitr, which we will celebrate on Tuesday.
I pray that the fasts we keep, the prayers we perform, and the good deeds we do will be accepted in the sight of Allah. I ask Allah to bring peace, well-being and blessings to you, our nation and the entire Islamic world in honor of these blessed days.
I would like to thank the Mayor of ÃskÃ¼dar and his team for bringing us together on this beautiful Istanbul evening, on this blessed night.
Hopefully, we will go to our Esenler district from here a little later, and we will participate in the Night of Power program, which will be held in DÃ¶rtyol Square, accompanied by 10 thousand hatim and 100 thousand prayers.
I believe that the hands that are opened to the sky tonight from Istanbul to all over our country and the world will not be turned away empty-handed. The most acceptable prayer is the prayer made by a Muslim to a Muslim. Based on this fact, we will revive our night with prayers that will encompass our entire nation and all Muslims, starting with our own family, from the people to the people. May God bless you all.
May Allah bring us many more Ramadan's and many more holidays with the taste of our mouths. May Allah give us the strength, strength and opportunity to extend a hand to all the oppressed and victims who are waiting for help, wherever they are in the world. May God not give an opportunity to those who expect our country to kneel and those who try to disrupt the unity and solidarity of our nation.
Brothers
The long nights of Ramadan give us the opportunity to contemplate in our own inner world and to contemplate with our friends, as well as the prayers we perform between iftar and suhoor. We have had the opportunity to evaluate both our own personal world and the issues of our environment and our country in detail.
The events that our country has experienced in the last 6 years alone will be enough to show the magnitude of the game we are facing. We have struggled and taught lessons to those who want to create chaos in the streets, divide neighborhoods with potholes, intimidate our nation with the bloody actions of various terrorist organizations, and besiege us along our borders. In the first period of our government, we stood together against tutelage, FETÃ's police-judiciary coup attempt on December 17-25, and the bloody coup attempt on July 15. Again, we have resisted the devastating effects of the economic attacks that have intensified in recent years, threatening our jobs, our vaccines and our future. In this process, we received great support from all over our country with its 81 provinces. But Istanbul has always been the locomotive of this struggle. Every rally we organized in different places before, and recently in YenikapÄ± with the participation of millions, was almost a challenge of Istanbul against the enemies of our country and our nation.
Now, tomorrow evening, I hope we will hold an Enderun tarawih in YenikapÄ± Square again. The goal is an Enderun taraweeh with 313,000 people. As you know, there were 313 mujahideen in Badr. Now, by putting three zeros next to these 313, we will live there with 313 thousand, God willing, in YenikapÄ± Square, organized by the Enderun Tarawihini Religious Foundation.
While we were screaming that they would not succeed against seven heifers, we knew that Istanbul, with a population of 15 million, was behind us, along with our other cities. Thankfully, Istanbul has never left us alone since 1994. No matter how much we are grateful to Istanbul, which has always been with us both on the field and at the ballot box, and no matter how much we serve, we cannot repay our debt of gratitude. So much so that we find it difficult to even find words to describe our love, affection and loyalty to this city. Even poems describing Istanbul are no longer enough to express our interest. Of course, ÃskÃ¼dar, where we have been living in Istanbul for years, has a special place in our hearts.
In the March 31 elections, we won the elections as the People's Alliance in 25 of the 39 districts of Istanbul, including ÃskÃ¼dar. In the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality elections, we encountered a situation that cast a shadow on democracy and the ballot box, and they stole the votes. The Supreme Election Board decided to renew the Metropolitan elections due to both the illegalities in the formation of the polling stations, the irregularities in the ballot box consolidation minutes and corruption. Our only goal in this process has been to ensure that the manifestation of the national will at the ballot box is recorded in the most accurate and healthy way. If it were not for the problems, troubles, illegalities and corruption that we have uncovered one by one and legally confirmed by the Supreme Election Council, we would not be talking about them today.
No one has the right to criticize us for protecting the will of our nation and the honor of the ballot box. In particular, there is no justification for insulting the members of the Supreme Election Board and targeting them by calling them a gang.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Since when has it become fashionable to seek justice within the law or to call the people there a gang? Those who should be criticized are those who carry out and defend practices that cast a shadow on the ballot box and therefore democracy. On June 23, with a new election free from all these deficiencies, lawlessness and corruption, Istanbul will hopefully have the mayor of the Metropolitan Municipality. Who wins the election is important, of course, but what is far more important is how they win. Every election result held in accordance with the law and conscience has a place above our nation's and our heads.
Now, I ask you to firmly protect the ballot box and the results of the ballot box on June 23. Not going to the polls for whatever reason means surrendering to the will of others at that ballot box. I believe that all the people of Istanbul, especially my fellow citizens of ÃskÃ¼dar, will protect their own will.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
There are both great challenges and great opportunities in front of Turkey. It is up to us to turn these challenges into opportunities. If we do not compromise on our unity, solidarity and brotherhood as a nation, no one can prevent Turkey from achieving its 2023 goals.
Now the goal; In 1994, when I became Mayor, he was the General Manager of IDO, and then the Minister of Transport. Later, the Prime Minister, then the President of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, and by holding these positions, we presented my companion and colleague Binali Yildirim, who has very serious experience in both the national and international community, as a candidate for mayor of the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul. And we want to move our Istanbul to a different place with a mayoral candidate who has this kind of experience.
I believe that all my fellow citizens of Istanbul will protect Mr. Binali on June 23 and hopefully our Istanbul will not be overshadowed. When we reach our goals, it means that completely different doors will be opened in front of our country and we will be in the league of giants in the world. Some people in our country still find it difficult to see this big game. Those who think that the issues of Syria, Iraq, Libya and Cyprus are only the issues of these countries are those who close their eyes to the world. Those who think that the problems we experience in the economy are only the product of our own dynamics are those who are unaware of the big game being played. Those who see the reactions to the steps we have taken to strengthen our national security as ordinary reflexes are those who fail to comprehend the threats to our country. Look, with this Claw Movement, which has neutralized hundreds of terrorists right now, our soldiers of Allah have revealed what position they are in.
Turkey is fighting the most critical struggles of the last century in every field. Like every recent election, the Istanbul elections are a part of this struggle. If someone outside the world is following the results of these elections even more closely than the people of Istanbul, taking sides, screaming for joy or expressing sadness, then there is another game in the middle.
Brothers
Remember, on March 31, you saw how the West and different countries of Europe had fun for the name they thought had won, right? Still don't understand what's behind it? Didn't we understand what's going on? As the make-up on the faces of the people of Istanbul, who were presented as a monument of tolerance, dialogue and modernity with huge image campaigns, began to emerge. I believe that my citizen will not entrust Istanbul to a person who has no success story in his life, who comes to the fore not with his works, but only with rudeness, insults, threats, intolerance, and all these.
Hopefully, the people of Istanbul will make the right choice on June 23. And I think all my fellow citizens should convey this to all their relatives and friends. With these feelings, I once again congratulate you on your Ramadan, Night of Power and Eid al-Fitr.
I would like to thank the Mayor of ÃskÃ¼dar and the team for this beautiful meeting.
Brothers
Let's be one, let's be big, let's be alive, let's be brothers, let's be together, let's be Turkey together. I greet you all with love and respect, with good health.

Dear Members of Our Foundation,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with the best of greetings, respect and affection. The 39th anniversary of our Unity Foundation. I am very pleased to be with you at the traditional Iftar Program.
It is indeed a source of satisfaction for us to be with you at such a meaningful iftar table of the blessed Ramadan, the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness, and the end of which is salvation from eternal torment.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Unity Foundation, Mr. President and his team, the Board of Trustees, and all the members of the Foundation for sharing their tables with us.
I wholeheartedly congratulate your Ramadan. May Allah grant us all to benefit from the mercy, blessings and wisdom of this blessed month.
On this occasion, I would like to once again thank the founders of our Unity Foundation and everyone who contributed to our Foundation's achievements.
I wish mercy from the Almighty Mevla to our elders and brothers, whom we bid farewell to millet beka.
My Lord has given us the grace to be one of the founders of such a charitable fountain as the Unity Foundation. The sapling, which we planted in the ground in 1985 for the sake of Allah, has turned into a great plane tree whose branches extend to all four corners of our country in the 34 years that have passed.
Today, in addition to its unique contributions to the cultural life of our country, our Unity Foundation fills a serious gap with its educational activities for our youth. In addition, the commissions established for different professions within our Foundation carry out valuable works in their fields. In addition to all these, the Unity Foundation has been taking an admirable stance in the face of all the attacks targeting the national will and democracy in our country recently.
I owe a debt of gratitude to all my brothers and sisters who supported our nation's struggle for rights and justice.
I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for protecting this country, which is the hope of the oppressed and the victims, and the great and powerful cause of Turkey.
Hopefully, as we have done for 34 years, we will not tarnish our brotherhood in the next period. In spite of those who try to disrupt our unity, we will continue to fight by tightening our ranks around our blessed cause. Hopefully, we will clasp our shoulders together and keep our eyes out of our range for a moment. We are forbidden to stop, rest and be complacent until we achieve our goals as a country and a foundation. On the contrary, we need to increase the pace a little more and take the steps faster.
We need to focus more on educational and cultural activities for the young generations to whom we will entrust our future in the activities of the Foundation. Both the scenes we witnessed during the Gezi protests and the great betrayal we experienced on the night of July 15 showed us all how heavy the burden on the shoulders of the Unity Foundation is. Nature does not accept a vacuum.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As we have seen in both incidents, if we do not take care of it, it is only a matter of time before our young people become the playthings of malignant hands that are enemies of the homeland, nation and country. If we do not fill the hearts and minds of our children with kindness, envy, the call to prayer and the consciousness of the flag, terrorist organizations will inject their poisonous ideologies there. If we do not instill our ancient values in the younger generations, if we do not make them love and keep them alive, the streets, television, tablets and phones will raise them with the eunuch codes of popular culture.
I say it very clearly and clearly, the plague of every young person we lose to hordes of killers such as FETÃ, PKK and DAESH is on us, our volunteer organizations. Look, this nation still carries in its heart the pain of the young saplings that it sacrificed in the 1970s to the right-left fight. This nation is still shedding tears for its sons, whom the separatist organization forcibly abducted to the mountains and turned into killing machines. This nation is experiencing the trauma of its young people, who have been manipulated by the perverted ideology of FETÃ for 40 years. None of us has the right to inflict similar pain and tragedy on our nation again. In the words of the late Akif; ""History repeats itself for those who don't learn their lesson."" If we do not want history to repeat itself, what we need to do is to continue our work with a tighter, more encompassing and more visionary understanding. From student scholarships to conferences, from courses to competitions, I see every activity of our Foundation for our young people as a valuable step in this direction.
May Allah bless you, all our brothers and sisters who provide financial and moral support to the Unity Foundation.
Dear Friends,
As a nation, as I have just stated, we are trying to comprehend the blessed Ramadan, the sultan of 11 months, whose beginning is mercy, forgiveness in the middle, and salvation from eternal torment, in accordance with its meaning and spirit.
Ramadan is a month in which we do our internal accounting in accordance with the divine command to take your soul into account before it is called to account. Ramadan is a month of solidarity in which we open our table to our neighbors, the needy, relatives and relatives. Above all, for us believers, Ramadan is a blessed month in which we learn patience through fasting, purify our hearts through worship, and become conscious of being a servant through contemplation.
However, as in almost every Ramadan, the enemies of Islam and humanity do their best to overshadow our joy of Ramadan and add poison to our Ramadan table during these holy days. The Israeli administration is again raining bombs on Gaza, which it has turned into an open-air prison with a blockade and embargo. Syria's bloody regime has no qualms about hitting civilians, hospitals and schools in Idlib with barrel bombs on this day of Ramadan. Hundreds of thousands of children in Yemen are suffering from hunger and famine, victims of a dirty war. In Libya, the outrages of a hired killer are tolerated just for the control of oil wells. From Arakan to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Iraq, unfortunately, smoke and cries are rising again this Ramadan.
We witness that the oppressors always become a little more reckless during Ramadan. In particular, the Israeli administration, emboldened by the silence of the international community, went as far as bombing the headquarters of media outlets and humanitarian aid organizations and bombed our Anadolu Agency. Because all their dirty deeds should not be announced to the world, whoever announces it is an enemy for them. In this way, they think that the murders they committed in Gaza can prevent the public from knowing about their genocidal policies against the people of Gaza. They believe that by targeting aid organizations, they can discipline the people of Gaza with hunger and poverty. However, despite Israel's policies of obfuscation, intimidation and intimidation, Anadolu Agency continues to work by challenging the conditions. Even if they don't want to, our humanitarian aid organizations continue to heal the wounds of those in need by taking all kinds of risks.
While we are doing this, you see that not a single voice of reaction is raised by the organizations that criticize our country on the freedom of the press, neither in the country nor in the international community. When it comes to Turkey, those who immediately raise the alarm are still playing 3 monkeys, even though it has been a week since the attack in Gaza. Look, those who protect even the members of terrorist organizations under the guise of freedom ignore and ignore this attack carried out in front of the cameras. This is not only a double standard, but also complicity in oppression. Separating the victim according to their identity, belief, country and nation is neither humane nor moral.
Brothers;
To put it bluntly, this is not the first time we have encountered this attitude, we are witnessing a similar double standard in almost every issue related to our country, from terrorism to coups. Those who lecture the world on democracy are able to protect the coup plotters in the face of the bloody coup attempt in Turkey in which 251 of our people were martyred. People who talk about their rights can welcome the ringleaders of the terrorist organization that has slaughtered tens of thousands of innocents in Syria with red carpets.
Those who talk about peace see no harm in drowning our region in blood and tears, from Yemen to Libya, just to protect their interests. Those who speak out about justice and freedom do not even raise their voices against the gallows set up by the coup courts in Egypt, on the contrary, the countries of the European Union can sit at the same table with Sisi at his invitation and talk about what they will do with him for the future.
From the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to the heinous act of terrorism in New Zealand, this ambivalence is somehow revealed. Regarding the Jamal Khashoggi incident, there is still no voice, there is still no attitude against the officials sent by Saudi Arabia. And what they tell us is that we will do what is necessary, don't worry. It's not my problem, it's your problem. As Saudi Arabia, you sent 15 people to such a massacre, then you increased the number to 22, they are doing it, you do not take the slightest action against them. Where is your justice? No.
Western countries have not passed the test of sincerity in making a choice between their interests and basic human values, and they have invested their preferences either in dollars or oil, as they have always done, and they have been on their side.
We see that the statements made after the decision of the Supreme Election Council regarding the Istanbul elections are the product of the same point of view. The issue here is neither the ballot box, nor the national will, nor supporting Turkey's struggle for democracy. In Austria, the presidential election can be canceled after 2 years, after 2 years, have you ever heard any voice, have you heard any reproach about how such a thing can happen? Look, after 2 years, the presidential election can be canceled. In our country, on the other hand, even our application disturbs the West. This is the struggle to seek the right of our national will, this is the struggle to seek the rights of those who set their hearts on us. And we struggled to seek our rights, and thanks to the YSK, they confirmed our rightful decision.
The aim of those who target our country through the decision of the Supreme Election Council is to dynamite the 17-year achievements of our nation and to undermine Turkish democracy. This is the reason why they turn a blind eye to the organized irregularities in the March 31 elections, or more precisely, the corruption at the ballot box. Because the sincere cannot falsify the truth, he tries to read and understand it. Those who act in a principled manner first try to determine whether the evidence presented objectively and whether the step taken is legal or not. When they look at our country, they see only their prejudices, not the truth. They don't want to accept the difference between the old Turkey and the real Turkey in their minds. They refuse to see the great change our country has experienced in the last 17 years. They cannot comprehend that there is no longer a Turkey waiting in front of them and that they will not give orders and instructions to this country. However, whether they accept it or not, Turkey is an independent, sovereign, democratic country that believes in the rule of law.
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Turkey is not anyone's client or mandate. Those who host coup plotters on their lands cannot give us a lesson in law. Those who are trying to overthrow the elected president of Venezuela cannot tell us about democracy. Those who do not raise their voices against Israeli terrorism cannot say anything about the struggle for rights we are waging within the framework of our Election Law.Â  By Allah's leave, our nation will not bow down to these pressures and threats.
I believe that just as the Turkish nation protected its will on July 15 at the cost of its life when necessary, it will make its choice with its free will on June 23. By Allah's leave, Turkish democracy will emerge from the June 23 test with the whites of its forehead.
Brothers
In the coming period, all of us, especially you, my brothers and sisters in this hall, have very important duties. We have overcome all the attacks so far by sticking together. We have never brought strife between us, we have never tarnished our brotherhood. And now the mentality we are facing right now, you see, they are giving a message somewhere with the mouth of FETÃ and the mouth of FETÃ.
We must not allow our differences of opinion to get in the way of our friendship in the cause. Free from the positions we hold, we are all devotees of our blessed cause, in which we believe and spend our lives. Seats, duties, and honors are all invalid and temporary, and this dome that remains is a pleasant sound. This is what we have been trying to do in politics for 40 years. Infallibility and perfection are reserved only for Allah, the Lord of the worlds. We have had and will have our mistakes, shortcomings and shortcomings, but we have not betrayed our cause, which we call Turkey.Â  We will do our internal accounting, eliminate the deficiencies we have identified, and continue our struggle with a more embracing and encompassing understanding.
It was the spirit of the 1994 elections that carried us to the mayoralty of Istanbul. It was the bridge of hearts we established with our nation that brought us to power in 2002. As long as we maintain this bond of spirit and heart, God willing, our nation will continue to trust and support us, I believe in this. When we lose this, it means that we have nothing left to give to our nation. May God protect us from falling into such a mistake. I pray that my Lord will not separate us from the Sirat al-Mustaqim.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank each and every one of you for sharing our iftar table with us once again.
I believe that our Unity Foundation, which will turn 34 on May 29, will continue to increase its activities in line with its blessed mission. Hopefully, we will continue to support our Foundation, of which we are proud to be the founder, with all our means and means, and we will continue to be with you.
Be thankful, be present, be entrusted to God.

Their Speech at the Iftar Program with the Ambassadors,2019-05-10,
Their Speech at the Opening Program of the North Star Mosque and Complex,2019-05-10,"

Dear people of Ankara,
Dear Guests,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
I greet you with the best of greetings, respect and affection. Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi and Barakatuhu. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to congratulate your blessed Ramadan, the fifth day of which we are observing today. I hope that these fruitful days we are in will be conducive to peace, tranquility and prosperity for our country and nation, as well as for all humanity.
May Allah accept and accept the prayers you will make and the prayers you will perform during Ramadan. Just as the Almighty has brought us to Ramadan, the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness, and the end of which is salvation from eternal torment, I pray that he will also bring us to the Eid al-Fitr, which we will realize with our loved ones, families and friends in health, well-being and safety.
Eternal praise be to my Lord, who gave us the good fortune to bring such a magnificent work to Ankara on the blessed Friday. I pray to Allah that the Diyanet Science and Culture Center, which we are officially opening today, as well as the Great Ankara Mosque, will be beneficial to our capital.
This complex, which was built on approximately 80 acres of land in the North Ankara Urban Transformation Zone, has really become a work worthy of Ankara and our Capital with its 15 thousand congregation capacity, guesthouse, covered bazaar, handicrafts, shops, congress and cultural center for 5 thousand people. With its library, parking lot, traditional bath, soup kitchen and other features, the Religious Science and Culture Center will provide versatile services to our nation. I think that the Museum of the History of Islamic Science and Technology, which will be built on the land next to the complex, will add a very different dimension to this place.
I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to bringing this work to Ankara. First of all, I would like to thank our Ankara Metropolitan Municipality and our previous presidents Melih GÃ¶kÃ§ek and Mustafa Tuna. I would like to thank our Housing Authority. Without their vision and efforts, Ankara would not have had such an enormous complex.
I say that Allah may be pleased with all those who have worked in accordance with the divine command in Surah al-Tawbah and have reconstructed and revived the mosques of Allah.
Brothers
Mosques are not just buildings made of stone, brick and concrete. Mosques are sacred places where we, as believers, put aside all our differences, become equal before God, become a community, and perform our duty of servitude five times a day. Beyond being places of worship, our mosques are architectural works that reflect the different characteristics of our civilization with their architecture, decorations, calligraphy and illuminations, and the place where they are located. Above all, our mosques are structures that give identity, personality and character to the cities in which they are built.
Almost all of the symbolic cities of our civilization are remembered with a symbolic mosque, madrasa and complex. We cannot imagine Istanbul without Sultan Ahmet, SÃ¼leymaniye, Edirne without Selimiye, and Bursa without the Grand Mosque. When we think of Mardin, Erzurum, Konya and Kayseri, we first think of their madrasahs and mosques, each of which is equally beautiful. It is not possible to describe Ankara without HacÄ± Bayram Veli Mosque and tomb. Kocatepe Mosque, which was completed with the efforts of the late Ãzal, is also one of the symbolic works describing Ankara in the recent period. Praise be to God, we see that BeÅtepe Millet Mosque and Melike Hatun Mosque have joined the symbols of our Capital in a short time. In addition to our fellow citizens from Ankara, our citizens who come to our city on different occasions definitely visit these places.
The BÃ¼yÃ¼k ÃamlÄ±ca Mosque, which we opened last week, has already become one of the monuments of Istanbul. All members of our nation, men and women, young and old, run to the BÃ¼yÃ¼k ÃamlÄ±ca Mosque not only on blessed days and nights, but also during morning prayers, and perform their prayers in a climate of complete love. It can gather more than 60 thousand congregations under the dome and in its courtyard.
I believe that the Religious Science and Culture Center, which embodies the most beautiful features of Ottoman, Seljuk and modern architecture, will also leave its mark on Ankara. This monumental work will re-embrace the Ankara of the Republic with the Ankara of the Seljuks and the Ottomans, and will strengthen the ancient identity of our city, which has been suppressed for years.
Brothers
Since the construction of Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, mosques have been the center of life in Islamic societies and the heart of their surroundings. Just as the heart is the main organ that sustains human beings, temples keep the society alive, keep it alive and sustain it as a center of knowledge, wisdom and virtue. Turning our mosques into places of worship where only prayers are performed and dispersed is the greatest disrespect that can be done to them. The ornament of the mosques is the congregation, especially the youth. A mosque that is not filled with the joy of our children, the excitement of our youth, the experience of our pir-i mortals, and the kindness and skill of our women is sad and orphaned. Mosques where children do not come, young people do not visit, and women do not take care of them are doomed to remain with their necks bent, no matter how magnificent they are.
Today, as in the past, we need to encourage and encourage a mosque-centered life. In particular, we should not build artificial walls between our mosques and the young generations, who are the guarantee of our future. We should organize activities that will warm the hearts of our young people to mosques.
By answering the call that reminds us of our servitude five times a day, we must first accustom ourselves and then our children's feet to mosques.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I hope that the Religious Science and Culture Center will be instrumental in good deeds. On this occasion, I commemorate with mercy our Professor Doctor Fuat Sezgin, one of the most valuable scientists raised by our country, who passed away last year. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my brothers and sisters who protect our mosque with their prayers, prayers, remembrances, lessons and scholars.
I pray that the prayers to be held in our complex will already be accepted and accepted in the sight of God. I pray that Allah does not leave us without love, without water, without air, without a state, without a temple, without a minaret and without a call to prayer.
May Mawla be our helper. Have a blessed Friday.
I say stay healthy and invite our teacher to prayer.

Dear people,
Dear people of Ankara,
Dear brothers and sisters;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your love, affection, support and brotherhood. I praise my Lord for giving me companions, companions in the cause, and companions in struggle like you.
Throughout our political life, we have never had any purpose other than serving our cause and our nation. We did not recognize any power above the national will. Our nation has been with us in every struggle we have entered since I became the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality in 1994.
Brothers;
As the AK Party, I would like to express my gratitude to each and every member of my nation who has always brought us out on top in all deputy, presidential, local administration elections and popular votes since the November 3, 2002 elections.
Today, our nation made us first in the ballot box for the 15th time. As the AK Party, we have won a total of 778 mayorships, including 16 metropolitan cities, 24 provinces, 538 districts and 200 towns, in the places where we entered the elections alone or together with the People's Alliance. This means that approximately 56 percent of the municipalities in our country will be governed by the AK Party.
Some think they are in a millet barn. They need to know this: Is this brother of yours the President for 4.5 years? Is the AK Party in power? Therefore, are we in Parliament as the People's Alliance? And just as we have come so far on this path, we will continue in the same way from now on.
The People's Alliance's vote share is close to the June 24 elections. As the People's Alliance, which we established together with both the AK Party and the MHP, I would like to express my gratitude once again to my nation, which made us the first in the ballot box. I would like to thank MHP Chairman Mr. BahÃ§eli and all my brothers and sisters who have set their hearts on this party for protecting the People's Alliance.
I would like to express a very important issue in particular. I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens, especially my Kurdish brothers and sisters, who have protected our sensitivity on the issue of survival. The election results of our Southeastern Anatolia region are a very important lesson that our Kurdish brothers and sisters have given to those who put their will at the bargaining table.
I wish success to all our mayors, municipal councilors and provincial council members who took office with the favor of their voters in our metropolitan cities, provinces, districts and towns. I would also like to congratulate our mukhtars elected in our neighborhoods and villages, which I see as the first step of democracy.
Brothers;
I think that the only reason for the results in this election where we did not get the results we wanted was that we could not adequately explain ourselves to our people and enter their hearts enough. During the official campaign period of only 50 days, we made an effort to express ourselves to our nation with 59 provincial and 43 district rallies and 9 television and social media programs. However, if we have shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them. We cannot look for it in our people, we cannot look for it in our nation, we will look for it in ourselves. As of tomorrow morning, we will start working on identifying and compensating for our deficiencies.
At the moment, the Supreme Election Board will announce the results, and if we have objections when it announces it or until the moment it announces it, we will make these objections wherever they are. Whether we get results or not, it doesn't matter. Why? Brothers and sisters, remember this: There is good in everything. This is the struggle for democracy.
For example, you see that most of the districts in Ankara are in the AK Party and the People's Alliance, there is such a picture. At the moment, there are more districts in Istanbul than there were until the moment I moved here, in the People's Alliance or break-even, in such a situation. What does it mean? Again, even if our people give the metropolitan city as the mayor, what did they do in the districts, they gave it to the AK Party, we will focus on them and work well. No one should doubt that we will make every effort necessary, including holding accountable those who have damaged the heart-to-heart path between us and our nation.
We see politics not as a means of stubbornness with the nation, belittling the nation, insulting the nation, but only as a means of bringing the best services to the country and the nation. We have done this so far, and we will do so in the future. Where does a politics without the nation end? It leads to fascism, it leads to dictatorship, it leads to oppression. For this, we have sought the consent and support of our nation in every step we have taken so far. From now on, we will continue on our way in the same way, we will continue with you.
That is why, as I have always said, no one, including myself, is bigger than our cause, no one is more important than Turkey, and no one is more important than our party; We will pay attention to this. We all have power and authority in proportion to the services we render to our cause, our country and our nation, and we are valuable in this proportion.
We cannot direct our country in the same direction without first realizing the continuity of change, which is a fact of life, within ourselves. The coming period will be a period of change for the better and better for both our party and our country. 4.5 years no elections, no elections. What are we going to do? We will focus on our work both nationally and internationally, we will lock in and hopefully we will raise our country above the level of contemporary civilizations.
We will try to make the most of this long period ahead. Who? With my nation, with you. We will struggle to solve all the problems of our country with a reformist approach.
We have significantly prevented the attacks aimed at taking over our country and nation in the economy. With structural reforms, we will definitely build an economic architecture that is more resistant to such attacks. By resolutely continuing the employment mobilization we have started, we will disrupt the schemes of those who covet the jobs, vaccines and bread of our people. Let those who make false promises come and we will see how they will govern. In this process, which continues until we reach our 2023 targets, our priority will be to strengthen our economy, maintain growth in a technology and export-oriented manner, and increase employment.
In the same way, we are entering a period in which we will hopefully succeed in our work on issues related to our national security. We have already partially broken the trap set for our country along our border with Syria. Our goal now is to make Syria a safe place by eliminating the terrorist structures in Manbij and the east of the Euphrates and to ensure that the refugees in our country can return to their homes and homelands.
Brothers;
Our new management system has been in place for about 9 months. In the light of the results we have obtained from this implementation period, we will continue to strengthen the system with new reforms that will complete the deficiencies and overcome the blockages within the framework of fast and effective decision-making and implementation. And my brothers and sisters, we will take all necessary steps in our ministries and institutions, if necessary, in accordance with the dynamic structure of the system. We always say something with some provocative statements, what is it? Don't stop, keep going... We will continue our struggle on this long, thin road day and night. May God help us. I wish the election results to be beneficial to our country and our cities once again.
But I would like to ask one thing in particular from you, my dear brothers and sisters; Don't be offended, don't be offended, 'we didn't expect this outcome'; You don't have to. We have a party that got 52 percent of the votes. The first party in this election is the AK Party. Let others think, we don't have anything to think about at this point. But we say further, we say further, and for this reason, we will continue on our way with other working principles, hopefully, by compensating for what kind of shortcomings we have in this election.
I would like to thank each and every one of you for embracing us with love, affection, kindness and loyalty to the covenant in this cold night. Again, I praise my Lord; O Lord, I cannot praise you enough for giving me such companions. Be thankful, be present, be entrusted to God.

Dear guests,
Dear representatives of our culture and art world,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection.
Today, we are throwing a really important man who will break new ground in the art and cultural life of our country. On November 6, 2017, we have reached a new stage in the direction of the realization of the Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center, for which we carried out the promotional project.
Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center, the foundation of which we are laying, consists of 5 separate blocks with a closed area of 95,600 square meters. The building includes an opera hall with a capacity of 2073 people, a theater hall with a capacity of 828 people, and their stage, backstage rooms and foyer areas. In addition, the project includes workshop and storage areas, ballet practice halls, soloist and orchestra practice rooms, recording studio and rehearsal halls, art galleries, exhibition halls, and public cafes. In addition, this project has been prepared to meet all kinds of needs with meeting rooms, administrative offices, restaurants, and indoor parking.
I believe that this work, which impresses in terms of architecture, aesthetics and use, will further enrich the cultural and artistic activities of our city.
I wish that the AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center project, which has a total investment cost of 860 million liras, will be beneficial for our Istanbul and all of Turkey. I would like to thank in advance all our institutions and organizations that contributed to the realization of this project, from our Ministry to our Mass Housing Administration, from our Municipality to our architects and workers.
Hopefully, we will work hard and complete the Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center in a short period of 2 years and put it into the service of our artists and art lovers. Thus, we will bring a magnificent work worthy of the glory of our Istanbul, the capital of history, civilization and culture, to our city.
Dear friends;
As you have been following closely, we have struggled very hard to bring this project to the groundbreaking stage. Some circles, who see the old building as a symbol of their marginal ideology, have spent all their energy to prevent our project from the very first day. They tried to sabotage the project with various accusations, slanders that do not fit into reason, logic and conscience, and when these were not enough, they tried to sabotage the project by stirring up the streets. During the slander campaign that started in 2007, they resorted to lies such as that we would build a shopping mall instead of the AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center, that we would build a mosque, and that we would change its name.
They did the same when we were building the Harbiye Congress Center, they said that we would eliminate the theater there, that we would remove the theater hall and that nothing would be done in the place of the congress center. What's wrong? We built a larger theater hall there, we built a giant congress center underground with a capacity of 3 thousand people, it is almost like an opera, we built it, and since that day, it has been appealing not only to our country, but also to the whole world.
From 2007 onwards, inspections by different institutions made it clear that the old building was no longer usable. Especially after the earthquake, this place was in an unbearable condition. The same reports also showed that the old building was no different from a slum in terms of earthquake resistance. Moreover, with a population of more than 15 million today, the number of foreign tourists reaching 13 million every year, and the increasing demand for art and works of art, the old building could no longer meet the expectations of Istanbul.
The project prepared by the Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture Agency for the repair and strengthening of the old building was also prevented by these circles by making it the subject of a lawsuit. What we've suffered, their job is to always thwart the powers-that-be, the same mentality, so they don't have a standing tree. Dude, watch from the sidelines, at least see what is being done; no.
Neither scientific data, nor reports, nor other facts were enough to convince the circles whose only food was abuse and provocation. Because those who opposed the demolition of the old building and the construction of a more beautiful, more modern and more spacious building were acting with ideological bigotry, not with cultural and artistic sensitivity. In the words of their ancestors, these circles were not after eating grapes, but after beating the winegrower, and they did not hesitate to reveal these intentions at almost every opportunity.
We all know very well, we remember very well what these so-called art lovers did during the Gezi protests, right next to us, how they humiliated our nation, how they desecrated the old building here with the rags of terrorist organizations. Supposedly, those who act with the sensitivity of the AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center have turned the AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center in Gezi into a tool to attack our democracy, to loot the property of our shopkeepers, and to burn and destroy our streets. We lived it here, we lived it on Istiklal Street, we lived it in this square, we lived it on the whole faÃ§ade of the AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center. What were we going to do, were we going to cruise? They hung pictures of all kinds of terrorists there. While terrorizing the streets for days, they used the old derelict building here as an excuse to write on the walls of this blessed city, where there is a martyr's grave on every corner, that ""the persecution began in 1453"".
We did not succumb to their threats either during or after the Gezi vandalism. Despite the street terrorists who have mentally and spiritually severed all ties with these lands, we continued on our way with the love of bringing a work worthy of our country and Istanbul, we did not stop. Today, we are reaping the fruits of 10 years of patience.
You just watched it on the screen, what kind of work we will have as an animation, you watched this, especially when it is over, it will be different. At the moment, it has come to the screen again, I have really watched the animation of it many times, we listened to the project friends, thanks to TabanlÄ±oÄlu, especially Murat Bey and his brothers, and we prepared for today, but we prepared decisively. And now, together with the contractor, we will hopefully finish this place in two years.
The building we will lay the foundation of is not only a cultural center, this work will also be the best answer to the enemies of the homeland and the nation, who have been attacking the national will for the last 5 years. Istanbul will find itself in this project, Istanbul will find itself in this project with its national cafÃ©, with its restaurant, with everything.
Against those who are trying to condemn Turkey to darkness, we are building a work that is a symbol of our ideal of bringing our country to a bright future. Above all, the Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center will be a monument of victory against the Jacobin mentality, which is at odds with the values and beliefs of the nation, the history and culture of our people. Hopefully, when it is completed in two years, this work will become one of the sources of pride not only for Istanbul but also for all of Turkey, and the world will commemorate this work.
Dear brothers and sisters; In fact, this is not the first time that Turkey has been confronted with the 'undesirable' mentality that is the enemy of service and investment. Throughout the history of the Republic, whenever our country has tried to make a move and break its shackles, it has always found this mentality in front of it. The moves made by our country in industry, defense, production, transportation, technology, and almost every field of revenue have been constantly prevented by our adversaries abroad and by certain segments at home.
The life of the deceased Menderes was spent struggling with the mentality until that black day when he breathed his last on the gallows. The late Ãzal's efforts to revive our country since 1983 have also been subjected to sabotage by these circles. From our late teacher Necmettin Erbakan to the late Alparslan TÃ¼rkeÅ, this gang was the first to stand against all the leaders whose hearts beat for the welfare of our nation and sweated for the ideal of a great and strong Turkey. No matter how many politicians, businessmen and entrepreneurs our people commemorate with blessings, almost all of them have had their share of lynching campaigns.
Here, I would like to share with you a memory of Nuri DemiraÄ, one of the most visionary people our country has produced. I think this anecdote is extremely important in terms of understanding the CHP mentality. This event is truly exemplary, especially for the younger generations to learn what our country has gone through in the past and what kind of troubles it has overcome.
In 1931, the late Nuri DemiraÄ, in Istanbul, started the studies of the Bosphorus Bridge project that would connect Asia to Europe. In 1934, he made an agreement with America's largest steel company and completed his project, which also included a railway. The project was presented to Gazi Mustafa Kemal through his aide-de-camp and was highly appreciated by Gazi. The veteran forwards the project to the Government for the necessary action. Do you know what the Minister of Public Works of the CHP government of the time would do with this project? He rejects the project on the pretext that it 'spoils the beauty of the Bosphorus'.
In other words, 3 bridges have been built on the Bosphorus now, we have spoiled the beauty of the Bosphorus. Dude, it is not possible to understand them. I guess we put this under the sea so that Mr. Binali would not spoil it. Now, both Marmaray and Eurasia Tunnel go under the sea, we say use whichever one you want. Likewise, the Prime Minister of the CHP government, Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼, prevented the project from being implemented. All these sabotages are carried out despite the will and desire of Ghazi Mustafa Kemal.
He embraces the project of the late Menderes Nuri DemiraÄ, which was left in the air, and receives a report from the General Directorate of Highways that it is possible to build a bridge to the Bosphorus from 9 different places. On May 25, 1960, just 2 days before the coup, a contract was signed with an international company. However, when the May 27 coup took place, the bridge project, like many other services, was shelved.
The first Bosphorus bridge of our country was put into service on October 30, 1973, exactly 40 years after Nuri DemiraÄ's attempt. The Bosphorus Bridge, or the July 15 Martyrs Bridge with its new name, is constantly criticized, targeted, and tried to be prevented by the CHP and other circles both during and after the construction process.
A similar lynching campaign was carried out against the late Ãzal during the construction of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge. Throughout our political life of more than 40 years, we have been the target of the poisoned arrows of these so-called elite, essentially lumpen circles, didn't they do the same to us on the third bridge, the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge? They went to the area where the 3rd bridge is located by sea with motors, they did not have the opportunity to walk, they demonstrated again, they said 'we don't want to'. But we did it in spite of them, we did Marmaray like that, we made Eurasia like that, and now, hopefully, we will build a 3-storey one on the Bosphorus again. They don't know anything about the world, they don't care about serving, let's prevent them anyway; That's the logic.
During our Metropolitan Municipality, Prime Ministership and Presidency, we were constantly criticized and subjected to character assassinations. Not only in the Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center project, but also in all our projects, from Marmaray to the Eurasia Tunnel, from Istanbul Airport to the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, they did the same things for him, they are still doing the same things, and we have been attacked by certain circles.
Look, now I am giving another good news from here, there is Rami Barracks, we are making Rami Barracks the largest library in Istanbul, it continues. Hopefully, the goal is to bring a library of 6 million volumes to Istanbul. Previously, this place was Rami Barracks, and now, I hope, it will become the largest library in Istanbul and Turkey. Secondly, as you know, there are 5 million volumes in the Presidential Complex, and 6 million volumes here; We work, we don't talk.
I call out to my people who are watching us on their screens; That's why don't forget March 31, March 31 is very important at this point. There are those who produce a service, and there are those who produce words, let's distinguish this well from each other.
Dear brothers and sisters, dear young people;
When we look at the last century, we come across many negative examples similar to ours and those before us, many sabotage attempts. Although the excuses are different, their goal has always been the development, development and strengthening of our country. Some circles, who see Turkey as their own property, have also exhibited their indigestion about investments with issues related to our art and cultural life.
They cannot tolerate anyone other than themselves to have a say in art, literature, painting, music and culture. They do not want to give life to the existence of any work of art, any style of art, other than the patterns they have drawn. However, art is not a tool for domination, but a tool for democracy, tolerance and tolerance for differences. Art is the means of man's journey to truth and truth, his search for aesthetics and beauty. Art exists to contribute to the common civilization treasure of humanity, it is made for this.
See how the late Cemil MeriÃ§ defined art and artists; ""I think the artist has only one duty, to make people love each other, two people or 2 billion people. Art is the magic that unites hearts separated by kilometers and centuries with a journey of excitement,"" said the late Cemil MeriÃ§.
Yes, that's how we see art and artists. At almost every opportunity, we draw attention to the unifying, integrative role of art, relieving polarizations and tensions. We consider both modern arts and traditional branches of art as the accumulations and cornerstones of our nation's journey from the past to the future. With this understanding, we try to give all kinds of support to art and our artists they need.
The great increase in the number of cultural centers and stages in the last 17 years is enough to show the position of our country in this field. Do you know what was the number of cultural centers in our country when we took office? 42, we added 63 more to this and increased it to 115. Do you know what the number of stages was in the state theaters? 23, we made 42 additions to it was 65. While the number of private theaters supported was 59, it reached 229 in our country. Since 2002, we have held 88 domestic and 68 international cultural heritage exhibitions.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, we solved one of the most important problems of our cinema industry. Now, we will share a very important good news in the field of culture with our nation. A law to be debated in Parliament this week expands the practice of reducing the VAT rate on books and periodicals to zero, covering both publishers and sellers. We want to spread the love of books even more, to expand their love. When the prices fall, everyone should have the opportunity to buy books and develop. To put it more clearly, there will no longer be VAT on books, magazines and newspapers. Thus, we provide significant support to our publishers, who are disadvantaged with digitalization.
Our aim is to contribute to the construction of a society that reads more, contemplates more, produces more, and a richer cultural world. While we offer places for our young people to study with public cafes, we want to ensure that they can be filled with quality with such applications, good luck in advance.
As in other fields, we will give priority to projects that will bring Turkey forward in culture and arts and bring it together with its goals and dreams. From now on, no one, no segment will be able to condemn our country to mediocrity in culture and art. Those who see the abuse of art and artists as a tool of their politics will not be able to desert Turkey's cultural and artistic life. Hopefully, with the support of our brothers and sisters here, we will join hands together and continue to enrich our culture and art life.
Countries and cities in the world are known for their huge squares. Unfortunately, we are poor in terms of squares. The commemoration of Taksim Square in the past was different, but now we are bringing Taksim Square to the identity we desire, and we will bring it to the identity we desire.
When you go to Rome, the square in Rome is very lively, in Paris it is also very lively, you see all the tourists there and all the liveliness is there. I hope Taksim will become this, Sultanahmet will hopefully become this again, BeyazÄ±t Square will become this way again, and we are longing for this. By achieving this, I believe that the field of attraction should become much stronger in a city like Istanbul. And as of April 1, I hope these steps will be taken with the AK Party municipality and this area of attraction will be enriched in a very different way.
As I conclude my words, I wish the Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Cultural Center, the foundation of which we have laid once again, to be beneficial.

Dear members of our world of culture, art and literature,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with love and respect.
I respectfully commemorate Emin Ongan, the monumental name of our music, and Ara GÃ¼ler, the monumental name of our photography art, to whom we will present the 2018 Special Awards of our Ministry of Culture and Tourism to the institutions established in their names.
I find it appropriate that the Ministry of Culture and Tourism Special Award should be given to the Emin Ongan ÃskÃ¼dar Music Society and the Ara GÃ¼ler Archive and Research Center Ara GÃ¼ler Museum, which I see as institutions that will transfer the ancient accumulation of our culture and art to future generations.
ÃskÃ¼dar Music Society has been in our memories as an institution where the thinnest, most naÃ¯ve and most distinguished works of our art have been performed by masters and passed on to new generations.
Yahya Kemal expressed it beautifully; ""A lot of people can't understand our old music, and anyone who doesn't understand it doesn't understand anything from us."" Yes, our old music is one of our values that requires effort to learn, understand and perform, and as such, it is among our values that we need to protect like a rare jewel.
During the single-party period, our music, like many legacies of our ancestors, was labeled as the product of an outdated mentality and tried to be destroyed. The late Menderes showed that he was a man of the nation by lifting the prohibitions on our music, as in many other areas.
I also call the addition of Emin Ongan, who devoted half a century of his life to the work of the society, to the name of our art institution, which we will give an award, as an example of loyalty.
Ara GÃ¼ler was a real gentleman with whom we had the opportunity to meet frequently, especially in recent years. He is an artist who has spent his life behind the camera viewfinder and has evaluated his country and the world from a much broader perspective. However, Ara GÃ¼ler used to object to being called an artist in life, saying that he was only a photojournalist. But we, as people who can see and understand the spirit behind the products he creates with his photographs, are honored to call him an artist.
The archive and museum he left behind will keep Ara GÃ¼ler's art alive after his death and hopefully pass it on to future generations. For this reason, I would like to especially thank DoÄuÅ Group for protecting such a legacy.
I would like to express my gratitude to our Ministry and jury for their choice, which I see as a sincere support for our culture and art institutions.
On this occasion, I would like to congratulate once again all our culture and art people and institutions to whom awards have been presented since 1979, and I wish God's mercy on those who died. I would like to respectfully commemorate each of our culture and art people who add value to our country with their knowledge, experience, talents and efforts, and represent our flag in the international arena.
Dear friends;
If a nation does not have aesthetic taste, it is not possible for other studies in that country to achieve the desired results. If art and literature are paralyzed in a society, it is difficult to produce and maintain common values in that society. Again, if a country does not have a developed architectural understanding, the superstructure in that country cannot be expected to reflect a unique spirit and identity. On the other hand, we clearly see that societies that neglect the spiritual satisfaction of their people and rule only with material assets cannot leave permanent traces in history.
The common features of ancient civilizations and great states in history are that they have produced important values in the field of culture and art. The way to transfer the material and spiritual accumulation of the civilizations of the nation or nations to future generations is cultural and artistic values and architectural works.
States that attach importance to culture and art not only gain prestige in their periods, but also have the honor of being recorded as an ancient civilization in the pages of history. People and states have come and gone, but these values have survived. Hopefully, it will be inherited by future generations in the same way.
The traces of the states we have established in our geography, especially the Seljuks and the Ottomans, are like the seals of our civilization and culture on these lands. Our duty was to behave in a manner worthy of this great civilization treasure we inherited, and to be worthy of our ancestors and an example to our children with the new works we would sign in the fields of culture, art and architecture.
As a nation, the way to unite around common values and goals is to add new ones on top of the historical accumulation in all these areas. No matter how they are named, no matter what movement they belong to, works of art that transform the accumulation of our geography into value, put people at the center, and exemplify our nation's life experience and view of its environment have made our existence on earth even more meaningful.
It is not the archives that keep the most authentic and solid records of the life of the nation, but the real men of culture, men of letters, men of art, their products. In our art, our architectural work is not only an architectural work, but more than stone and wood. In our art, a musical work is not just a word or a note, it is not just a composition, it is not a lyric, it is not just a sound, it is more than that. ""Poetry came and was based on the word,"" says one of our poets, poetry is not just about words and harmony, it is more than that.
Regardless of the branch of art, it is the duty of our state to support qualified production and to ensure that this production is shared on a global scale. Today, we understand much better how the productions, which most of us turn their noses up at as popular culture products, create a population in the world on behalf of the nations that produce them.
For nations, sometimes successes that cannot be achieved with diplomacy, military power or economic power are achieved with a work of music, a work of literature, a work of cinema. In today's world, where the speed of communication is dizzying, the power of culture and art to influence and transform has become incomparably more important than in the past.
Dear friends;
In our opinion, behind the unity, solidarity and affection in these lands is our unique wealth and treasures in the field of culture and art. We need the power, influence and inclusiveness of culture and art to protect our assets and carry them to the future.
As someone whose cultural and artistic activities had an important place in his youth, we gave importance to this issue wherever we assumed responsibility. During my term as the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, we have carried out great works, works and works in the field of culture and art, as well as other issues of the city.
During the period of our governments, we have always given special importance to the field of culture and arts, and we especially patronized projects in this direction. We have taken care to be in constant consultation with our culture and art people and to benefit from their experience. By encouraging AK Party municipalities in this direction, we tried to ensure that our civilization values are protected. However, as I always say, when I look at the past 16 years, I always lament and sigh that we have not made enough progress in the field of culture and arts.
I see the issue of culture and arts as a matter of survival for our country and our nation at least as important as the fight against terrorism, at least as important as foreign policy, at least as important as basic service areas. Hopefully, in the new period, we will eliminate this deficiency and bring culture, art, architecture and urbanism in our country to the level it deserves. In this regard, our Ministry of Culture and Tourism has great duties.
In the field of tourism, we are largely comfortable due to the acquis of our Minister. I believe that our Minister will make a historic move for our country with his team in the fields of culture and arts. I want you to know that I am with you every step of the way as President. The Culture and Art Policies Board, which we have established within the Presidency, will contribute to the construction of policies in this field and will follow the studies carried out.
With these feelings, I would like to congratulate the representatives of the Emin Ongan ÃskÃ¼dar Music Society and the Ara GÃ¼ler Archive and Research Center Ara GÃ¼ler Museum, who were once again deemed worthy of the 2018 Ministry of Culture and Tourism Special Awards. I would like to thank everyone who supports the activities of these institutions, which I believe will continue to make significant contributions to the cultural and artistic life of our country in their fields.
I would like to express my love and gratitude to all the culture and art people of Turkey. Stay healthy.

Honourable Ministers,
Dear Secretary General,
Dear brothers and sisters;
Peace be upon him, mercy and blessings. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon us. The Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has held the 34th Session of the COMCEC. As I open the session of the Council of Ministers, I greet all of you with my heartfelt feelings, affection and respect.
In my capacity as the Summit Chairperson of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the President of the COMCEC, I welcome you, our esteemed guests, to our country. I am very fortunate to welcome you once again in our beautiful Istanbul, the cradle of civilizations and the pride of humanity. From here, I convey my deepest sympathies to our brothers and sisters all over the world, to our friends, and to all the oppressed whose eyes and hearts are directed towards us.
From this holy city, which our Prophet rewarded and heralded its conquest; From Mecca to Medina, from Sarajevo to Islamabad, from Cairo to Kabul, I greet the sister cities of Istanbul. In particular, I salute Palestine, the homeland of civilization, peace and goodness, and Al-Quds al-Sharif, the apple of the eye of Palestine and the whole world of Islam. I send my greetings to the young sons, daughters and women of Palestine who put their lives on the line for the protection and defense of Jerusalem, and to the Palestinian refugees who have been shedding tears for 70 years with homesickness.
I would like to address my brothers and sisters with the following magnificent verses of the late Mahmud Darwish, which pierced the hearts of the invaders like an arrow:
""And I swear,
I'll process a handkerchief by tomorrow,
adorned with poems that I offer to your eyes
And in a sentence, sweeter than honey and kisses:
""There was a Palestine,
there's a Palestine again!""
Yes, as long as there are Muslims, as long as there are people who defend rights, justice and freedom, Palestine will continue to exist, God willing. By Allah's leave, no oppression, no oppression will be enough to extinguish the fire of freedom in the hearts of the Palestinians. As long as the Palestinians, who are a monument of courage and sacrifice, stand up for their cause, the occupiers will never achieve their goals.
I pray to Allah Almighty that the 34th COMCEC Ministerial Meeting will be beneficial for our region, our countries and humanity, especially for Palestine. May God grant us to implement the decisions we will take as a result of the consultations we will hold today. I believe that you, our friends who are here today to represent their countries, share the same feeling and sensitivity.
Dear brothers and sisters, distinguished guests;
Today's COMCEC Ministerial Meeting is the 1st Session of the Ministerial Summit of the COMCEC, where the fate of our region is almost decided. We are on patrol for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War II. Although a century has passed since this war, which was thought to put an end to all wars, but opened the door to more bloody struggles, we are still watching the traumas it caused very closely. In particular, the geography we are in is one of the places that experience the victimization and destructive effects of war the most.
It is only possible to find solutions to the problems directly related to the results of the First World War if we identify and confirm the source of these problems. We need to turn the 100th anniversary of the great war into an opportunity to understand, to comprehend, and especially to comprehend, rather than a commemoration ceremony. As Muslims, especially as nations whose destinies have been intertwined in the same geography for thousands of years, it is extremely important that we can do this without any complexes. Because history is never a set of events that have happened and finished for us; It is an exemplary document from which we learn lessons together with strength, courage and inspiration. Every incident that took place in the past, every bittersweet case, is a series of events that should be read well, analyzed well, and thought about sensitively for us Muslims.
History, on the other hand, opens itself only to a clear mind, to a sincere effort. Reading history from the perspectives imposed on us will not serve to understand, but to amplify existing prejudices. Dealing with our own history with an orientalist understanding will only facilitate the work of those who feed on conflicts between Muslims. It is vital that we approach the issue by freeing ourselves from the shackles that stereotypes and prejudices put on our minds.
Today, the following fact is once again evident. Although it ended 100 years ago, the debris left by this war in our geography has not yet been fully removed. In the human, political, economic and social spheres, as Muslims, we are still facing the problems caused by the First World War. While those who carried the war to the Middle East and Africa with imperialist intentions continue their lives in peace and prosperity today, we are still paying the price for the conflicts and tensions they caused, even a century later.
While those who have destroyed our geography are reinforcing their solidarity through different unions and partnerships, we are still falling against each other and falling more and more apart. Here, I would like to state very clearly and clearly that; From Syria to Iraq, from Yemen to Palestine, the crisis, tension, blood and tears we are experiencing in the whole region is based on the design made with the great war. If millions of people are starving in Yemen today, there is no need to look elsewhere for those responsible. Who is responsible? It is us again, that is, Muslims, so-called Muslims. The state of those children who are skin and bones, the state of that poor strange gureba, we are still spectators in the face of all this.
Unfortunately, our Palestinian brothers and sisters have been the biggest victims of this design, which was implemented with dark types like Lawrence in Western capitals. Millions of our Palestinian brothers and sisters have not only lost their lands, but have also been subjected to the worst injustices in the world. Here is the Palestine of 1948 and the Palestine of 2018. Israel of 1948, here is Israel of 2018. On the contrary, you see the area right now, how did they get here? What did all of humanity do in the face of all this?
Of course, policies that are incompatible with the history, social and human dynamics of our region have caused pain, destruction and fratricidal strife not only in Palestine but also in other places. With the First World War, Western countries exported the diseases that had been gnawing at their own bodies for centuries to the Middle East. While security and prosperity fell to their share in this transaction, conflict and misery remained on the other side.
Dear brothers and sisters;
Of course, we cannot rewind history, it is not possible to deny the past or ignore the events that have taken place. So what are we supposed to do as Muslims? What we need to do on the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War; To learn from history is to learn a lesson. Our duty is to build a much brighter future by being inspired by the past. We should no longer fall into the traps set by those who act with the logic of 'a drop of oil is more valuable than a drop of blood'. We should not build new borders and new walls in our hearts in a geography whose borders are drawn with blood. We should no longer fall for the tricks of those who try to make us hurt each other by scratching our differences.
Racism and sectarianism are at the forefront of the diseases that have captured Western societies for years, caused great destruction and massacres in Europe, and were injected into our geography with the First World War. In particular, sectarian bigotry is the most serious problem that weakens Islamic societies from within and makes them vulnerable to foreign interventions in many places today. This fitna, which manifests itself in the form of putting one's mashrab before one's religion and even religiosizing one's sect, has no place in Islam. According to our belief, everyone who turns to the same Qibla, believes in the same God, the same Prophet and the same Holy Book is our religious brother. It is not anyone's place or right to narrow the boundaries of the Islamic brotherhood drawn by our Lord and Prophet (S.A.W.). There is and should be a place in the heart of a believer, not only for the members of the 1.7 billion Islamic Ummah, but also for all humanity.
See what the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.) commands us in this regard in his Farewell Sermon. ""Listen to my word well, remember it well. Your Lord is one, your father is one, your religion and your Prophet are also one. You are all from Adam, and Adam was created from dust. No one has superiority over anyone else. Supremacy in the sight of Allah is only through piety. A Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. Thus, all Muslims are brothers. Your blood, your lives, your right to life, your property, your honor, your dignity and dignity, your bodily integrity are worthy of respect and protection and are inviolable until the day you meet your Lord.""
Yes, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) showed the way of salvation to all humanity together with Muslims with his orders and recommendations 14 centuries ago. No one has the right to act indifferently, let alone violate these red lines.
Dear brothers and sisters,
No one can stand in the way of collective beating hearts. As long as we observe our fraternity law and act in unity and solidarity, none of our problems are insurmountable. We will not look for the solution in others, but in this community, there is no need to go anywhere else. We will expect help and contribution to the solution of our problems, not from others, but primarily from our brothers and sisters, from each other. It is a futile effort to get rid of the problem itself. As a matter of fact, we have seen and are experiencing the uselessness of seeking help from foreign states in many injustices we have been exposed to in many events that have burned us in the last century.
Haven't we been disappointed by the international organizations whose doors we knocked on for a solution on everything from the Palestinian issue to the civil wars? What do we expect from there, what do we hope for? They will never work for our good. In particular, we have experienced very closely that structures such as the United Nations Security Council, which are responsible for ensuring global peace and stability on paper, mostly work to protect the interests of permanent members. In the United Nations Security Council, we see a world condemned between the lips of one country. The whole world is 194 countries, connected to it; There are 5 permanent members and everyone is obliged to do whatever one of them says, you cannot do anything.
Unfortunately, we have come back empty-handed in every crisis where we expected these organizations and the so-called great powers to contribute to regional peace. We have personally witnessed that they do not think about the starving children in Somalia as much as they think about the number of whales in the poles. We have repeatedly seen that concepts such as democracy, human rights, and freedom are meaningful only as long as they serve their own interests. Do they have a problem with the people who died during that migration in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean? We now know very well that there is very little value that they value other than money, oil, diamonds and gold.
Behind our objection that ""the world is bigger than 5"", which we often express as Turkey, there are these bitter experiences, these disappointments, these double standards. Now we 1. We don't live in a post-World War II world, there is a new world now. No matter how many members the United Nations has, 20 of them should be given the right to become permanent members if they will be 20 on a rotating basis, or more if they will be more. With 5 permanent members and 15 temporary members, sorry, no one should deceive anyone. Are there any value in the 15 temporary members there? No. Raise your hand, lower your hand; That's what they do. Everything is between the lips of those 5 members, or even one member within them. Can you expect justice in such a world? Expect. We have always experienced and seen these and it will be like this from now on. This will be the case unless it is changed, reformed.
The United Nations system needs to be reformed. That is why we are fighting to make the Organization of Islamic Cooperation more active and more involved in events during our term presidency. Now, we need to determine a comprehensive policy by taking into account the inability of the existing international structures and their helplessness to find solutions to the problems. As I have always stated, we must cut our own belly.
We, not others, will resolve the crisis in Syria on the basis of the territorial integrity of this country. We will take the initiative and put an end to the conflicts in Yemen that have condemned thousands of children to starvation and death. We will first condemn the treacherous acts against those who pray in mosques in Afghanistan. From Berlin to Paris, from Brussels to Moscow, we will first oppose the killing of innocents, regardless of the identity of the terrorist. We will react before anyone else to banditry and state terrorism that does not hesitate to massacre Palestinian civilians in front of the eyes of the whole world. We will protect the rights and laws of Palestinian refugees who have been burning with homesickness for 70 years in camps in Lebanon and Jordan before anyone else. By encouraging our citizens to visit Jerusalem, we will first prevent the occupiers from extinguishing the lamps of Jerusalem.
We will first raise our voice against the burning of the houses of the Rohingya in Arakan and the ethnic cleansing of our brothers. We will be the first to object to the destruction of the ancient cities of Islamic civilization one by one and the creation of new terrorist states in our region under the pretext of DAESH. We will first say no to the darkening of our future through project organizations such as FETÃ, PKK, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab. We will be the first to oppose the drowning of tens of thousands of African hopeful passengers every year in the raging waves of the Mediterranean. We will take care of the Syrian refugees displaced by war and persecution before anyone else. As adherents of a faith that considers killing an innocent as killing all human beings, we will object to extrajudicial killings and brutal killings before anyone else.
No matter where it takes place in the world, we will be the first to raise our voice against oppression and injustice. Regardless of the borders drawn by the imperialists, we will first observe our neighborly law. First of all, we will not allow our brotherhood to be damaged and blood to be shed over ethnic, cultural and sectarian fault lines. 100th anniversary of World War 1 On the anniversary, we will act with prudence and prudence in order to prevent similar sufferings and similar designs from being made again, and we will learn the necessary lessons together. Only in this way can we alleviate our suffering to some extent and prepare a future full of peace and tranquility for our children.
Dear brothers and sisters;
We need to make the best use of the platforms and tools at our disposal so that we can solve our own problems ourselves. The use of national currencies in trade between us is extremely important in terms of breaking the imperialist shackles on our arms. As the member countries of the COMCEC, the more we invest in each other and the more we increase our trade, the stronger we will be. I would like to underline once again the importance we attach to increasing intra-Islamic trade to 25 percent. I invite the relevant countries to update their concession lists and complete other procedures so that the preferential trade system of Islamic countries can come into force. There is no other way out but to use our domestic and national currency, otherwise we will continue to be crushed under the exchange rate.
Again, I call on all our member countries to participate in the activities of the Islamic Development Bank and its sub-institutions for trade facilitation. As you know, the increase in tariffs by the current administration in America has increased protectionist tendencies in world trade. It is obvious that trade wars will cause serious damage to global trade, production and welfare. Reducing non-tariff barriers and facilitating customs procedures will provide a new opening to world trade and will be a lifeline.
In addition, we urgently need to modernize the infrastructures in our customs, use information technologies more widely, and simplify customs procedures. I find it very meaningful and appropriate that the topic of ""Trade Facilitation and Risk Management in Customs in the Member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation"" was discussed in this year's COMCEC Exchange of Views session. We need to speed up the work so that initiatives such as the preferential trade system, the gold exchange, the real estate exchange and the Istanbul Arbitration Center can be implemented as soon as possible.
I would like to emphasize that we expect your valuable support in all these matters. Enabling the activities carried out under the umbrella of the COMCEC requires a very strong coordination and follow-up infrastructure at the national level. For this purpose, Turkey has established the COMCEC National Coordination Committee under the auspices of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey's Strategy and Budget Department. I hope that this committee, which will meet regularly at least twice a year, will give a significant impetus to our cooperation. We know that there is a national coordination system for COMCEC activities in some of our member countries. I invite other Member States to take the measures they deem appropriate for the coordination of the COMCEC activities at the national level.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to express once again my pleasure to host you in our Istanbul. I hope that the 34th COMCEC meeting will be beneficial for our countries, and I hope that Allah will help us. Be thankful, be present, be entrusted to God. Stay healthy.

Dear Istanbulites,
Dear brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to Allah that the BaÅakÅehir, KayaÅehir, HoÅdere, Baruthane and ÃÄ±rpÄ±cÄ± National Gardens, which we came together to open, will be beneficial to our city, our country and our nation. In addition, I pray to my Lord that the Hasan KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼koÄlu Mosque and HalkalÄ± Mosque, which we will officially open on this occasion, will also be beneficial. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the construction of these beautiful works.
With the public gardens we have put into service, we have fulfilled one of our commitments in our 100-day execution program. We promised, we did; It's not over, we're doing it, we're going to do it.
Our BaÅakÅehir National Garden was established on an area of 360 thousand square meters. This distinguished work is at the center of giant projects such as Ä°kitelli City Hospital, Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, Northern Marmara Highway and Istanbul Canal. Our garden is equipped with facilities that will meet all needs, from the mosque to the indoor parking lot, from the biological pond to the fragrance gardens, from the activity meadow to the public cafÃ©, from walking and cycling paths to playgrounds.
Do you know how much our KayaÅehir National Garden is? It is a project with facilities to meet all kinds of needs on an area of 350 thousand square meters. We do it, they talk about it, that's our difference. In this project, there are many facilities from walking paths to viewing terraces, from the stage to be used for cultural and artistic activities to picnic and playgrounds.
Our HoÅdere National Garden was established on an area of 142 thousand square meters. When I see the participation here today, I praise my Lord, all my citizens are here. Many facilities, from biological ponds to walking paths and orchards, are located in this garden.
Our Baruthane National Garden was established on an area of approximately 60 thousand square meters. In addition to thousands of roses, fruit trees and seasonal flowers, this garden also has a historical identity with its Ottoman Baruthane building. We did not have that historical monument demolished, we protected it.
Do you know how much our Beater Millet Garden is? It is being built stage by stage on an area of 465 thousand square meters. Today we are inaugurating the first 4 phases that have been completed. Once again, I pray to God that all these works will be beneficial.
In addition, the work on 33 national gardens in 18 provinces has reached the final stage. Our goal is to hopefully bring at least one national garden to each of our cities. We don't stop, they gossip. They stand up to whatever is done. We call it Kanal Istanbul, they say 'we don't want it', they say 'don't have it done'. We're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it whether you want it or not.
Brothers;
The size of these 5 National Gardens, which we opened today, reaches 1.5 million square meters. With these projects alone, we have increased the amount of green space per capita in Istanbul by 10 percent. Hopefully, when we open our national garden in the AtatÃ¼rk Airport area, this rate will increase to much higher.
Of course, there is another feature at AtatÃ¼rk Airport; What? We leave one runway there. Hopefully, we are turning the closed areas into fairgrounds, we will have built Turkey's largest fairground with those closed areas at AtatÃ¼rk Airport. Apart from that, I hope we will build a huge national garden there and Istanbul will become more beautiful and more beautiful. This is what suits us, this is what suits this nation, and we will do it. But of course, you also work; We're not going to stop, are we? We will go door to door, we will tell everyone, we will announce what we know to those who do not know.
Those who burned in the name of environmentalism, those who carried out the Gezi protests, those who stand against everything for the good of the country, should come and look at these national gardens and see what real environmentalism is. What did we say when we set out on this journey? We said, 'We love the created because of the Creator.'
For our elders, who say that people build themselves at the same time with the cities they embody, the concept of city means a wide meaning that will include hearts, this is the city. For this reason, when we say service municipality, we express a more comprehensive understanding that includes heart municipality. But I see you differently today, you have a completely different excitement, mashallah. May God bless your excitement.
If we have left a single person in a city whose heart we have not won, we will not have fulfilled our duty properly, even if we rebuild that city from start to finish. For this reason, we see the March 31, 2019 elections as the election of the municipality of the heart, this is how we named it, the municipality of the heart; how? What are we going to do? We will conquer hearts. Service is necessary, but not sufficient. What's enough? Winning hearts. We have come to take hearts. Hopefully, until the election day, we will reach every household and every workplace from the smallest town to Istanbul, the largest city of our country, and we will not leave a hand that we have not touched, a heart that we have not touched, and a heart that we have not conquered.
Brothers;
Remember, colors have a language in nature. For example, the color green is considered the language of healing, peace, trust and spaciousness. For this reason, in our civilization, the color of heaven is green, and it is envisioned as a garden that contains all the beauties of nature, we always say that it is a garden from the gardens of paradise... It is seen that people living in cities with more green spaces are less exposed to one of the biggest threats of today's societies, such as depression. Population growth and the accumulation of people in cities have led to the disappearance of green and thus the deterioration of the peaceful climate, along with many problems.
The destruction caused by the understanding of Western societies that see nature as a 'rival to be defeated' threatens the future of all humanity. Today, people living in Africa, South Asia and Latin America have started to pay the price of global warming before the countries that caused it. Even in our country, we see that the climate is gradually changing, going beyond the routine we knew in our childhood and youth. Despite this, we are witnessing that human beings are becoming more and more reckless, relying on the opportunities provided by technology.
However, what does our Lord say: ""Do not walk on the earth boasting. Remember that you can neither split the earth nor take on the mountains"", this is what our Lord says. Man will continue to pay the penalty for his crimes against nature with his helplessness and the disasters he feels. See what the poet says:
""My tree, the four arms of the apocalypse,
A country in every branch,
My arms grow longer,
Abundance in my stone and soil,
Liberty starts from my roots,
He understands as he hits me,
Rain, it is rain,
Wind, wind.""
The more we respect nature with its trees, soil, rain and wind, and the more space we allocate to it in our environment, the more confidently we can look to our future together. Because we look at Istanbul with this understanding, we have doubled the amount of green space per capita in the city in 16 years. For every tree that has been displaced for various projects, we have ensured that many times more are planted and greened in a suitable place. Last year alone, 180,000 new trees were planted in this city, we approached our 81 provinces with the same understanding and increased our forest assets by 1.5 million hectares. Thanks to the more than 4 billion saplings we have brought together with the soil, we have brought new forests to every corner of our country. The bald hills in many parts of Anatolia are equipped with pine, cedar, oak and juniper trees that exceed human height thanks to the projects we have realized.
Dear brothers and sisters;
In addition to all these, the planting of income-generating trees such as walnuts, almonds and olives in our gardens by our citizens is becoming more and more common. By opening our forests to the use of our citizens, we ensured that our children get to know a life intertwined with nature. We have created and put into service urban forests, especially next to places with a large population. We have increased the number of our national parks, protected valleys and plains. Our Lord commands us to compete in good deeds. Our national gardens project is the end product of our understanding of competing in good deeds, and thank God, it has been embraced with great enthusiasm by our nation. We will continue to work tirelessly with our national gardens, tree plantings and other activities until we make Turkey, especially our cities, green.
Brothers;
In our civilization, there is absolutely no custom of creating backyards to be used as colonies. We believe that prosperity built on other people's sufferings, labors, underground and aboveground riches is doomed to eventually collapse, just like a mansion. For this reason, we follow a policy based on the principles of justice, equity, conscience and sharing, both in our own country and in all corners of our heartland.
We have shown the same determined stance on every issue from our objection that 'the world is bigger than 5' to our African policies, from the Palestinian issue to the Jerusalem and Syria crisis. As a nation, we have given the necessary response to those who want to turn our country into their own backyard at every opportunity, from Ãanakkale to our War of Independence and July 15. Those who could not bring our country to its knees by using terrorist organizations and the coup traitors among us are now seeking to revive their old games by polarizing our nation through artificial discussions.
The fact that Turkey is a country that has advanced in democracy, rights and freedoms, and is rich enough to bring all kinds of opinions, thoughts, ideas and chants to life as long as it does not tend to violence and insults, disturbs some. Look, I'm saying it loud and clear; We are not a country that will be shaken by the games of the minority who have been humiliating, belittling, insulting the nation since the one-party era and who want to impose their own marginal approaches on society. We did not and will not come to this game of the Republican People's Party. We will never leave the square to those who want to cover up their own incompetence, laziness and primitiveness by turning the values of our nation into a tool of abuse. Do we agree? Are we one here? Are we together? Are we big? Are we alive? Are we brothers? Are we all Turkey together? Thank you.
We will not allow our nation to be confused by someone who is incapable of reciting the oath they supposedly defended the most ardent defender, and who is incapable of singing the 10 stanzas and the first 2 stanzas of our National Anthem without any mistakes. Without shame or boredom, he talks to me about whether or not to sing the National Anthem. Go out of there, dude; We grew up with it, we came here with it. You're going to get your bearings first. We put the National Anthem and Safahat as a book under the pillow and we grew up that way. Both our nation and we have full stomachs for these stale games.
In Turkey, we will not allow Gazi Mustafa Kemal, the founder of our Republic, to be insulted, nor any of our citizens because of their beliefs, professions or dress. We see them not as alternatives to each other, but as our riches, which increase our strength when it is always in beer. Of course, there will be criticism, different opinions, different evaluations. No one in Turkey is uncritical, not secular at all. Our red line in this regard is terrorism, violation of personal rights and slander.
CHP members and other political party members who do not hesitate to go to the funerals of terrorists, who go and visit those who are conspiring against terrorism and Kobani in prison, cannot stand up and attack our values in this country. In the criticism of us in the media and especially on social media, we do not resort to any means unless these limits are exceeded. But when it is overcome, the law is the only valid way for us. These areas of privacy and freedom apply to everyone, whether they are still alive or not. I believe that there will be no problem when we give our answer to those who want to drag us into discussions that will waste our energy and time.
We have seen that Turkey derives its main strength from its unity, solidarity and brotherhood, especially in recent years, with numerous experiences. Someone's efforts to revive the ills of old Turkey are futile, we will not come to these games. Someone's efforts to return Turkey to its old oppressive and imposing dark days are also in vain. As always, we will go to our nation, which is the biggest arbiter, and look for the solution there. That is why March 31 is the day when the nation will be arbitrated. Are we ready to be held accountable? Are we ready to give the best and biggest answer while exercising our democratic rights at the ballot box? Thank you.
We will once again bring to the scales of our nation those who abuse AtatÃ¼rk every time they open their mouths, and on the other hand, who have no actions that will carry our Republic, which is entrusted to us, one inch further. The elections of March 31, 2019 will be the day when the report cards of those who have served this country and its cities, and those who only abuse our common values, will appear before our nation.
A significant part of Turkey's cities preferred AK Party municipalism in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Hopefully, in 2019, the preference of our nation will again be in favor of AK Party municipalism, I believe in this. Do we believe it? If so, we are superior. We will join hands with the Presidency, Parliament and municipalities and bring our country to its 2023 goals with the permission of our Lord.
Brothers;
I hope that these 5 National Gardens will be beneficial to our Istanbul and our nation. I wish the nation's coffee houses good luck. We want our puppies to have fun with their mothers and fathers in these gardens as they wish. Let our young people study their lessons in the public cafes, read their books, eat cakes, tea, soup, cakes there. Rest assured, for our hearts are rich; and with this richness of heart, we are marching to March 31 and beyond, God willing.
With these feelings, I wish that the BaÅakÅehir, KayaÅehir, HoÅdere, Baruthane and ÃÄ±rpÄ±cÄ± national gardens, which we have opened once again, and the Hasan KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼koÄlu and HalkalÄ± mosques will be beneficial. I would like to congratulate those who contributed to bringing these works to our city. I offer you my love and respect. Stay healthy.

Speech at the Commemoration of AtatÃ¼rk Program,2018-11-10,
Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Academic Year of the University of Health Sciences,2018-11-07,"

Dear rector and professors of our University of Health Sciences,
Dear students,
Dear guests;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I wish the 2018-2019 academic year of our university to be beneficial.
Our University of Health Sciences is the first higher education institution in our country operating only in the field of health. Our doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and health personnel in other branches will hopefully provide good services to our country and nation. Our university also trains the medical personnel needed by our army. I believe that our military students studying here will also perform good services in their places of duty.
In the same way, our guest students from 61 different countries and our students who grew up in the units of our university in Somalia and Sudan will hopefully provide good services to their own countries and their own people. I wish all our teachers and students a successful academic year.
Dear friends;
Health is one of the areas that we have been focusing on sensitively for 16 years, investing the most and thankfully getting the best results. Yesterday, at our Group Meeting in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, I outlined our actions on health while making a review of 16 years.
Anyone over middle age remembers all too well those terrible images in the hospitals of the past. Receiving services from private hospitals, which were already very few in number, was a privilege reserved only for those who had money or had a lot of money. We know that there are people who sell their houses, cars, goods and property in order to have surgery and treatment in these hospitals. I know very well the times when people were held hostage in private or public hospitals because they could not afford it, and even their dead were held hostage. There were people who signed promissory notes and were forced to flee through the back door.
State hospitals were already serving like a patchwork bundle when they said that there was no insurance, no civil servants, no this institution, no this institution. We use the concept of service as a matter of fact; Because there was not a service in the hospitals, but a semblance of complete misery. It was a period when patient care was already taken with the ward system, that is, 6 patients in a room, a toilet, and when you entered there, you entered and took out the patient intact, there was such a structure. In order to be examined at the hospital, you will first take a queue, for this, you will go the night before and wait in those secluded corridors until the morning, then if you are lucky, you will find a doctor and find an examination.
Come on, you have been examined by the doctor, you will probably not be able to find the devices needed for the examinations. Let's say you put that aside, you will first go to the hospital pharmacy and then go outside to get the medicines prescribed by the doctor. Because it was not possible to find all the medicines prescribed by the doctor in the hospital, if you had one or two, you would go to the pharmacies outside and buy the others with your money, we lived in such a period. If you still manage to stay afloat at the end of all this torment, you will hope for recovery.
We have completely changed this distorted health system. First of all, we have covered all of our citizens under general health insurance. Those who have money pay for their own health insurance, and the state pays the premiums for those who cannot afford it. We have reduced the hospitals, which operate like a patchwork bundle, to 3 headings as the Ministry of Health, universities and privately. Our citizens can go to whichever of these they want, have their examination, have their analyzes done, and continue their treatment. Of course, private hospitals have to pay a difference fee; However, this figure is determined not in the form of the bills of the old period that set fire to the furnaces, but as a price suitable for the service provided.
Not only did we establish the system, but we also reformed public hospitals in terms of physical structure, equipment and number of personnel. We increased our hospital bed capacity to 240 thousand with an addition of 136 thousand, the number of doctors to 231 thousand with an addition of 94 thousand, and the total number of healthcare workers to 928 thousand with an addition of 550 thousand. We have equipped all our hospitals, from our metropolitan cities to those in the smallest settlements, with the most modern devices required for examinations, analyzes and treatments.
We have written and are writing a success story, especially in the field of emergency health services. We increased the number of ambulances from 618 to 5 thousand, and the number of 112 emergency health stations from 481 to 2668. In addition, by commissioning many emergency health vehicles from planes to helicopters, increasing the number of existing ones, we have put all the services that we used to envy in other countries at the disposal of our citizens. Remember, there were times when patients were pulled by sleds in the Southeast and in the East, but now we have come to transport our patients with those tracked ambulances by bringing tracked ambulances there. Today, from natural disasters to accidents, we are able to stand by our citizens without wasting any time in the most difficult, troublesome and urgent moments when intervention is needed the most.
I see city hospitals as the pinnacle of our reforms in health care. Which of the city hospitals have we opened so far? We put into service 6 city hospitals in Yozgat, Isparta, Mersin, Adana, Kayseri and ElazÄ±Ä. Our hospitals in EskiÅehir and Manisa have started to accept patients, and hopefully we will make their official openings soon. By the way, our city hospital in Bilkent is now finished, and according to the information I just received from the Minister of Health, we will open our city hospital in Bilkent by the end of December, and Ankara will have a giant city hospital in this way.
Of course, our need for trained personnel and health personnel in every field, especially our specialist doctors, together with our city hospitals, is really not possible to leave this aside. Moreover, our health institutions now serve a large number of patients coming from abroad as well as our own citizens. Turkey is a country that goes further every year in health tourism and in providing health services abroad. I believe that we will make a very serious leap in health tourism with these city hospitals. Thankfully, in the field of health, as in every field, we no longer emulate others, they look at us with envy. For this reason, we attach special importance to health education and training, which is still the most popular field of higher education in our country. This is the reason why we established our University of Health Sciences.
Dear friends;
Due to the current state of our country, we need to move our perspective on issues and the nature of our work to a different point. Until yesterday, we were using the information, methods, infrastructures and products that other countries researched, developed and presented to us as ready-made. Today, we have entered a period where we need to carry out all these processes ourselves, and we need to follow the same path in health. In our Ministry, research hospitals, medical faculties, we work with our professors, doctors, students and companies in this direction with the spirit of mobilization. For this reason, if we pay attention recently, we have increased the number of medical faculties and we are increasing them.
Science, of course, is the world; But the outputs and achievements of science are national and local. Turkey also needs a rapid nationalization and localization in the field of health. We must achieve this in every field from the diagnosis of diseases to their treatment, from the discovery of drugs at the molecular level to their clinical studies and production, from the development of medical devices to their manufacture.
Today, both our pharmaceutical and medical device sectors are still largely dependent on foreign sources, and we need to get rid of this. And a significant part of our health expenditures consists of the money paid for drugs and devices imported as products or licenses. Now we want to produce our tomography, ultrasonography, MRI, Turkey can do these, thank God we have this brain power.
Now, we are inviting brand companies from the international community that can enter into joint production in our country and there are positive approaches, we will take these steps in our country. When we develop and produce them ourselves, the burden on our health and social security budget will decrease, the current account deficit will decrease, and we will make significant contributions to our economy through exports.
However, the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is so large and monopolized in the world that it is not easy to break this chain and establish a truly national infrastructure. We have been personally following the studies in these areas for a long time, and we warn all our friends at every opportunity. Despite all this, we still have not been able to deepen the local and national line. I regret to see that the studies of our own scientists, institutions and companies are not given enough support.
Of course, it is not possible to catch up with centuries-old accumulations at once; However, we need to support our scientists and business people who are working sincerely and effectively in this direction, and we are ready to provide this support. This is the requirement of both our responsibility to our nation and the interests of our country. From here, I warn our Ministry, universities and all relevant institutions once again; Our nationalization move in health should be supported without any excuses, excuses, or complexes. I see this issue as critical and important as our defense industry.
Dear Professors,
Dear students;
I believe that Turkey will achieve its goals in the field of health thanks to your efforts, efforts, efforts and skills. Since our ancestors said, ""The state is like a breath of health in the world"", what does this mean? Whether it's a healthy breath or not, this is how important this work is â so we will give more importance to health, which is the source of happiness. In a world where the average human lifespan ranges from the 40s a few centuries ago to the 80s today, it is absolutely unthinkable for us to lag behind the studies in the field of health. We have to do this in order to spend every moment of the life that our Lord has given us in happiness, peace and comfort. The ancients wanted not only a long but also an auspicious life, they wanted a healthy life. The biggest responsibility for the health part of a good life falls first on my teachers and then on you, our students.
In the presidential system of government, we continue to keep education and health at the top of our priorities. Today, the number of people working in each of our country's educational and health institutions is even more than the total number of our Armed Forces and Police Department. This importance given to education and health by a country like Turkey, which is located in the geography where the world's biggest security problems are experienced, is actually a sign of how we look at our future. This understanding forms the basis of our 2023 goals, one of the goals of which is to become one of the 10 largest economies in the world. With our 2053 and 2071 visions, which are our legacy to our youth, I hope we will bring our country to the most advanced level in every field. I expect you, to whom we will entrust the health of our nation and our friends, to firmly protect these visions.
With these feelings, I once again wish the new academic year of our university to be beneficial. I wish success to our teachers and students again. I greet you with love and respect. Stay healthy.

"Their Speech at the Program ""Saplings Grow with Saplings""",2018-11-06,"

Dear managers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of National Education,
Dear guests,
Dear teachers,
Dear students;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection, I kiss your eyes. On behalf of myself and you, I would like to send my greetings to our friends, teachers and students in Samsun, Izmir, ÅanlÄ±urfa and Bursa, with whom we will establish a live connection a little later.
I am very pleased to be with you on the occasion of the Saplings Grow with Saplings project. I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of National Education for pioneering this project, which I find extremely important for our future. Hopefully, with the ceremony we will hold a little later, we are starting a new sapling planting campaign throughout the country with the participation of our students in all primary and secondary schools. Thanks to this project, which was implemented under the coordination of these two ministries, 10 million saplings meet the soil on behalf of our school-age children in all of our 81 provinces; Good luck.
Thus, it is ensured that each of our students has a sapling in their name. These saplings will grow with our children and develop with them. As our children get older, the roots of the saplings will rise to the ground and their height will rise towards the sky. As the dreams of our students today come true over time, I hope the saplings they plant will turn into trees and the trees will turn into forests. Today, the forests, economy and beauties of our country will grow with our children running around in the school gardens and the sparkle of their eyes warms our hearts.
I believe that this project will also instill the awareness of protecting nature and respecting the environment in our children, who are the guarantee of our future. I think that the Saplings Grow with Saplings project will also contribute to our struggle to leave a greener, more beautiful and more peaceful Turkey to our children. I would like to express my gratitude in advance to all our ministries, institutions, teachers and students who will take part in the execution of the project.
Dear friends,
Dear students;
Our world is going through a historical transformation process that started with the industrial revolution and still continues. This period changes and transforms not only the tools we use, but also our entire human and social life. When we look at the last two centuries, we see that there has been a great change in the nature of the relationship that human beings have established with the land, nature, their environment, the society they live in and themselves.
Industrialization and modern technology have given man power over nature as never before and given him the faith to intervene in nature. With modern technology, the so-called insurmountable mountains have been overcome, the deserts that seem impossible to pass have been crossed, and the distances have become closer. This new situation has caused the relationship that modern man has developed with nature to be broken, broken and taken on a new shape.
Nature has lost its personality in the eyes of man and has ceased to be a trust given to him by the Creator to sustain his life. For modern man, nature has come to be perceived either as an enemy to be subjugated or as a private property that must be possessed absolutely. Some Western writers explain this loss of meaning with the phrase ""nature is no longer a temple, but a factory"". However, in ancient societies, nature is man's home, homeland, homeland, and even, according to Ibn Arabi, the mother of man. That's why we call the soil 'mother earth'.
In Islamic thought, nature is a being that has personality and has been entrusted to human beings like everything created by Allah in the universe. From this point of view, nature is the brother of man in creation. The fact that some Muslim thinkers use the term 'aunt of the sons of Adam' when referring to the date palm tree is a symbol of this brotherhood in creation.
On the other hand, we also witness that the Almighty Mawla tells and depicts many things in the Qur'an to people through nature. Our Lord uses the expression 'green' when he tells us about paradise. When describing the beauties of Paradise, Almighty Allah speaks of rivers, streams and springs. In the same way, our Lord explains the importance of the good word with the tree motif by saying, ""A good word is like a beautiful tree whose root is fixed on the ground and whose branches are in the sky, and that tree always bears fruit with the permission of its Lord."" Apart from these, we come across many examples of nature in our holy book.
Dear brothers and sisters;
This change, which has left its mark on the environment and human beings in the last two centuries, unfortunately causes the greatest damage to people, the world and our future. The greed for unlimited consumption and the desire to dominate nature at all costs leave us face to face with huge environmental problems today. While our seas are polluted, our streams, lakes and streams face the threat of drying up. The presence of forests around the world is decreasing day by day. Fertile agricultural lands are being replaced by factories that pollute the air with their chimneys day by day.
Look, the problem of desertification is one of the main reasons that force people to leave their places after conflicts and wars today. Every year, humanity loses more than 10 million hectares of agricultural land and destroys 5 million hectares of forest land, and approximately 1 billion people are unfortunately not adequately nourished for this reason. Far worse, global food production is expected to decline by 12 percent by 2035 due to land misuse. Likewise, the rapid melting of the polar ice caps is seen as a harbinger of environmental problems that threaten all humanity.
Another dimension of the issue is that poor countries in Asia, South America and Africa have to bear the burden of these problems, which are mostly produced by Western rich states. Unfortunately, the poor peoples pay the entire cost of the industrialization moves to which Western societies owe their wealth and prosperity. At the moment, such a growth strategy prevails that the prosperity of one country and one region is unfortunately based on the misery of another country and another region. Especially in the West, while some people live in luxury and pomp, billions of people pay the price of this prosperity with their lives, blood and exploited labor.
While some countries are prospering, Somalia's rivers are drying up, Brazil's rainy environments, and Bangladesh's water resources are being destroyed. While the state, which has no proper underground resources, is getting richer, people living on hundreds of billions of dollars of gold, diamonds and oil and reserves cannot even take bread to their homes. The damage caused to the environment by tankers carrying oil to the yachts and sports cars of the rich in the West is felt the most by African fishermen who seek sustenance for their children with their makeshift boats. The climate, which has changed with the melting of glaciers, primarily affects people living on their own on islands in remote corners of the oceans.
We all have to understand this fact very well: If we do not take precautions, if we do not take steps now, our children will face much bigger problems in the future. If we do not correct our perspective on nature, the environment and life, this world, which is the legacy of our ancestors and the trust of our children, will unfortunately cease to be a livable place. As it is said in that famous Indian saying; ""When all the trees are cut down, when all the animals are hunted, when all the water is polluted, when the air is unbreathable, that's when you'll know that money is not edible."" Yes, it is up to all of us to take the necessary precautions and take the necessary steps without experiencing such a disaster and encountering such a drama.
Dear young people;
I know you're tired. ""Even if you know that the Apocalypse will come, plant even a sapling in your hand as it is today"", this is what our beloved Prophet says. He has left an extremely important legacy to all humanity along with his ummah. With this understanding, we have made great efforts in the last 16 years to strengthen the forest assets of our country and to leave you a greener and more beautiful Turkey. Instead of exploiting the greenery, trees and the environment like those who burned down the streets during the Gezi protests, we sincerely served our country.
We have increased our forest holdings, which were 21 million hectares in 2002, to 22.3 million hectares today. The number of national parks has increased from 32 to 43. The number of nature parks increased from 16 to 243. For the first time in our period, we established honey and urban forests. Today, we have 137 urban forests and 424 honey forests. We have planted 4 billion 70 million saplings in 16 years, and we hope to increase this figure to 7 billion.
We are struggling not only with desertification on earth, but also with desertification in minds. We have increased the number of specially protected areas from 175 to 578. In the 1970s, the amount of soil carried by erosion to seas, lakes and dams was 500 million tons per year, but we have reduced this amount to 154 million tons with the work we have done in the last 16 years. Turkey is the world leader in the fight against erosion and is one of the rare countries that has increased its forest area. Until 2002, an average of 75 million saplings were produced annually. We have been producing an average of 350 million saplings per year for 16 years.
We established the Sapling and Ornamental Plants Exchange in Sapanca, Sakarya, and the Medical and Medicinal Plants Center in Afyonkarahisar. In the last 16 years, we have enabled our forest villagers to earn 15 billion liras in income with our direct support and forestry activities. In order to develop our forest villagers on site, fruit forest trees such as walnut, almond and stone pine are planted in 5 thousand villages with 5 thousand income-generating forest projects. In the last 10 years, we have planted 8.7 million saplings in nearly 49 thousand school gardens. We are increasing this figure even more with the Saplings Grow with Saplings project.
In addition, Turkey is the world leader in the fight against erosion â I repeat â and is one of the few countries that increases its forest area. We have made significant progress in waste management, climate-friendly technology, use of energy resources, and improvement of air, water and soil quality throughout our country. We prioritize renewable energy sources. We know that we cannot reach a greener, cleaner Turkey only by planting saplings and afforestation. For this reason, we also give priority to studies that will prevent environmental pollution, prevent waste, and raise environmental awareness for our people.
With the Zero Waste project carried out under the auspices of our Presidency, we are trying to achieve this throughout our country. Instead of a throwaway culture, we strive to establish a new consumer culture that is compatible with our faith and ancient values. All of us, especially families and educators, have serious responsibilities in order to root an understanding of consumption that is nourished by our civilization values, respectful to nature, sensitive to the environment, and based on opinion instead of waste.
If we want to use resources more efficiently, reduce the amount of waste, recycle waste, and leave a clean world for the future, none of us has the luxury of escaping this responsibility. Every minute, every second that we are late in taking steps in this regard will return to our country as environmental disaster, pollution, disease, famine, poverty and poverty in the future. Personally, I see the Saplings Grow with Saplings Project as a step in the right direction. On the occasion of this beautiful project, I believe that our children will gain environmental awareness and value soil, water, forest and trees more.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I wish success to all my friends, especially our ministers, who will take part in the execution of the project. I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to the struggle for a greener and more beautiful Turkey, and I entrust you all to Allah. Stay healthy.

Dear managers of our Ministry of Industry and Technology and TÃBÄ°TAK,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection.
Today, we have come together on the occasion of the opening of important national technology development infrastructures, the delivery and tests of defense industry projects. I wish that all these national technology development infrastructures, optical systems research laboratory and new generation ammunition delivered to our Turkish Armed Forces will be beneficial for our country. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate all our institutions, teachers, researchers, engineers and technicians who contributed to bringing these projects to our country.
Turkey is rapidly moving towards becoming a country that has a say in all areas of defense, aviation and space technologies. In particular, we are getting really important results in high-resolution observation communication satellites and subsystems, satellite launch systems, satellite data processing, storage and information support systems.
After the satellite we put into service, we stated that we had to design, produce and send more advanced satellites into space. In this context, one of our goals was to produce large-diameter mirrors of satellite cameras in our country. The Optical Systems Research Laboratory, which we have opened, was established within the TÃBÄ°TAK Space Technologies Research Institute for this purpose.
The design, integration and tests of the camera used in the IMECE Satellite Project, which is still being carried out, are carried out by TÃBÄ°TAK. However, the precision optical components used in this camera, such as mirrors, lenses, prisms and filters, were procured from abroad. These parts, which were considered critical technology, had high costs and were subject to export restrictions. Thanks to the OPMER Project, we have made it possible to develop optical components with sensitive technology with our national capabilities. In this way, we ensure that the knowledge of critical designs and the high amounts paid remain in the country.
The activities of the Optical Systems Research Laboratory are not limited to the production of optical components. Likewise, we will carry out the design, measurement, integration and testing activities of the products in this facility. OPMER infrastructure consists of a total of 16 laboratories, including 8 design, 4 production, 1 metrology, and 3 integration tests. In addition to satellite cameras, the facility will also produce sensitive optics and large-diameter mirrors used in telescopes, which are difficult to procure from abroad. OPMER, which is the first center established in this field in our country, is one of the few laboratories in the world that carries out R&D activities on the subject. I wish this important achievement to be especially beneficial for our country.
Dear guests;
We know that one of the reasons behind the intensified attacks against Turkey in recent years is the reaction to the independent policies we have implemented. Again, we know that no matter how independent we are in politics, it depends on the strength of our defense industry. Thankfully, we have come a long way at this point. We have increased the locality-nationality ratio, which was around 20 percent in the defense industry, to 65 percent today. Behind this success, there are infrastructures equipped with advanced technology, such as the facility we have opened, the efforts made, and the skills exhibited. I believe that the period we live in will be engraved in history with golden letters.
But we can't be satisfied with the level we've reached. We can and will reach the goal of an independent and strong Turkey by continuing the national moves we have started in our defense industry without interruption. With this understanding, we will increase the locality-nationality ratio, which is 65 percent in the defense industry. We attach great importance to research and development activities aimed at producing high competitiveness and high value-added technology in the defense industry. TÃBÄ°TAK Defense Industry Research and Development Institute SAGE makes significant contributions to our defense industry with the high-tech weapon systems it has developed.
The Warhead Rail System Dynamite Test Infrastructure HABRAS, which we are opening here today, is one of these contributions. From now on, the effectiveness tests of the nationally developed weapon systems, the convoy acceptance tests of mass-produced ammunition, and the tests of the weapon systems purchased from abroad will be carried out by this organization. With the commissioning of HABRAS, our defense industry has gained an important capability and infrastructure that a limited number of countries such as America, England, France, Germany, Russia and China have. With HABRAS, which was completed in a very short time with national resources and compared to its peers, Turkey is becoming a country that can provide this service abroad as well as conducting its own tests. I wish this critical system to be beneficial to our country and our defense industry. Now, we are connecting to Konya KarapÄ±nar via live broadcast for the first test activity of the Warhead Rail System Dynamic Test Infrastructure HABRAS.
(A live video connection was made and the execution of the test was carried out successfully.)
Dear guests;
Today, our defense industry sector has turned into a national structure with the participation of more than a thousand companies, SMEs, research institutions and universities. One of the products of this national structure and unity is the PULAT active protection system.
PULAT is a system developed in partnership with TÃBÄ°TAK SAGE and ASELSAN, which protects the tank it is integrated into against the threats it will be exposed to in the field with the static counter-resistance technique. The destruction system consisting of a warhead and firing unit developed by SAGE is a very critical technology in PULAT, whose qualification and integration studies are ongoing. This system has been developed in such a way that the threat is neutralized by air before it reaches the tank. With this technology, our tank units, which are the most important combat force of our Armed Forces, have gained a truly vital technology. I wish good luck to our country and our army. Now we will follow the effectiveness test of the PULAT destruction system together.
(A live video connection was made and the execution of the test was carried out successfully.)
Dear guests;
Another unique product of our defense industry and domestic technology studies is the development of a high-power laser system, or IÅIN project, carried out by TÃBÄ°KAT BÄ°LGEM. Within the scope of the IÅIN project, our laser and laser systems, which were produced with domestic facilities, achieved superior success on targets with a high accuracy rate. Our laser weapons, which work with electrical energy without ammunition and have low firing costs, were designed, produced and brought to the testing stage by our own engineers. In the first prototype, the lasers procured from abroad were nationalized within the scope of the project. Our country has become one of the countries that make lasers over kilowatts suitable for defense applications. The system, which achieved high success in the first trials, will be used in aircraft and ships in the coming period. Now we are connecting to KÄ±rÄ±kkale for the test of the beam project, which is a proud work, and we will carry out the first test activity on the live broadcast. Good luck to our country and our nation.
(A live video connection was made and the execution of the test was carried out successfully.)
Dear guests;
Today, the meaning of the concept of security has changed drastically. Now, physical security needs to be fortified with cyber security, digital industry, domestic software and artificial intelligence. Our technological depth in the fields of nanotechnology, materials, aviation, space and defense is increasing day by day. Therefore, our self-confidence is also increasing in the international defense community. Today, we are launching the electromagnetic launch system, or SAPAN, which is one of the products that have reached these technological depths.
This is an offensive system, we are watching it now. With SAPAN, we will be able to reach hypersonic speeds of 6 times and above, which are risky to reach with chemical fuels with very high costs.Â  A munition moving at hypersonic speeds is very difficult to both track and destroy. That is why such munitions are critical in the destruction of critical targets. Studies continue all over the world for the design and safe operation of systems similar to SAPAN. We have succeeded in producing this critical technology in our country. Within the scope of the project, we aim to launch one kilogram of ammunition at speeds starting from 2 thousand meters per second.
Dear friends;
The domestic technologies we have developed in the defense industry have performed extremely important tasks in our recent terrorist operations. We effectively use our domestic defense industry vehicles in operations both within and outside our borders.
Operation Olive Branch is one of the most striking examples of this. Praise be to God, we have carried out a very successful operation with our own products without needing anyone. Today, we are determined to further increase the technical capabilities and capabilities of our Turkish Armed Forces, which have carried out successful operations. Today, we will deliver some of the ammunition we have developed to the Turkish Armed Forces.
The precision guidance kit 82, designed by TÃBÄ°TAK SAGE to provide guidance capability to general purpose bombs, has entered the inventory of our Air Force Command. With this kit, which has been certified on the F-4 and F-16 platforms, which turn standard bombs into smart bombs, and can be used in all weather conditions, the operational capability of our Air Force has been carried even further. The subsystems and parts of the precision guidance kit, the first batch of which has been delivered and production activities are ongoing, are produced domestically by various defense industry organizations. This system, which will be used in conjunction with a multi-shot adapter in the near future, will thus allow more targets to be neutralized with fewer aircraft. We also added the winged guidance kit, penetrating bomb and SOM, medium-range munitions launched on the surface, developed by TÃBTÄ°AK, to the inventory of the Turkish Armed Forces.
Now, I would like to share a very important good news with my nation; The need for a long-range regional air missile defense system is raised on different occasions. On the other hand, the importance of this system for the security of our country is obvious. Today, we are taking the first step of a project that will take Turkey to a different league in this field over time. Work on the creation of a national long-range regional air missile defense system was initiated by TÃBÄ°TAK SAGE, ASELSAN and ROKETSAN under the leadership of our Presidency of Defense Industries. The first deliveries are scheduled for the end of 2021.
Today, we are also announcing the name of this project of historical importance; I wish that the national long-range regional air missile defense system, which we started under the name of SÄ°PER, will be beneficial. Of course, since it is a defense system, we named it SÄ°PER. Â I would like to emphasize that I expect the highest level of effort from all relevant institutions for the timely delivery of the project.
Dear guests;
In today's world, we need to develop our domestic technology in all areas in order to establish independence on solid foundations, domestic and national... Just like in the defense industry, we have no other way out than to reach the position of a country that is self-sufficient in every field, designing, developing, producing and exporting technology. That's why we call it a national technology move. It is possible for us to reach stronger points in the economy and world politics than today with the moves we will make in national technology.
They made us wait at their doors for a long time, so much so that they said, 'Go today and come back tomorrow', and finally they said, 'There was no permission from the congress'. But thanks to them, they made us the owners right now, and thanks to them, we also produced the unmanned aerial vehicle, we also produced our UCAVs, now we are going further, I hope that we will produce it towards the middle of 2019, I will not reveal its name now.
Our Ministry of Industry and Technology has a great job in the works that need to be carried out in our industry. Hopefully, a young team will have this and we will continue to increase these productions day by day. The support programs carried out by TÃBÄ°TAK and the technological projects it develops are also of vital importance in this respect.
As in the studies carried out here today, we aim to increase the competitiveness of our country on a global scale by contributing to the development of defense and space technologies. In all these actions, there are the signatures of our scientists, researchers, and the unsung heroes of the defense industry sector. Therefore, we must firmly protect our values and create a suitable climate for them to serve our country. For this reason, we encourage the return of our scientists and experts to their country with various programs in order to contribute to projects that have strategic value for our country.
Likewise, we consider the encouragement of our small and medium-level companies operating in the field of defense industry, as well as our entrepreneurs and engineers who embrace their work with enthusiasm, as important. We are also saddened to receive reports that some of our institutions are still not doing enough support for such activities. From here, I make it clear once again; If there are works of our own private sector organizations in a project, they should definitely be preferred and supported. If the current work is found to be insufficient, the necessary opportunities should be given to develop and take it forward. I would also like it to be known that I will closely follow our institutions and bureaucrats who insistently demand products of foreign origin on critical and urgent issues in terms of our national security.
We are all excited about the moments we have just experienced. Repeating this excitement with actions and inventions in every field will really increase our excitement for us and we are looking forward to it.
I wish that the ammunition delivered to our Armed Forces, the facilities opened and the projects implemented will be beneficial to our country. I would like to congratulate all our institutions, organizations and companies, especially our Ministry of Industry and Technology, who took part in these projects, worked and contributed. I offer you my love and respect. Stay healthy.
"
Their Speech at the AK Party Group Meeting,2018-10-30,"

Dear people,
Dear Members of Parliament,
Dear guests;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to my Lord that our group meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country.
Last week, right after our group meeting, we attended the Introductory Meeting of the 2023 Vision Document of our Ministry of National Education. In this meeting, we stated that Turkey had problems in the past due to the fact that education was seen as a mechanism that formats people rather than developing them. We said that while we seek to make our children have a diploma by filling their minds with knowledge, we neglect to feed their hearts. We reiterated once again that we cannot overcome this job without providing education and training, education and training together.
We stated that we found it appropriate that the 2023 Education Vision of our Ministry, which consists of strategic goals listed under 18 headings, starts from people. In the coming period, we are determined to implement a system based on education and discipline that learns from past mistakes and will meet our future needs.
On Wednesday, at an international symposium organized by the Council of State, we shared our views on our judicial system from past to present with the public. In particular, we have personally expressed to the interlocutors of the issue the troublesome situation that has arisen in the judiciary with the decision of our oath, which we do not find innocent at all.
On Friday, we met with our organization at our Expanded Provincial Presidents Meeting. As you know, we have held consultations with our district presidents before. Preparations at our headquarters are also continuing. The Supreme Election Council also began to create the calendar gradually. Hopefully, we will soon start to take our steps regarding the March 31, 2019 elections. On Friday evening, we attended the graduation ceremony of the Gendarmerie and Coast Guard Academy and sent off a total of 3351 non-commissioned officers, 3253 of whom were Gendarmerie General Command and 98 Coast Guard Command personnel.
On Saturday, we hosted a historic summit in Istanbul. At this summit, which was held with the participation of the Presidents of Turkey, Russia and France and the German Chancellor, we discussed the place reached in the Syrian issue and the steps to be taken. In the bilateral meetings with the leaders participating in the summit, we mainly discussed the issue of Jamal Khashoggi and there were questions they asked, but I also had the opportunity to express to them many issues that they did not know until now. After the summit meeting, which we all attended, we both issued a statement and expressed our views at the press conference.
On Monday, yesterday, we experienced two historic moments together. I believe that we are truly celebrating the 95th anniversary of our Republic with the inauguration of a work worthy of our Republic.
Dear friends;
I would like to take this opportunity to once again congratulate our nation on the Republic Day. I commemorate with respect all our veterans, martyrs and statesmen who have been fighting for these lands to become our homeland and to continue in this way since Manzikert. I would like to express our gratitude to all our heroes who are still working day and night for the survival of our country and nation, struggling and sacrificing their lives when necessary. I wish success to all our security forces who perform their duties with a heart full of love for the country, regardless of where they are inside or outside our borders.
After the morning parts of the Republic Day ceremonies were held in Ankara, we went to Istanbul and attended a historical ceremony. Yesterday, we officially opened our Istanbul Airport, one of the largest in the world. As you can see, we celebrate our Republic not with words but with deeds. And it is such a celebration that it is not a one-day celebration, I hope this celebration will continue for years to come. On every flight, at every landing, it will be said that 'this place was opened on October 29, 95th anniversary'.
We also held the Republic Day reception, which we give every year, at our new airport. Of course, there were those who did not come by using this as an excuse, that is another matter. ""Such receptions of the Republic Day were celebrated only in Ankara""; What kind of understanding is this? As long as you put your heart into this business. But it's easy to find excuses when you don't have the heart...
This airport, which is one of the biggest investments in the history of our Republic; I wish good luck to our country, our nation, our region and the whole world once again. Because this airport of ours will now be one of the most important airports in the world. Hopefully, this is almost a center and there will be distributions from here to the world.
9 presidents, 2 prime ministers, 1 speaker of parliament, 3 deputy prime ministers, 35 ministers and representatives of 8 international organizations from friendly and brotherly countries attended the opening ceremony and shared this happy day with us. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to them. With this giant work, which we named Istanbul Airport, Turkey has not only strengthened its position as a transit center, but has also risen to the top league in air transportation and logistics.
As you know, the status of our AtatÃ¼rk Airport in YeÅilkÃ¶y will continue with the same name. I believe that we have taken a step in line with our goals for 2023 and beyond by using the name of Istanbul, the most important brand of our country, in its simplest form at our new airport.
The tender for this airport was made in 2013 and its construction started in May 2015. Dear brothers and sisters, pay attention, this place is over in 42 months. This is what suits us, this is what suits the AK Party government. Here Berlin laid the foundation stone in 2006, Berlin airport is still in progress. And now the Germans are saying from their own newspapers, 'Istanbul Airport, which is 3 times or 4 times bigger than here, is finished, what is the state of Berlin?' This, of course, shows one thing; What? Faith is such a thing that it makes milk out even of a goat. We believed, we persevered, praise be to God, those who said 'there is no airport here' saw that this airport exists. And my dear brothers and sisters, those who make excuses such as 'this is soft ground, there is no airport here', yes, they have seen and will see what the airport is like.
Now, yesterday, we have implemented two runways, the construction of other runways continues, and I hope we will be able to increase this airport, the first phase of which has a capacity of 90 million passengers, to 150 million, and even up to 200 million depending on the need. The airport is established on an area of 76.5 million square meters. It started with two tracks at the moment, soon the number of tracks will increase to 3, and when all stages are completed, the number of tracks will increase to 6. Our airport is truly proud of its 2 million square meters of indoor area, 6.5 million square meters of apron size, rail system, terminals, indoor and outdoor car parks, support units, social facilities and other units. Our airport, which is equipped with the latest technology in every field, produces its own energy, is an environmentalist, nature-friendly and barrier-free project, will also be instrumental in employing 120 thousand people, and this figure will increase to 225 thousand people in the following years.
The total investment cost of the airport is 10 billion 247 million Euros. Do you know what is the rent to be paid to the state during the contract? It is 22 billion 152 million euros. Our airport has brought a total economic size of 32.4 billion Euros, excluding taxes, to our country in these two items in a single project, in a single item. This is Turkey, this is the AK Party government, this is how we did it, this is how we have come to this day. But do the leaders of the main opposition have such a problem, such an understanding, such a logic? No. First of all, they don't understand such a budget logic, such diversification of incomes, diversification of investments, such things, they just throw blanks, we do not have this.
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank our institutions that contributed to all stages of this giant work, these companies with 5 partners, especially all the workers from the architect to the engineer who contributed here. And of course, there is a consortium of 5 here; Cengiz Holding, Limak, Kalyon, Kolin and MNG as the fifth company. And these 5 companies really joined hands here, they stood shoulder to shoulder, they did not give that opportunity to those who said ""what if"", they finished this job.
Dear friends; In order to coincide with our Republic Day, we really pushed and encouraged the contractor companies. Thanks to them, they worked day and night to officially open our airport on October 29, Republic Day. Symbolic flights on domestic and international routes will start immediately, but the process of moving Ataturk Airport here will continue until New Year's Eve. Therefore, our airport will hopefully be operational at full capacity in a few months.
For us, October 29 is an important day that must be remembered in accordance with its meaning, like our other national holidays. As you know, there is a segment of people in our country who have been trying to monopolize Gazi Mustafa Kemal, our Republic Day and Victory Day, as well as many common values of our nation for years.
It is not the case that this segment has benefited the Republic, our nation or our country in the slightest, nor has the slightest service passed. On the contrary, they opposed all of the steps taken for the good of the country and the nation, and tried to prevent all of them. We call them 'salon Republicans' and 'wardrobe Republicans'. For years, this head, which has been trying to protect its secret power by distancing the Republic and the Republic, and the veteran AtatÃ¼rk, has always humiliated our nation with their words and actions.
They wanted to detach our nation from its history, civilization and culture and condemn it to a Westernism without identity, without personality, consisting only of form. This is the reason why they are dealing with all the values of our nation, from the call to prayer to the headscarf. Behind the 1960 coup, the 1980 coup, the February 28 struggle and other similar attempts, there is always this repressive, dictatorial, yes, Jacobin head. The CHP is the most important representative of this mentality in politics. This segment has had serious weight and influence in the bureaucracy, business world and non-governmental organizations for a long time.
Didn't they remove Ataturk's name and picture from stamps, didn't they remove it from Turkish money? Didn't they remove their tables from the classrooms? That's what they were. Who did they put in their place? They put Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼. We have to tell them all this, why? This younger generation does not know this, but Mr. Kemal does. Come on, where are you going to put this, Mr. Kemal, let's explain. On the one hand, you will say 'I am an AtatÃ¼rkist', and on the other hand, you were the one who removed all the paintings of AtatÃ¼rk from stamps, money, classrooms and government offices. We know these things, we will tell them. Everyone needs to know the dirty face of the CHP, everyone needs to know its real face. They will know that this younger generation should not swallow this. After that, let them also be held accountable. This step is very important for him. If they had acted as much as they abused the concept of the republic, Turkey would probably be in a completely different place today.
Those who stopped the move that Turkey started in the 1950s in 1960 and squandered the opportunities that came their way in the 1990s with the February 28 mentality have been dealing with us for 17 years. The July 15 coup attempt is no different from other coups in our country in terms of its purpose and the forces behind it. It was only done by methods that were more insidious and despicable than them. Thankfully, with the support of our nation, we did not leave the square to these incompetents.
We see that this mentality criticizes the fact that we opened our Istanbul Airport on October 29 and that we are holding the Republic Day Reception at the airport on this occasion. Oh, poor people. Dude, you do it wherever you do it... In the same way, they dare to question our membership in our country and nation through the debate on our oath.
Of course, the republic of work, the republic of service, which we have made a witness to with our 2023 goals, is very alien to these hall republicans. So much so that they take all the materials used by the circles that are in competition with Turkey in our region, and they repeat the same allegations against us. Supposedly, they think that they will sow discord between us and our nation by stirring up the oath issue, which is a debate that is now behind us. In 2015, this work came out. Where have you been since 2015?
However, in doing so, they put themselves in really ridiculous, even tragicomic situations. For example, in recent days, I have seen big men wearing black aprons and taking to the streets, it was very strange. When I said I was going to read the text of the oath, I witnessed people who were ridiculous and disgraced in front of the children.
From here, I repeat once again; The measure of our republicanism is the services we have rendered to this country and nation, the works we have achieved. The measure of our respect for AtatÃ¼rk is that he was the Commander-in-Chief of our War of Independence and the founder of our new state, which we see as a breath of fresh air in historical continuity. The measure of our Turkishness is not a text from the one-party era, but our place in the hearts of our nation. We are the ones who revived all those ruined places in Mongolia. As we said before; Our only oath is our National Anthem, we do not compromise on this.
Like every historical process, there may be right, wrong, less or more in the first period of our Republic. It is one thing to account for them in order to achieve better, more beautiful, it is another thing to be blindly subject or blindly hostile. We have not deviated from these two mistakes, and we will not deviate. We will do whatever it takes to serve Turkey and the Turkish nation, and we will follow that path.
Dear friends;
The Syrian issue remains of critical importance for the near future of our country. Without resolving this issue, we cannot look to our future with confidence. Ensuring stability, security and peace in Syria, which has become a rehearsal ground for centuries-old intentions towards our country, is a requirement of our loyalty to our brothers and sisters as well as our own interests.
There is not the slightest doubt about Turkey's respect for the territorial integrity of Syria, the right of the Syrian people to govern themselves and determine their own future. With this understanding, we have hoped for a very long time that the crisis in Syria would be resolved with the dynamics of the country itself.
However, for a while, we saw that everyone who had plans and ambitions about our region and even our country had their hands in Syria. Not only that, but terrorist organizations beyond our borders have started attacks on the territory of our country. It would probably not have been thought that we would have to wait with our hands tied in the face of these terrorist acts, some of which continue in the form of harassment on our border line and some in the form of suicide bomb attacks in our big cities. As a matter of fact, one of the aims of the July 15 coup attempt was to make Turkey passive in the face of this great project carried out through Syria and Iraq.
From this point on, we see that there is no alternative left for us but to take steps that will ensure an environment of security and peace in Syria. We successfully carried out Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch Operations. With these operations, we have dealt great blows to the two bloody terrorist organizations of the region, DAESH and PYD. The care we showed both in the execution and after these operations and the favor of the people of the region towards our country negated the accusations that had been circulating for a long time about Turkey's intentions.
Both the international community and our Arab brothers understood very well the purpose for which our country went there. Finally, we have proven once again that we are truly on the side of the Syrian people by preventing a major humanitarian crisis in Idlib. We have carried out all these processes largely together with Russia. With the quadripartite summit we held in Istanbul, we have taken an important step towards expanding this ground of reconciliation.
As I stated in the press conference we held after the summit, the fact that the international community did not take care of the issue has played a very important role in the transformation of the Syrian crisis into such a tragic situation. With this summit, we are taking the steps we have taken in Geneva and Astana to a different ground. Hopefully, from now on, we will ensure that the international community takes a stronger stance on the Syrian issue.
On the other hand, we know that DAESH is trying to be revived by certain groups through its retrained and spread elements throughout the region. A focus that uses all terrorist organizations indiscriminately as a lever to achieve its goals in the region is now trying to stage this disgusting game again. We believe that neither the people of the region nor the world public opinion will swallow this DAESH game.
We will never allow those who want to drown Idlib and then all of Syria in blood and fire again by provoking the regime on the one hand and raising the specter of DAESH on the other. Not only that, but we will also destroy the terrorist structure in the east of the Euphrates. We have completed our preparations, plans and programs on this issue. In fact, we have recently started our actual interventions against the terrorist organization. Soon we will be on top of the terrorist organization with more comprehensive and effective operations. As I always say, we can come suddenly one night. By clearing the terrorist structures in the north of Iraq one by one, we are removing this region from being a base for attacks against our country.
Look, we had two martyrs here at the last moment. What? They froze to death. This morning, our Minister of Interior explained all the details of this issue at a press conference. They didn't have clothes, they didn't have this, they didn't have that, and so on, Mr. Kemal is trying to make a profit from them. Mr. Kemal, let me tell you something, my grandfather was martyred in SarÄ±kamÄ±Å wrapped in his rifle and frozen. There is also walking to witness with a bullet in witness, and there is walking to witness by freezing. Dresses and such, don't tell us about them.
At the moment, all the equipment of our soldiers at this point, from their clothes to sleeping bags, to their food, to their clothes, to their boots, are all materials in the most modern armies in the world, and our soldiers are wearing them right now. What are you talking about without knowing? I mean, why are you trying to deceive the people so that you can get a few votes from here? Dude, be honest, be honest. You have no right to belittle this country, this state. But you don't have an understanding of witness, you don't have such a problem.
Look, what do the families of these martyrs think, what do you think? They all believed in this testimony, and therefore they know it at this point. But you don't have that. That's why 'what do I get out of this'; You won't be able to get anything together, you're already done, you're gone, you're leaving, you won't be able to do anything. But be honest, at least don't try to make a profit on our martyrs. You are the man who escaped under the shadow of the tanks on the night of July 15 and took refuge in BakÄ±rkÃ¶y Municipality. We know your character now. Because this is all a matter of ignorance, we know you well and this nation knows you better every day. Hopefully, March 31 will be the end of this march, the CHP will be saved, and the nation will get rid of you.
Turkey's principled stance against terrorist organizations is being appreciated more and more every day. And thanks to our soldiers, gendarmerie, police and security guards, we continue on this path and we will get even stronger. Hopefully, the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism will increase even more. We are now in a position to carry out our operations not in spite of everyone, but with the support of many countries and societies. As His Holiness Ä°brahim HakkÄ± of Erzurum said; ""The evil of the truth is hayreyler / Don't think that the goals are / Arif watches the moment / Mevla, let's see what they are, / Whatever they are, they are good things."" Yes, we surrender to God, we trust our people, the rest is just a matter of time and ground.
Dear friends;
In the local elections, we will once again appear before our nation, present our report card, and request their support for what we will do. As a party that draws its strength only from the support of our nation, the AK Party has to come out of the March 31, 2019 elections with the highest possible vote rate.
In the past, we have repeatedly witnessed how those who seem to be sitting in their own corner, even in the slightest atmosphere of uncertainty, take out their claws and prepare to attack us. We have never forgotten and will never forget the delusions of those who are burning with the ambition of political revenge at home and the eagerness to bring our country to its knees abroad.
For this reason, neither Turkey nor the AK Party has the right to stop or hesitate, let alone regress. All our friends who will prepare for the local elections should approach the issue with this awareness. We should act with the awareness that the issue is not only the AK Party, not only this municipality and this duty, but also the great and strong love of Turkey, and we should embrace the elections with all hands.
As I repeat at every opportunity, if we cannot enter the hearts of our people, it does not matter what comes out of the ballot box. A politician who is no longer in touch with his nation is like a leaf that has broken off from its branch in autumn, and wherever it is tossed, its fate is to rot away.
We need candidates who are integrated with the people where they live, who are troubled by their problems, who rejoice in their joy, who have a love of service in their hearts and projects in their minds, not looking for a reward on the backs of the AK Party. Whether he aspires to the office again or appears before the nation for the first time, every AK Party candidate should have this profile. If we strictly adhere to these measures, we will be able to complete the elections in March 2019 with a new record, God willing.
If we do not comply with our principles regarding candidates and the election campaign, we have no right to complain about the result. We will strive to do what is right, best and best for our country and our party. Look, it's not that much time; We will start working hard now. Day and night, the main level, women's branches, youth branches, all together... Remember, we say no to intention and no to fate. May God help us.
With these feelings, I once again wish you success in the work of the Assembly. I offer my love and respect to all of you. Stay healthy.

Dear young people,
Dear Diyarbekirians,
Dear brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to God that the DiyarbakÄ±r Youth Festival, which started on Thursday and will end tomorrow, will be beneficial for our city, region and country. I would like to congratulate our ministries, institutions, DiyarbakÄ±r Governorship, DiyarbakÄ±r Metropolitan Municipality and Archers Foundation who contributed to the organization of this festival.
I see it as a meaningful choice that the Youth Festival, which was held in Istanbul in May, will be repeated in DiyarbakÄ±r in October. I believe that this festival, which includes art, culture, sports, entertainment and many other events, will be the symbol of the developing and changing face of DiyarbakÄ±r.
Our love and affection for DiyarbakÄ±r is not just words. We are not working to exploit DiyarbakÄ±r, but to rebuild, develop, elevate, bring peace and prosperity to it. We are coming to DiyarbakÄ±r for the third time this year and embracing you. If I could, I would like to come to DiyarbakÄ±r every month, to be in DiyarbakÄ±r, to be together with you, my big-hearted, beautiful volunteer brothers. But rest assured, we follow every issue of DiyarbakÄ±r and look for a way to make every job easy. Especially when it comes to the youth of Diyarbakir, we consider it our duty to do whatever we can.
We feel that being here today with our young people adds strength to our strength, energizes our energy, and sharpens our determination to fight. Because today we see the descendants of Saladin Ayyubi in front of us. Because here today we see the sons of Fatih who will walk with his nation on the day he receives a sign from his ancestor. Because we see AsÄ±m's generation here today. Because here today, we see a youth who is aware of 'time belongs to me and space is entrusted to me'.
This youth is the future of DiyarbakÄ±r and our country, the city of prophets, companions, many great states, culture and art people. This is the generation that will bring our visions of 2053 and 2071 to life. This youth is our hope, our hope, our everything.
Youths;
Are all the young people of DiyarbakÄ±r and our 80 provinces ready to assume this great responsibility? For this, are we ready to train ourselves in the best way in every field? Are we ready to carry our soul forward by protecting our values, our body by not neglecting sports, and our vision with education? Are we ready to fight for one nation, one flag, one homeland, one state? Are we ready to show the day to those who want to lower our flag, silence our call to prayer, take away our independence, and darken our future? Are we ready to move on by embracing all 81 million people and all 81 provinces of this country? Mashallah. As long as this youth is with us, there is no goal that we cannot reach, there is no struggle that we cannot win.
Brothers;
The foundation and future of a country is at the tip of the pen with a sword. Your sword will be sharp so that you do not give an opportunity to those who covet your homeland and our freedom. Your pen will be strong so that you can prepare your generations for the future through education. Today, Turkey is trying to defend itself and build the future. Thankfully, we have come a long way in both areas.
A few years ago, they wanted to bury the future of our country and our nation by digging holes in some neighborhoods in some of our cities, especially in the center of Diyarbakir. So we erected these monuments. They dug holes, and we erected these monuments. Because the people of Diyarbakir saw this betrayal, they stood by their state and frustrated the terrorists. We witnessed the same scenes in our other cities. What they could not achieve within our borders, they tried to do outside, and we did not allow them. There is no perfection with a bad thing. This people cannot be served by acting as a tool of those who have nefarious ambitions on our region.
Be careful, regardless of the name and claim, the end of the rope of all terrorist organizations leads to the same place. There is no difference between FETÃ members who sell their selves to charlatans in America for $1 and DAESH members who slaughter Muslims in the name of Islam and separatist terrorists who shoot bullets at their own people and their own country. The silhouette behind those who oppose this country by abusing the values of our great religion and those who declare war on this nation by abusing the name of our Kurdish brothers and sisters is the same.
Our 81 million citizens in this country, whether they are Turks, Kurds, Laz, Circassians, Roma, Abkhazians, Assyrians, Arabs, Balkan or Caucasian immigrants, have only one state, and that is the Republic of Turkey. We will protect our state. We will protect our unity, solidarity and brotherhood. Those who seek another identity for themselves, who seek another state for themselves, are condemned to lose their home, their homeland, their family and their honor, as we have seen many examples in recent history.
Turkey did not fall into this trap with the joint efforts of our people from all walks of life, especially our brothers and sisters from Diyarbakir, but broke the game and protected its will. Today, the only concern of those who still speak the language of separatism rather than unity, solidarity and brotherhood is the fear of losing their political and economic rent.
We offered our nation to be divided, not divided. We offered our nation to grow, not to disintegrate. We offered our nation fraternity, not discrimination. We offered prosperity to our nation, not misery. We offered our nation trust, not fear. Since our nation has responded positively to this proposal, today there is a Turkey that stands tall in all respects.
Whoever comes to you with division, fragmentation, discrimination, misery and fear, know that he is your worst enemy. When you look behind the one who comes with this offer, all you will see will be our sworn enemies. Those who could not defeat Saladin Ayyubi and Sultan KÄ±lÄ±Ã§arslan yesterday have their eyes fixed on you today. There is no limit to lies, slander, promises and hypocrisy in their mashrab and in their mashrab. Notice that you can find the same adjectives in some politicians in our country. Because they are the shadow of their originals. Unlike in the past, we have been successful because we have struggled with the originals, not their shadows.
Brothers and sisters, dear young people;
The obstacles we encounter at every step we take remind us of a fact over and over again. Especially when we look back at the last 5 years, we see this better. For example, the aim of Gezi was not trees, the problem on December 17-25 was not the law, and the intention was not right in the pit protests. Justice was not the goal in Syria. It was not the country that was observed on July 15. In the last economic fluctuation, the fact of the matter was not the exchange rate. Thankfully, our nation sees these facts.
DiyarbakÄ±r has always supported us in this process. Despite this, the election results indicate that there are still some doubts in minds. From here, I call out to all of DiyarbakÄ±r and my brothers and sisters who have the same hesitations: Those who discriminate against ethnicity in this country will find us first. In this region, those who discriminate against the region and discriminate against the city will find us first. In this region, anyone who discriminates against anyone because of their belief, language or culture will find us first.
Whatever problems, problems or expectations DiyarbakÄ±r has, we will solve it together, just like in the other 80 provinces of our country. On the way here from the airport, you saw the state of these streets, right? How do you see it all around, it's sparkling. Everywhere is completely different with the buildings erected. Whatever is in the West, it is here. Are you ready for this?
We will be one, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey together. This is the formula for our bright future. Now all the other paths lead to suffering, to tears, to persecution, to the darkening of our future. Remember, a Muslim cannot be bitten twice in the same hole. We have tried every way in this geography for 200 years, and at the point we have reached today, we see that no method other than protecting our unity, solidarity and brotherhood is in our favor.
DiyarbakÄ±r is a city that has always been a pioneer, a leader and a pioneer throughout its history. Let's give the good news of the new era from DiyarbakÄ±r again: O Diyarbekir; Are you ready to put an end to the era of those who have given you nothing but pain, blood and tears? Are you ready to close the era of those who have no promise to you but persecution, oppression and fear? Are we ready to put a stop to those who kidnap their children, their private homes, their daughters, and those who kidnap them to Qandil? Are you ready to stand by those who bring you all kinds of services, from education to health, from transportation to energy?
So, let's open the doors of a new era in March 2019. Let's put forward the will that will carry our country to 2023 together. Let's build a peaceful and prosperous future for our children together. Let's all stand together for a strong and great Turkey. While this voice rising from DiyarbakÄ±r refreshes the hearts of our friends, it also narrows the hearts of our enemies. Remember, the louder we raise this voice, the more determined we will be to achieve our goals.
Now let's get up and sing our song together. Are we ready? Â We walked together on these roads, we got wet together in the pouring rain. In all the songs I listen to now, everything reminds me of you, everything reminds me of Turkey.
Good luck with our day. Let the football match we will watch a little later be an example for our young people. I say stay healthy.

Dear Members of Parliament,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I pray to my Lord that our Group Meeting will be beneficial for our party and our country.
The previous weekend, we held a comprehensive consultation meeting with our deputies, founders and Headquarters Management in KÄ±zÄ±lcahamam. We held this meeting with almost 1500 people, including the families and companions of the participants. Our Headquarters Managers and Ministers informed all the participants with their presentations on their areas of responsibility. All of our friends contributed to this consultation with their questions and evaluations. After the meeting, we embraced and hasbih our people in KÄ±zÄ±lcahamam on the occasion of a mass opening ceremony in KÄ±zÄ±lcahamam district center.
Then we went to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, on Monday. We had very productive contacts with the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of Parliament and other officials of Hungary in this beautiful city on the banks of the Danube, where every inch of land smells of history. On Tuesday, at the meeting of the Hungarian counterparts with the delegation of businessmen accompanying us, we evaluated the opportunities for economic cooperation between our countries. We recited our Fatiha together at the GÃ¼lbaba Tomb and the Galician Turkish Martyrdom. We remembered our ancestors with our blessings.
On Wednesday, we met with our friends from Africa on the occasion of the Turkey-Africa Economic and Business Forum, which was held for the second time in Istanbul. I see that we have started to reap the fruits of Turkey's opening policy in Africa, which is based on mutual respect, love and gain. It is said and thought that Africa will leave its mark on the third millennium in the world. We are also looking for close cooperation and solidarity opportunities with our African brothers and sisters in the political, social and economic fields. Together, we will build the bright future of this continent, which has suffered greatly in the past.
On Thursday, we held a Defense Industry Executive Committee Meeting where we discussed very important projects. We will also continue to personally follow the defense industry projects that are of vital importance for our country. On Friday, we longed for our brothers and sisters from Isparta. First, we attended the badge ceremony of our commando specialist sergeants, which is around 4080 in number, and then we attended the mass opening ceremony in the city center.
On Saturday, we held a full program in Kayseri. We met with our citizens from Kayseri at the opening ceremony, and then with our professors and students at the opening of the academic year at Erciyes University. On Sunday, I wanted to see the last point of our mosque, which was built on ÃamlÄ±ca Hill, which I believe will be one of the monumental works of our country, and we examined it. I am very pleased to see that this work, which I have visited many times before, is now at the stage of completion.
Yesterday, all of our district presidents are standing in front of me now, as you know, for the first time, we held a meeting in our party with all the district presidents in two parties. We held the first group on October 2 and the second group yesterday. And so, God willing, we will make this a tradition and we will continue the event not only on the basis of provincial presidents but also on the basis of district presidents by meeting with our district presidents every year like this. After our meeting yesterday, we met with our muftis and deans of the faculty of theology.
We are here with you today. After our meeting, we will hopefully attend the drawing ceremony of our new judges and prosecutors. In the evening, we will hold our Central Executive Board meeting at our Headquarters.
Tomorrow we are going to Moldova for an official visit that will last two days. On Friday, together with my brother Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, we will attend the opening ceremony of the Star Refinery in Izmir, followed by the opening ceremony of the academic year of one of our universities.
As you can see, we are trying to make use of every day, every hour and every minute on the way to serve our country and nation. Don't stop, keep going. As we serve our nation, our strength increases and our energy increases. This is the secret of the AK Party's failure to come down from the top for so many years. As we work, my Lord gives His blessing. As we run, my Lord paves our way. As we strive, my Lord makes the difficult easy. I expect the same effort and effort from each of my friends.
There is no place for fatigue, discouragement, laziness and inertia in our book. If anyone does not see a cure for themselves to walk on this path of service and to continue this great struggle, he should know that he is in the wrong place. We do not approve of early retirement in our social security system, but in politics it is always open.
Dear friends;
While we're on the subject of retirement, I'd like to share with you my views on the early retirement debate. As it is known, in order to retire according to the social security legislation in our country, three different issues should be considered: insurance period, number of premium payment days and age. Until 1999, only the length of service and the number of days of contribution payment were sufficient for retirement. With a regulation made on this date, the age requirement was gradually introduced. This is the essence of the recent campaign under the heading of those who are stuck with age in retirement.
In fact, an association has been established under this title. The situation of the head of this association alone is the biggest proof of what kind of disaster our social security system is trying to push. The lady at the head of this association was included in our social security system as an insured person in 1992; If the old system had continued, this lady would have retired in 2012 at the age of 38. Due to the gradual age application in the current system, this lady will be able to start receiving a pension in 2022, that is, at the age of 48. Essentially, this person has already earned the right to retirement, he just has to wait until this age before he can receive a pension.
Dear brothers and sisters, my dear nation, my patriotic people;
There is no such thing as retirement at the age of 38 anywhere in the world. A person who will work for 20 years and retire at the age of 38 will receive a salary and health insurance from the state without working for 40 years; Would that happen? The social security system of any country in the world cannot withstand this, and there is no such practice there.
At a time when the average human lifespan was not even 60 years old, there was perhaps an explanation for retiring in the 40s; But today, the average human lifespan in our country has exceeded 78. Even a person who retires at the age of 48, let alone 38, will remain in the system for about 30 years. Today, the average retirement age in our country is 52 years, in European countries this figure is 65. Turkey is just beginning to move towards the age limit of 65. While the average insurance period in our country is 26 years, the life in retirement is between 27 and 31 years. The average duration of insurance in Europe is 35 years, while the time spent in retirement is usually less than 20 years. In our country, a pensioner receives back the premium he has paid throughout his entire working life as a pension in 6 years. As can be seen, even in the current situation, our pension system is in a deplorable state.
According to the calculations of the Social Security Institution, there are 6.3 million people who fall into the group of so-called retirement age, which is very important. About 1 million of them are civil servants, while the rest are those who work under a service contract or on their own account. Of these, 1.3 million will be able to retire immediately, and the rest will be able to claim their retirement gradually.
Do you know what is the additional annual cost of this proposal to our country? 26 billion pounds. Do you know where this figure reaches in total, considering all the beneficiaries of early retirement? It amounts to 750 billion liras. I ask my nation whether we have the right to put such a burden on the backs of our nation and our country at a time when we are fighting an economic war of liberation.
Now, such things have emerged that, on the one hand, opportunists have emerged during the period of the economic liberation war, they were tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, as well as diapers, flour, bread, while these were made from one place by turning them into opportunities with stockpiling, this and that, on the other hand, they have sprung up before us now. What will it do? He will retire early. What will happen after that? He will go and continue to work in another job according to himself. So double stitching, there can be no such thing, this is not called justice, this is not called rights. Today, the Western world is increasing the age of retirement, not below 65, but raising it. Why? The costs to the country are very, very high for him. In the past, there used to be early retirement in the Scandinavian countries, but now that even the Scandinavian countries cannot afford to pay for it, they have started to raise the retirement age.
Don't get me wrong, we don't have eyes on anyone's law. There has never been another party in Turkey that protects the rights of our people, raises the level of welfare and fulfills the requirements of the social state principle as much as the AK Party.Â  We have also brought the greatest services in terms of our retirements. When we came to the government, there was a pension of 68 liras in this country, today there is almost no pension below the minimum wage; from where to where. In addition, we give a bonus of 1000 liras to all our pensioners on Ramadan and Eid al-Adha. In health care, we have left no one outside the social security umbrella in a way that is unprecedented in the world.
As the opportunities of our country increase, we will continue to improve the situation of all our citizens, as well as our pensioners. However, our hearts cannot consent to the deterioration of all the balances of the country in order to please a certain segment. Moreover, this step or this campaign should not be turned into a political profit, if this happens, it will be a very heavy price for our country.
We all know this fact very well: A significant number of those who are campaigning today on the grounds that they are stuck with the age at retirement will continue to work formally or informally, as I have just stated, after they start receiving pensions. That is, on the one hand, they will receive a salary from the state, and on the other hand, they will again look at their work, their power. If this is the truth, why should we drag our social security system into a new quagmire, a new disaster? I invite the parties that raised this issue in the parliament to reassess the situation in the light of these facts. Turkey has suffered a lot from populist policies and uncalculated steps taken in the past, let's not revive this dangerous habit again.
Dear friends;
With the June 24 elections, Turkey has hopefully entered a 5-year period of uninterrupted service in the executive and legislative branches. When we successfully complete the local government elections in March 2019, we will open the doors of a new era of service in municipalities. The best thing about the new management system of our country is that it guarantees a stable service period in this way.
As a matter of fact, as soon as we came to work, we immediately started a 3-stage study. First, we prepared our 100-day emergency action program. We have prioritized 400 projects with the institutions affiliated to the Presidency and our 16 ministries, which are also directly under our responsibility, and included them in this program. We follow the implementation stages of the program step by step through a team we have established at the Presidency.
At the last meeting of the Council of Ministers, we made a comprehensive assessment of the first 50 days, after which we prepared the medium-term program covering the next 3-year period. We have determined the name of this study, which aims to reach Turkey's goals by overcoming global and regional challenges, as the New Economy Program.
Between 2002 and 2013, Turkey exceeded the targets of its economic program many times. Since 2013, we have fallen short of some of our targets due to the challenges we have witnessed together. In this critical period, which lasted until the last economic fluctuation, especially from those who tried to squeeze us with the Gezi events, we managed to keep our country intact despite everything. We survived the traps set to destroy us with minor stumbles and continued to walk in line with our 2023 goals.
We have created our new economy program around the themes of 'balancing, discipline, change'. Thus, I believe that we have developed an important approach that will both compensate for our losses so far and show strong resistance against possible future attacks. In the meantime, we have completed the preparations for the first budget of our new management system. Hopefully, we will present the 2019 central government budget law proposal to the Parliament tomorrow. Thus, we have taken another important step towards implementing our new economic policies.
To be honest, we have made significant sacrifices in this process. We did what needed to be done to protect the interests of our country and our nation, even at the cost of swallowing when necessary. We have not hidden or hidden anything from our nation until today. We carried out every action we took together with our nation and in front of our nation's eyes. We have followed the same path recently. The bond of love between us and our nation has the sincerity and sincerity to explain what we are doing and where we want to go, even if we cannot verbalize everything sometimes. Such periods are periods of patience, as I always say, 'men sabera to victory'; yes, we will be patient and, God willing, we will achieve victory.
Dear brothers and sisters;
Since the day we took over the administration of the country, we have suffered a lot due to the cumbersomeness and resistance of the bureaucracy. No matter how hard we tried, no matter what measures we took, we hoped to leave this problem, which we could not solve, behind with the new management system, and we still do. However, we still hear complaints about the cumbersomeness of the bureaucracy, its refusal to take responsibility and sign. Now that more than 4 months have passed, we need to quickly put such troubles behind us. Our ministers have largely formed the cadres they will work with. Our deputy ministers and other senior executives will embrace their work with all hands so that the cadres under them will serve in the same way.
All bureaucrats, especially those who hold positions such as general manager, deputy general manager, head of department, if our ministerial colleagues have not made any other savings, it means that they continue their duties. There is no such procedure for reappointment of persons in such positions. We need bureaucrats who do not worry about their seats, but who strive to fulfill their responsibilities, struggle and produce work. Whoever has taken a passive position just to avoid losing his title, in our opinion, that person has already ceased to be a part of our team. When we hear such complaints, we will not look anyone in the eye. At a time when Turkey needs the most actions, projects and efforts, we cannot waste time on anyone's whims, excuses and career calculations. My request to my fellow ministers; If they have not done it yet, they should complete the transfer of authority quickly and ensure that the wheels of bureaucracy are clicking.
Our nation gave us 52.6 percent of the votes at the ballot box so that we can easily overcome such problems and take faster and more effective actions. A blockage of bureaucracy due to timidity is like crossing the sea and drowning in a stream. We cannot do such a disservice to our nation or to ourselves. For this reason, we must speed up the work as soon as possible and put forward actions that can meet the expectations of our nation.
Dear brothers and sisters;
During this period, as you know, we experienced a Pastor Brunson incident in Izmir within the Turkish judicial system, within the legal system, and the Turkish justice system made its decision on this issue and put this decision into practice. Another event is the steps we have taken in the fight against terrorism these days, and they continue in the same way with determination. Of course, the steps we have taken in the north of Syria, the steps taken in Manbij and the fact that our soldiers are currently training jointly with American soldiers in Manbij. And as soon as possible, of course, the calendar was 90 days, unfortunately, we cannot say that the 90-day calendar worked at the moment, it did not work. If it doesn't work, we know how to cut our belly there, we will do what is necessary. In the same way, if the necessary steps are not taken in the east of the Euphrates, and if this delay process continues, we will take the necessary steps at the highest level in the east of the Euphrates, especially against this YPG-PYD, or rather the PKK, and we will do what is necessary.
All this is not only for the peace of our country, but also for the peace of those strange-gureba people living in that region. Their flight to Turkey is not in vain. These steps we have taken are aimed at protecting them as well. Whatever step we took in Idlib, it is the step we took in Afrin, it is the step we took in Jarablus, and these are the steps we took in that terror corridor. Turkey has taken these steps decisively and will continue to do so in the future.
Dear brothers and sisters; With these feelings, I wish you success in the work of the Assembly. I offer my love and respect to all of you. Stay healthy.

Mr. President,
Dear Secretary General,
Dear Heads of State and Government,
Distinguished delegates;
I salute you on behalf of myself and my country. United Nations 72. In his capacity as President of the General Assembly, I would like to thank Mr. Lajcak for the successful work he has carried out over the past year. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Espinosa on taking over the presidency of the General Assembly. I hope that this year's General Assembly will be beneficial for all the peoples of the world.
Dear delegates;
This meeting marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. We are doing it on the anniversary. The League of Nations, which was established after the war, was replaced by the United Nations after the Second World War. Of course, in its 73-year history, the United Nations has carried out studies and achieved successes that cannot be underestimated.
However, it is also a fact that over time, the United Nations has moved away from meeting humanity's expectations for peace and prosperity. In particular, the Security Council has taken on a structure that serves only the interests of 5 members with veto rights and remains a spectator to the atrocities in other parts of the world. In the past, massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia, more recently in Myanmar and still in Palestine have all taken place in front of the eyes of the United Nations Security Council. The efforts of those who do not speak out against the oppression of the Palestinians to cut aid to them only increase the courage of the oppressors. Even if the whole world turns its back, we, as Turkey, will continue to stand by the oppressed Palestinians and protect the historical and legal status of Jerusalem, our first qibla.
Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, scenes that none of us want to see, from ethnic cleansing to mass murder, reappear every day. Likewise, there is a state of dissatisfaction with all of the studies carried out under this big roof, from health to education, from food to culture. Our hearts do not consent to the fact that such an important structure has become an institution whose name is constantly mentioned with failure.
That is why we call for a comprehensive reform of the structure and functioning of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, at every opportunity. That's why we believe that we are the voice of the common conscience of humanity when we say 'The world is bigger than 5'. Because the world is no longer in the conditions of the post-World War II period.
There are representatives from 193 countries here, so why shouldn't all 193 countries be represented on the United Nations Security Council? Why shouldn't they all become permanent members? Only 5 members, the others are unfortunately temporary, they have no initiative there.
Limiting the reform of the United Nations to the budget will not contribute to the solution of the real problems, nor will it make anyone happy. There is a need to increase the effectiveness of this institution, which I see as very important for the future of the world, in the fields of security, development and social equality, which are its main areas of duty.
Dear friends;
When we look towards the world, starting from the geography we live in as Turkey, we see that there are very important things that can be done through the United Nations. First of all, it is justice that, according to our understanding, will ensure the order, salvation and happiness of the world.
In our civilization, there is a circle that we refer to as the circle of justice, which is based on the establishment and operation of the relationship between society, law, state administration, state power, economy and justice in the most correct way. The chains of this circle, all of which are related to each other, have been shattered in many places in today's world. This is why our world today is in the grip of political, social and economic instability. For the sake of a peaceful and safe future for all of us, we have to succeed in concluding the struggle of humanity, which started with the search for justice, with the establishment of justice.
If the wealth of the 62 richest people in the world today is equivalent to about half of the total population, that is, 3.6 billion people, then there is a problem. While 821 million people in the world fall asleep hungry most nights, and 672 million people are diagnosed with obesity, there is a problem here. If 258 million people in different geographies are taking to the roads to live in humane conditions, and 68 million people are forcibly displaced, there is a problem here. If a child born in Africa is 9 times more likely to die in the first months of life than a child born in this city, then there is a problem.
Hazrat Mevlana, who enlightened the hearts of the whole world with the light he lit from Konya in the middle of Anatolia, defines justice as ""putting something in its place, that is, giving the right to its owner"". Let us make the United Nations the mouthpiece and implementer of humanity's expectation of justice to ensure that everything in this world is put in its place. Let's establish a global governance system that will shield the oppressed, extend a hand to the hungry and exposed, and instill hope in future generations.
The words spoken, the determinations made and the proposals put forward on this podium will only have such a meaning. Because, again, according to Hazrat Rumi, a tyrant is ""a person who does not fulfill his duties"". If we want to make the United Nations a source of justice, not tyranny, we must hold fast to our duties.
Dear delegates;
Turkey is still doing its best for a fairer world with its global humanitarian diplomacy. We host more than 4 million asylum seekers, 3.5 million of whom are Syrians, within our borders by providing services that are unparalleled in the world. The amount we have spent so far only for Syrian refugees has reached 32 billion dollars. In addition, we are providing all kinds of humanitarian aid to millions of people in the Jarablus, Rai, al-Bab, Afrin regions and the Idlib de-escalation zone, which we have previously secured in Syria. The number of Syrian students attending school in our country is over 600 thousand. Asylum seekers in our country can benefit from all health services, including medicine, free of charge, without any discrimination. We meet all the needs of the refugees staying in the camps.
On the other hand, the support we receive from abroad is 600 million dollars from international organizations and the amount actually given from the European Union so far, this does not go into our national budget, it only goes into international organizations, which is at the level of 1.7 billion euros. The European Union's support promise of â¬3 billion + â¬3 billion is not used effectively enough because it is conditional on the project. However, we continue the services we provide to asylum seekers every day and without interruption, regardless of any project. We expect more and more flexible support to be given to Turkey, which has prevented a large influx of refugees in the world, especially in Europe, with the opportunities it provides to asylum seekers.
Moreover, Turkey provides very important humanitarian development assistance all over the world, as well as refugees within and beyond its borders. As of this year, Turkey ranks 6th in the world in total development aid and first in humanitarian aid. Although we do not rank 17th in the world in terms of economic size, the fact that we rank first in development and humanitarian aid is an expression of the importance we attach to this issue as a country.
Dear delegates;
As the theme of this year's General Assembly affirms, our world needs global leadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies more than ever. As Turkey, we have made significant efforts in this direction under the umbrella of the United Nations. The peace mediation initiative we launched with Finland in 2010 has been supported by a 56-member friendship group. We have taken serious steps in this direction within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, of which we still hold the term presidency. The Alliance of Civilizations Initiative, which we launched with Spain, has turned into a United Nations initiative with the participation of 146 member countries.
We are implementing a development program that I believe will set an example for the whole world in terms of reviving Somalia, which is struggling with hunger. We are mobilizing our means to help millions of oppressed people in Arakan, which is far away from our country. We have made sincere efforts to resolve the Gulf crisis. We encourage all parties in Iraq to strive for the common future of the country. We strive to prevent the negativities experienced in various parts of the world, especially in Europe, on issues such as racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia.
We are also taking an active stance against the developments in Syria, which has become a place where most of the countries in the world export their radical groups. We are trying to make Syria a peaceful place again, both through our support for the Geneva and Astana processes, and through the safe zones we continue to create on the ground. By clearing the Jarablus and Rai regions from DAESH and the Afrin region from the PKK, PYD, YPG terrorist organization, we have made an area of 4 thousand square kilometers a safe and peaceful place for millions of Syrians.
Finally, with the Sochi agreement we signed with Russia, we prevented the regime's bloody attacks on the Idlib de-escalation zone, where 3.5 million civilians live. We believe that by preventing the repetition of the massacres that took place in Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Daraa and Eastern Ghouta in Idlib, we have kept the path to peace and a political solution open in Syria. Our goal is to clear the entire Syrian territory from Manbij to the Iraqi border from terrorists. From here, I call on all parties to support the search for a just and sustainable political solution in Syria with a constructive understanding.
We want a principled approach to be taken against terrorist organizations. Those who equip terrorists with tens of thousands of trucks and thousands of cargo planes for the sake of their tactical interests will surely suffer in the future. Supporting terrorist organizations on the one hand, closing the doors to refugees on the other hand, and putting the entire burden of this on a few countries like Turkey will not make anyone's future safer or more prosperous. On the contrary, after a while, the problems postponed in this way reach a level that can no longer be overcome with existing measures.
For him, the de facto such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Ukraine; Let's make more sincere and constructive efforts for the solution of potential problem areas such as the Balkans, the Caucasus, North Africa, Central Africa, the Gulf and the Eastern Mediterranean. Remember, if we cannot establish a minimum level of peace and prosperity in all parts of the world, we must know that no one can continue to live safely within their own borders.
Dear delegates;
Not all terrorist organizations derive all their power from their armed actions, some use more sophisticated, more secret, more deceptive methods. FETÃ, which attempted a coup attempt in our country on the night of July 15, 2016, martyred 251 of our citizens and injured 2193 of our citizens, is such a terrorist organization. So, where is the leader of this now, where is the head of this? The head of this is right now, yes, in Pennsylvania in America. He currently lives on 400 acres of land, from where he exports terror to 160 countries of the world.
This organization continues its activities under the guise of a non-governmental organization or commercial organization by hiding behind glittering concepts such as education, cooperation, and dialogue. The terrorist organization, which has been developing and growing with this deception in our country for 40 years, showed its true face when it felt strong enough. It launched coup attempts one after another, first through its security and judicial institutions, and then through its infiltrators into our Armed Forces. Over time, this organization has tried to use the economic and bureaucratic power it has in our country to control politics and society together with the state.
Thanks to the determined struggle we have waged in the last 5 years with the support of our nation, we have largely eliminated FETÃ in our country. Now we see that this terrorist organization is carrying out similar activities all over the world. Countries that heed Turkey's warnings and learned from its experiences are exposing this organization one by one and expelling it from their lands. On the other hand, unfortunately, many countries that we consider friendly insist on not giving them to us. Of course, those who still do not realize the danger will pay a heavy price.
For example, the FETÃ terrorist organization receives 763 million dollars annually from the state budget only through charter schools in 27 states of the United States, and this is where the source comes from. This figure does not include the revenues of the organization's commercial organizations that are involved in all kinds of money laundering and other structures that look like non-governmental organizations with hidden agendas. From here, I invite all the countries of the world to be careful and take action against the FETÃ terrorist organization, I say it openly because it hurts. We must show the same solidarity for this insidious organization as we do for armed terrorist organizations and bloody regimes. We are ready to share our experience and information on this subject with any country that wishes.
Dear delegates; Trade wars have harmed humanity in every period, and today we are on the verge of such a process, and we are even in it. None of us can remain silent in the face of the arbitrary cancellation of trade agreements, the spread of protectionist policies and the use of economic sanctions as weapons. The damage of these distorted developments will eventually touch every country. We must all work together to prevent the world trade order from being disrupted by unilateral decisions.
At a time when we must work for the success of the United Nations' 2030 global development goals, no one wants the world to experience another economic disruption. It is easy to create chaos and difficult to maintain order. Today, some countries are persistently trying to sow chaos. There is no greater danger than a world order in which compassion, conscience, law, equity and hope are lost, and we are all facing such a danger right now.
Turkey is in favor of free trade and human movement. Every regression in these issues affects us negatively. Moreover, the fact that this attitude is expressed with the language of threats, imposition, and complete ignoring of the history of bilateral relations increases our sadness even more. We are in favor of solving our problems through constructive dialogue on equal terms.
As in every field, we expect responsible action in the economy. We are in effective, harmonious and constructive cooperation with our counterparts on international platforms such as the World Trade Organization, the G-20, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Customs Union we have established with the European Union. As Turkey, we always express that we are in favor of winning together with our interlocutors with whom we do business and cooperate. The goal is win-win...
While this sincere approach is evident, we consider the accusations and pressures against our country as unfair. We believe that together with countries and institutions that share the same perspective as us, we can overcome this political and economic chaos that the world is trying to be dragged into. We look forward to your support in this regard.
Before I end my words, I would like to share two points: First; We think that there is a need for an organization within the United Nations that is related to our young people, who are our future. As Turkey, we propose that the United Nations Youth Organization be established as soon as possible and that its center be Istanbul, one of the cities that is the symbol of world history. We can allocate a youth center that is still being built in Istanbul to this organization.
Secondly; At the World Aging Summit held in our country in 2005, 2019 was determined as the 'International Year of Aging'. Â In this context, the United Nations International Agency on Aging is being established in our country and the 3rd World Congress on Aging is being held in Istanbul. We invite you to this congress to be held in Istanbul on December 10th.
Once again, 73. I wish the work of the General Assembly to be successful, and on behalf of myself and my state, I greet all the countries and peoples represented under this roof, which is the common parliament of humanity, with love and respect. Stay healthy.
"
Speech at the TURKEN Foundation Gala Dinner,2018-09-24,
Their Speech at the Meeting with Turkish and Muslim Community in the USA,2018-09-24,"

Dear members of the Turkish American Community,
Dear American Muslim brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen, dear young people;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi and blessings.
Dear brothers and sisters;
On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to sincerely thank the Turkish-American National Steering Committee for organizing this meeting and bringing us together once again.
Our citizens who have been living in this country for years have contributed greatly to the development of Turkish-American relations with the non-governmental organizations they have established and their individual efforts. At a time when our opportunities were limited, our people here made every effort to ensure that Turkey and the principles it defended were heard by the American public. In particular, they made truly admirable efforts to prevent the spread of Armenian lies about the events of 1915. I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens who are volunteer ambassadors of Turkey through you.
In the same way, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our friends and brothers who defend the rights and laws of Turkey for their affection for our country and nation, even though they are not Turkish citizens. Hopefully, I believe that we will carry out similar works together shoulder to shoulder in the coming period.
Turkey has more than 6 million citizens scattered all over the world, most of them in European countries. These citizens have a serious presence in all areas of life, from politics to art, from science to trade, from sports to culture. With the businesses they have opened, they now contribute to the economies of the countries they have adopted as their second home. With their success in politics, they both serve the society they live in and contribute to the proper promotion of Turkey.
We have citizens like Professor Doctor Aziz Sancar who have been instrumental in the evolution of humanity with the breakthrough they have made in the world of science. We have professors and academicians who are widely accepted and appreciated for their research. We have entrepreneurs, companies, and successful young people whose names are almost identified with Turkey. We are proud of the achievements of all our citizens, regardless of their views, as long as they do not fall into the pit of betrayal. We see them as the pride of the Turkish nation. With this understanding, we take care of our diaspora wherever it is in the world and support it with all our means.
Dear brothers and sisters;
I would like to draw your attention to the following point due to its importance: The stronger you are in the countries you live in, the stronger Turkey will be. The stronger Turkey is, the better it will take care of its brothers, friends, the oppressed and the victims. Your weakness will also be written in the name of our country.
Similar situations apply to our Muslim brothers and sisters who come from different corners of the world and make America their home. In fact, we do not see them as separate from our own citizens. When we talk about Turkey, we say that we are a country with 81 million citizens and 6.5 million diasporas, as well as hundreds of millions of brothers and sisters all over the world, from Africa to Asia and America.
Turkey, remember, has a physical geography and a geography of the heart. The borders of our country's hearts are actually far beyond its physical borders. That is why, even though we do not have geographical ties, we are on the road to be a balm for the wounds of our Arakanese brothers. Here, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, my wife, can all go to Arakan together. That is why, while no one goes regardless of geographical distance, we are closely interested in the problems of our Somali brothers.
Is there an embassy like ours in Somalia right now? No. In fact, the countries that call themselves mine do not have embassies in Somalia, they have opened embassies in containers, and they manage Somalia with it. Our largest embassy in the world is in Somalia. We have established our hospitals, we have opened our schools in Somalia, in Somalia. Currently, we have hundreds and thousands of students from Somalia at the point of education in Turkey. We are proud of you and we applaud you for your achievements. That is why we are struggling to strengthen our ties with our relatives in the Turkic republics. Wherever there is an oppressed and victimized person in the world, we embrace their distress and try to be the voice of the silent masses.
Our American Muslim brothers and sisters are also in our geography of hearts that transcends borders and knows no distance or barriers. With this understanding, we are intensifying our contacts with you day by day, both through non-governmental organizations such as the Turkish-American National Steering Committee and individually. You know our Rabia, what is in our Rabia? There is one nation, there is one flag, there is one homeland, there is one state.
Last year, we had a very productive meeting hosted by the Turkish-American National Steering Committee. In New York, we had a conversation with our brothers and sisters from different states of America from different backgrounds. Now, just now, President Mr. Mutlu made a very assertive statement, although he said tens of thousands, I say that if you gather such and such thousands, or ten thousand, fifteen thousand, in the largest indoor sports hall in America, of course we will be very happy. And I believe that by bringing together all our brothers and sisters from all over America, such an organization will not only stay in America, but will reach all over the world in waves.
I am really fortunate to be with you on the same occasion again this year. Right now, my Vice Presidents are with me. Our ministers, as well as my fellow deputies, are here. In addition to all this, my chief advisors to the President of the Republic are here with me, and together with this visit, these meetings, because we will have meetings with the leaders of many countries in three days. In addition to these bilateral meetings, there will be some meetings, there will be meetings that my wife will attend. And with these meetings, we will strive to make the best use of this process. From here, we will go to Germany and have three-day official invitation programs in Germany.
We are witnessing an increasing affection and curiosity among American Muslims towards our country. The resolute stance of our country, especially in matters related to the Islamic world, is undoubtedly the most important reason for this interest. Praise be to God, our country is making a sincere effort on every issue that breaks the hearts of the ummah, especially the Syrian crisis and the Palestinian issue. At a time when countries whose economic situation is far ahead of ours are eating each other in order not to accept refugees, we have taken care of more than 3.5 million oppressed Syrians. We did not hand over any of our brothers and sisters who took refuge at our door to murderers with bloody hands.
Brothers;
Do you know that the world is bigger than five? The world is bigger than five. Because, my brothers and sisters, in the United Nations General Assembly, which includes 194 countries, a world cannot be condemned between the lips of five countries. Permanent member and temporary member, this distinction should not exist. If there will be, 20 of the 20 members will be permanent members and rotates. Countries from every continent and faith group in the world will take their place in these permanent members. When that happens, there is justice. There is no longer a post-World War II world; A new world is currently being built. If the United Nations is to establish justice, this is the only way we can establish it, otherwise it is not possible.
Is the United Nations able to do this now? There are so many incidents going on, the Syrian problem has been going on for 8 years, has it been solved? No. Israel commits all kinds of atrocities, there are decisions that have been made, and despite these decisions, does Israel comply with the decisions made? Well, what's the point? Here's justice for him...
They left the Syrian people alone in their struggle for rights, justice and freedom; But we didn't leave it alone. We have ensured peace in an area of 4 thousand square kilometers, which is right next to our borders and was once occupied by PYD-YPG terrorists and DAESH criminals. Thanks to the operations we carried out by giving martyrs, we ensured that more than 260 thousand of our Syrian brothers and sisters returned to their homeland. As in the recent Idlib crisis, we have made intensive efforts in the diplomatic field to ensure that not a single civilian gets a nosebleed.
We have started to reap the fruits of these efforts. In the regions where terrorists once roamed with their hands and arms, today Syrian children go to school without any fear. It's going in Afrin, it's going in al-Bab, it's going in Jarablus. Hopefully, we will continue to increase the safe zones inside Syria, including the east of the Euphrates, in the coming period. We will continue our struggle until the terrorist threat to our country comes to an end and the gangs that threaten the future of Syria are eradicated.
In the same way, we will not abandon Jerusalem, our first qibla, to the ambitions of the occupiers and those who inflict state terror on the Palestinians. We will fight at the highest level of diplomacy against the harassment of the Israeli and American administrations that trample on the dignity and dignity of Jerusalem. I am speaking before you as the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. As the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we have made every effort to implement the decisions we have taken at the extraordinary Istanbul summits, and the decisions we have taken from the United Nations General Assembly have been passed positively with the attention of the world.
Dear brothers and sisters;
I believe that the events we have experienced in recent years should be a source of caution and awakening for all of us. The main reason why Muslims have limited influence on the issues occupying the world agenda is that verses from the Holy Quran have just been read and translated, unfortunately, Muslims do not follow this command of the Holy Quran. This fragmentation destroys us because it doesn't fit.
There, our Lord says, EsteÃ®zu billah, Bismillah, ""Va'tasimÃ» bihablillÃ¢hi jamÃ®Ã¢n wa lÃ¢ tafarrakÃ»"". He says, ""All of you should hold fast to the rope of Allah, hold fast to the Qur'an of Allah, and do not fall into disarray."" He continued, ""If you fall, your strength will be gone, you will become weak."" Unfortunately, the Islamic world has become weak because of this. But if we were one, if we were together, if we were big, if we were alive, if we fulfilled the requirements of our brotherhood, it would be different.
It was just stated in the speech, I think my brother Osama said it, that Muslims, who should be like ""the limbs of a body"", in other words, ""the bricks of a wall"", as described by the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Qur'an, unfortunately are longing for violence today. They cannot take a uniform stance on issues that concern their own religions and their own future, let alone global issues.
Let me be clear; What is the reason for the fact that the Palestinian issue has not been resolved for so many years? More than Israel's lawlessness, it is the lack of unity among Muslims. What was Palestine in 1948, what is Palestine in 2018 now? We are where we started. Huge territories in 48, but at the moment, unfortunately, a handful of Palestinian lands... The fact that some deranged Buddhists have the courage to brutally murder our brothers and sisters in Arakan in front of the cameras is also due to the fragmentation of the Islamic world. The reason why the persecution in Syria has not been ended for seven years; It is the shortsightedness of the states that will lead the Islamic world.
Of course, we accept the impotence of institutions such as the United Nations Security Council, which are the guarantors of global peace and stability, in the impasse of all these problems. We know that due to the nature of these organizations, they often serve to protect the interests of certain powers rather than global peace. However, we have to admit that we are making the real mistake by leaving the solution of our problems to others.
As Muslims, we cannot expect other states to make constructive contributions to issues for which we are not responsible. Especially if the countries we are hoping for are countries that have plans for our region, then the responsibility is entirely on our shoulders. Looking for the fault in someone else will only waste us time. From this point of view, we should look for the cure for our problems not in other places, but in ourselves, within ourselves. Instead of blaming others, we should be able to show the virtue and courage to face our own mistakes first. Only in this way can we learn from our mistakes and prevent history from repeating itself.
Brothers;
Our Lord commands us to be united in the Qur'an with the hymn of the command he commands, and we must obey this command. Unless we provide this, this will not work. If we obey the commandment, ""Only believers are brothers,"" then we will get results. And for this, we need to maintain this brotherhood. My dear brothers and sisters; Regardless of colors, races and tribes, only your unity is very important.
Brothers;
Revelation starts with us, from ourselves. First of all, we need to ensure unity, solidarity and unity among ourselves. The way to do this is to love each other for God's sake and to endure each other for Allah's sake. It is imperative that we learn to treat our brothers and sisters with humility rather than arrogance, to show understanding in the face of their mistakes, and to forgive them when necessary. ""You cannot have faith unless you love one another""; We need to achieve this. And this is also the way of Heaven. We can only get out of this shackle if we love each other with our shortcomings.
We do not use our sectarian and ethnic differences as an occasion for conflict or superiority; We will see it as an example of the colorfulness and richness of the ummah. We will look for ways to meet on the common denominators of humanity without excluding members of other religions. The best method of preaching is to wear the garment of the Qur'an and Sunnah. Before the revelation comes down, remember what was the title of the Prophet (peace be upon him)? As the ummah of a Prophet known as 'Muhammadu al-Amin', we will set an example for others with our life, behavior, kindness and honesty.
We will look for ways to be strong, especially in the political field. The political mechanism is the fastest way for us to convey our demands, expectations and concerns to decision-makers. No group that leaves this field blank will achieve its goals, no matter how many they have. In this respect, I welcome the recent growing interest of American Muslims in politics and in the upcoming elections. As a result of the elections, I believe that we will hopefully see many of our brothers and sisters in the representation and decision-making authority. I would also like to express that as Turkey, we are ready to share our experience in this regard.
As I end my words with these thoughts, I greet you with respect and love and wish you success in your work. On the other hand, I would like to thank my dear brother who contributed to this organization in your presence. May Allah perpetuate our unity and solidarity. I entrust you all to God, stay healthy.

Dear administrators of our Turkish Armed Forces, National Defense University and Military Academies,
Dear students who graduated from their schools and their precious families,
Dear guests;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I would like to congratulate each of our 146 Turkish and 78 guest officers who completed their education in our Army, Naval and Air Force Academies.
As it is known, after the July 15 coup attempt, we restructured all our Military Academies by gathering them under the National Defense University. For this reason, we could not graduate Turkish students from our military academies in 2016 and 2017. In order to meet the need for officers, we started trainings to gain basic understanding of military and officership. Thus, in November last year and in July of this year, we recruited approximately 3 thousand lieutenants to the Turkish Armed Forces.
In the same way, they continued to contribute to the manpower of our army with their graduates in our non-commissioned officer vocational schools affiliated to our university. Today, we are giving the first graduates of our military academies after the restructuring. Hopefully, we will go to BalÄ±kesir tomorrow and be with them and their families at the graduation ceremonies of our non-commissioned officers.
Our National Defense University will start the new academic year next October with a total of 6125 Turkish and 661 guest military students from 22 countries. Thus, the restructuring process that started after July 15 will be completed to a large extent and our military academies will be able to carry out their activities at full capacity.
Some people make propaganda that 'military schools have been closed', but our military academies, non-commissioned officer vocational schools and institutes continue their activities, as they do here. Military high schools were closed only because they were no longer needed in today's conditions. Currently, the total number of students at our university is over 9500. Only this year, nearly 4 thousand new students will be admitted to the schools affiliated to our university. As can be seen, military schools, far from being closed, continue to serve our country by expanding their capacity and field of activity.
Of course, at least as important is the content of education in our military schools. If we limit our reform to meeting the personnel needs of our Turkish Armed Forces to the signboard, we will be deceiving ourselves. We have to change the mentality here. Turkey needs an army and manpower that will defend its country and nation in the best way possible, not one that constantly produces coups and juntas and becomes a tool of tutelage. I know that our National Defense University has carried out very important studies in this direction. However, I think we have not yet reached the level we desire in terms of content. Now that we have substantially completed the corporate restructuring process, we can concentrate all our energy and time on the content.
We are determined to bring our Turkish Armed Forces to the highest level not only with their weapons, not only with their manpower, not only with their physical performance, but also with their perspective on life, the world, our country and the responsibilities undertaken. Hopefully, the coming period will be a period in which great reforms will be undertaken in this direction. Like all other achievements of Turkey, it is absolutely impossible to go back from the new system we have established with the National Defense University. I closely follow and support all the work of our university, our Rector and our deans.
Dear guests;
Historians define the Turkish nation as a 'soldier nation' or 'army nation'. The emphasis on military service here does not mean that the Turkish people will not be useful for anything else, as some claim, on the contrary, the concept of a soldier nation tells us that our nation is a nation that rises to total doom when it comes to the call to prayer, flag, homeland and state.
We know from today's experience that military service and all related activities are the basic infrastructure and locomotive of the development, growth and strengthening of societies. From qualified manpower to high technology, there are needs related to military service at the source of all kinds of developments. The results obtained from this are adapted to other areas, from trade to education, and contribute to the achievement of the goals of societies. It is imperative that we operate this system, which is used in all developed countries, effectively. In fact, we see examples of this truth in our own history.
Recently, we celebrated the anniversary of the great victory we won in Manzikert 947 years ago with tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters. About 1 century after Manzikert, the Turkmens, who settled in the region starting from Dobruja under the leadership of SarÄ± Saltuk, who has traces in every corner of Anatolia and the Balkans, are the most obvious example of our military nation. This settlement, which started with 12 thousand people in the first place, has expanded with results in a wide range of areas from agriculture and animal husbandry to trade, from the development of cities to education. This event, which took place during the Seljuk period before the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, shows us that lands cannot be conquered without conquering hearts.
Yesterday was the 492nd anniversary of the Battle of MohÃ¡cs. Suleiman the Magnificent appeared in front of his soldiers on the MohÃ¡cs Plain and started the battle by praying: ""Divine, power and power are yours. Hymns, thrifts and blessings are yours. Divine, grace and grace are yours. Thy blessings, blessings, blessings and blessings are yours. Do not upset the Ummah of Muhammad (peace be upon him). A lot of curve delight the enemies.""
Yes, our armies, from the commander in chief to the last private, fought with this submission, with this faith. For this reason, our nation's wrist has not been bent for thousands of years, it has always managed to be reborn from its ashes.
What makes our ancestors different from the imperialist and barbarian armies in history is their perspective on human beings. In the words of Yunun Emre, it is unthinkable for a nation that ""loves the created because of the Creator"" to behave otherwise. It is not for nothing that our soldiers, who serve all over the world, from Afghanistan to Kosovo, from Syria to Somalia, are primarily winning the hearts of the people of the region, unlike the soldiers of other countries. Wherever we go, we see our soldiers loved by the people of those places. Like each of our people, every soldier has this understanding in his leaven.
We will continue to strengthen our Turkish Armed Forces with all its soldiers, from officers to privates, in accordance with the characteristics of our nation. We will not only save our army from the contempt of terrorist organizations that are the enemies of our country and nation, especially FETÃ and PKK, but we will also strengthen its domestic and national quality in every aspect. In this regard, we trust our National Defense University and our command level.
Dear friends;
History has shown us that there is a price to pay for living in this geography. This price; To be under constant threat is to be in a constant state of vigilance. It is certainly not our preference for Turkey's agenda to be constantly on the agenda of terrorist attacks, humanitarian crises in its region, the troubles of the victims and the oppressed, and even natural disasters. In the words of Ibn Khaldun, geography is destiny. We will accept our fate and do whatever it takes to live our lives here. Like rootless people, rootless societies are doomed to be blown before the wind. Once you start to blow in front of the wind, only God knows where you will find yourself.
For the past 200 years, Anatolia has been the last refuge, the last port, the last homeland of our ancestors, no matter where they lived before. From the Balkans to the Caucasus, from North Africa to Crimea, wherever we have a brother in trouble, he has turned his direction to Anatolia. However, we have never forgotten the fact that we have nowhere to go but Anatolia.
In the Gallipoli War, in our War of Independence, on July 15, we defended our homeland with all our might. We have always left the ambitions of those who are desperate to cleanse Anatolia of the Turks and the Muslims, whom they see as equivalents, in their hands with this belief and this determination. Despite those who see Turkey only as the guardian of Anatolia and those who never accept it as its owner, we have embraced our country with all hands. We have seen that the red lines required to protect our homeland should start beyond our borders, not at our borders, and we have pursued a policy accordingly. That is why we are continuing the fight against terrorism in Syria and Iraq. This is the reason why we are trying to establish strong political, economic and social relations in every corner of the world, from Africa to South America.
One of the most important results of the fact that we have grown our country 3.5 times in the past 16 years is that we have put our stamp on every inch of the homeland. These lands, which we sometimes knead with sweat and sometimes with blood, are now our homeland forever. We will put one foot firmly on this place and travel the whole region, the whole world with the other. In this way, we will have the opportunity to stand by ourselves, our brothers and sisters, our friends, and everyone who has pinned their hopes on us, to heal their wounds, and to extend our hand.
They don't want to accept this Turkey. They have no tolerance for such a Turkey. Since they have become accustomed to Turkey, which has always followed and followed for a long time in the past, they cannot tolerate Turkey, which draws its own path of its own volition. No matter what they do, they will not be able to stand in the way of the great and powerful Turkey. Even if they think they have brought us to our knees a thousand times, we will continue to stand up a thousand times. What AbdÃ¼rrahim KarakoÃ§ says:
""Wherever I hear the sound of history
When I miss it, it comes to my mind...
The main thing we know is this main place
I think of the zodiac sign, the homeland...
Spreading in waves to three continents
Without a doubt, I think of Oman...
With love, with ecstasy, with justice
Knowledge falls, wisdom falls on my mind...
It's going to shake up the whole world
I think of the sealed edict...
As despair approached, I approached
I think of the remedy raining from the sky...
I think of a soul within a soul...""
Yes, we have never given up hope from the remedy raining from the sky, and we will never give up. We will always continue to search for souls within lives. Today's Turkey is much stronger, more prosperous and more capable than the Turkey of 20 years ago. Hopefully, tomorrow's Turkey will be stronger, more prosperous and more capable than today. As long as we take care of our Rabia and dominate life. One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state... For this, we will be united, we will be big, we will be alive, we will be brothers, we will be Turkey together.
With these feelings, I once again congratulate our officers who graduated from our Army, Navy and Air Force Academies. I wish them success in their duties. I ask our visiting officers to take our greetings to their countries. I wish success to our National Defense University and Military Academies in their work. Stay healthy.

Speech at the August 30 Victory Day Reception,2018-08-30,
Speech at the 2017 Media Oscars Award Ceremony of the Radio and Television Journalists Association,2018-08-29,"

Dear executives of the Association of Radio and Television Journalists,
Dear members of the media,
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. I would like to congratulate the members of the media to whom we will present their awards this year. I would also like to congratulate our association, which has been giving these awards since 1979, for its consistent work that embraces the sector. I wish success to all our colleagues working in our radio and television organizations. I once again congratulate you and our entire nation on the Eid al-Adha. I wish God's mercy on all our friends who have passed on to eternity, especially in this sector.
Dear friends;
Communication is a need that emerged with humanity and has come to the present day in different forms without interruption. This need has been tried to be met by many methods, from pigeons to smoke, from horseback and foot messengers to written documents dating back to before Christ. With the discovery of the printing press, a new era was opened in this field. Works that could be reproduced in a limited number of times as manuscripts or in wooden letters began to be produced in large numbers and at affordable costs with the invention of the printing press.
Another groundbreaking point in communication is, without a doubt, the invention of radio and television. Radio and television broadcasting has survived to the present day by showing great developments every year. Of course, in the meantime, we need to mention the internet, which is another milestone invention in communication. This communication tool, which was founded in the 1960s and has become an integral part of our daily lives in our country since the 1990s, still continues to develop with social media and other functions.
The reason why I remind you of this brief history of the media is to underline how deep-rooted and important the profession of journalism is. When we say printing press, radio, television and internet, we have almost become unimaginable of a life without media tools at the point we have reached today. With the introduction of the media into our lives, in addition to many facilitating and time-saving aspects, its controlling and guiding aspects have also started to be discussed.
In this context, many theories such as 'global village', 'gatekeeper', 'spiral of silence', 'information society' have been developed. When we look at it today, we see that a significant part of the media content, from news to cinema, from entertainment programs to cartoons, is monopolized by certain focuses. The monopolization of the media leads to the uniformity of clothing, architecture, eating and drinking habits, and many other individual and social behaviors.
Due to our duty, we did not set foot in the world, we almost did not leave the country. Everywhere we go, we see people dressed in more or less the same clothes, cities built with the same architecture, and places equipped with the same items. The local elements of the countries we visit only come across as authentic shows or exhibitions. I would like to express with regret that Turkey is not out of this monotony. You are the closest witnesses that we have worked hard to develop an architectural understanding inspired by our own history and civilization with our personal efforts during the AK Party governments. In the same way, we have made serious efforts to include works produced with such an approach in the media. Of course, there are good works being done; But it is also a fact that we still cannot get out of that infertility that surrounds the whole world.
Dear friends;
We know that there are many political, economic, cultural and social reasons for this process, which starts from the media and reaches every aspect of our daily lives. The conclusion we draw from our experience in our 40 years of political life is this: If you are strong as a country and a nation, you have the chance to protect your own authenticity. If you do not have such power, you will either isolate yourself from the world, and you will be subject to the global order, as there are not many such examples anymore.
Our method is different; We did not choose to be subordinate or isolated, our choice was to become strong. For this reason, we have grown, developed and enriched Turkey 3.5 times in the past 16 years. For this, we tried to make our country stand on its own feet in every field. For this reason, we have strived to ensure that all of our 81 provinces and each of our 81 million citizens can get a share of the wealth of our country. For this reason, we stood firm with our nation against everyone, from tutelage centers to coup plotters, from political madrabas to economic hitmen. For this, we have emphasized local and national in every field, and we continue to do so. Our struggle on July 15 alone is the most concrete and striking example of our determination in this direction as a nation.
To be frank, since the day we became a candidate for the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, the media has been one of the ones who attacked us the most and tried to lynch us the most. The mainstream media has been acting together with the tutelaries, coup plotters and mandates in our country for a long time. We have also waged great struggles against the media, which thinks it is a skill to be on the side of the marginalized instead of standing with the nation. As I said, inspired by one of our poets; We have come to this day with the headlines, each of which is thrown with the intention of a cannonball, and the pencil sharpeners who use their corners like bullets. We have not forgotten the headlines that were thrown for us when we were convicted by a court decision that would not fit into the law, conscience or morality. There is no limit to the incalculables written and drawn against us, our government and our party, the slanders thrown and the distortions made.
Those who tried to portray the Gezi betrayal as a 'social reaction', the December 17-25 police-judiciary coup attempt as 'respect for the law', the pit protests as 'civil resistance', and July 15 as 'theater' have always carried out their operations through the media. For years, a mentality that beautifies terrorists and humiliates, despises and despises the nation has been the crown jewel of the media. Weren't it always â sorry â members of the media who insulted the nation by calling them 'the man who scratches his belly', 'jerry-can-heads', 'sheep' and many other expressions?
Of course, our media has also had its share of the great change that Turkey has undergone. Today, I believe that we have a media that is more respectful of the truth and more balanced in its news and publications than before. I think that our Radio and Television Journalists Association, with whom we are together on the occasion of the award ceremony, has also made important contributions to this transformation. Once again, I congratulate the management and members of the association in your presence.
Dear friends;
The geography we live in has been an attractive place in every period of history. Societies have made many great sacrifices in order to have this geography, which has a history almost equal to the history of humanity. Last Sunday in Malazgirt, in Ahlat before Manzikert, we enthusiastically commemorated our ancestors, the owner of the victory that made Anatolia our home. From now on, we will build a Presidential mansion in Ahlat, even if it is a boutique. Mr. BahÃ§eli also made such a request to us, I hope he will raise him in a short time and go to Ahlat first, because Sultan Alparslan had established his hotel there, so we will set up our hotel there and go to Malazgirt from there. History does not repeat itself if a lesson is learned, and we will live it, we will keep it alive. From now on, we will continue to keep the memory of our ancestors alive in both Ahlat and Malazgirt.
We are going through a period in which we need to protect this geography, which has been ours for a thousand years with its bitterness and sweetness, much more tightly. As a country and a nation, we have had to stay on the defensive and constantly regress for the last 150-200 years. We left behind many homelands, each of which is a piece of our lives, with tears in our eyes and broken hearts. Today, wherever we go to our ancient geography, we continue to find artifacts, memories and traces that tell us about us. I recommend you, go to Ahlat and see the graves in more than 8 thousand cemeteries, I believe it will give you a different courage. There is a completely different history there. For this, we say; Turkey is not just a country with its current physical borders.
In the same way, we cannot see the Turkish nation as consisting only of those who live within these borders. There is a huge civilization, a huge history and a huge accumulation behind this country and nation. The borders of our country are different, but the borders of our hearts are completely different. For this reason, we not only provide the best, most beautiful and most advanced services to our citizens within the borders of our country, but also attach importance to embracing our brothers and sisters within the borders of our hearts at every opportunity. God willing, we will be in Kyrgyzstan on the 1st of the month and we will meet and hold meetings with the representatives of the Turkic republics there for three days.
This honorable and comprehensive policy of Turkey disturbs some. This is the reason why so much has come down on our country in the past 5 years. When they could not provoke different segments of society and drag our country into internal turmoil, this time they started to pressure from outside through terrorist organizations. We have disrupted this project with our cross-border operations. Now they are trying to squeeze us through the economy.
Of course, there are structural problems that Turkey needs to solve in the economy, we already know them and we are working to solve them. However, none of this is enough to explain the events we have experienced recently. As a matter of fact, some people do not hesitate to openly state that they are trying to corner our country over the economy. Hopefully, we will overcome this wave, I believe that our infrastructure is already capable of overcoming this, and it has that power. Both our economic management and other institutions of our state are taking the necessary measures. As a matter of fact, the resources at the disposal of our nation have been mobilized at this time. Our friends abroad have also started to support our struggle with very serious figures. I believe that this process will be the occasion for us to enter a new leap period both economically and politically. Everyone will see that Turkey is not without alternatives.
We are a country that builds all our relations on winning together, not on winning unilaterally. We have shown everyone we have worked with so far that acting together with Turkey is a profitable choice for everyone. However, no sentence can express the fact that a country with which we are strategic partners in NATO would approach a strategic partner like Turkey, which is among the top three in NATO, in this way.
And I say this very clearly: It is not possible to make us take a step back with such threats, with statements back and forth. We are the heirs of such a history that it is impossible to intimidate us with these threats. It means that they did not recognize this nation, but they will. We die one, we rise a thousand; That's our structure, that's our character. We do not have the slightest doubt that we are walking towards a bright future together with our citizens and hundreds of millions of friends and brothers. God is the helper of the righteous, and we believe that we are on the right path.
Dear friends;
A country without a goal is like a ship without a compass, it does not know which way to go. Turkey is a country with very clear goals. We announced our 2023 vision in 2011 and have been walking the same route since then. In the short and medium term, we firmly hold on to our 2023 targets. Every project we implement, every program we initiate, every work we build is aimed at bringing us one step closer to our 2023 goals. Believing is half the success. We wholeheartedly believe that we will achieve our 2023 goals. Not only that, but we are entrusting our visions of 2053 and 2071 to the next generations. We leave our youth and children a Turkey where they can realize their dreams on this infrastructure that we have established for 16 years and will hopefully carry forward.
We belong to a culture that equates despair with blasphemy. No one should resort in vain to ways that will darken the heart of our nation, discourage it, and raise doubts in its minds and hearts. Others may be disturbed by the fact that Turkey emerges from every struggle it enters not only standing but also winning. But no individual, no organization of this country has such a right.
Unfortunately, I also see that there are those who breathe the air of this country, eat its bread, drink its water, make the most of all the opportunities and look forward to Turkey falling on its face. We are witnessing that there are those who take their hostility towards our nation and the person they see as its representative to the extent of wishing for the disaster of the country. We are saddened by the fact that the media, knowingly or unknowingly, mediated this despicable act.
Media organizations all over the world, especially in Western countries, pursue the common interests of the states and societies in which they operate. This understanding is the unwritten rule of the media. Individuals and organizations that are hostile to their own country and society are excluded in the media as well as everywhere else, and they are left without a channel. It is imperative for Turkey to reach this maturity and this level of responsibility. Although we have come a long way in this direction recently, it is obvious that we still have a long way to go. I especially expect you here today to lead and contribute to this transformation of Turkey in the media. I see this determination and this belief in you.
With these feelings, I would like to congratulate our media members who were once again deemed worthy of the 2017 Media Oscars of the Radio and Television Journalists Association. I wish each of you success in your work. I greet you with love and respect. Stay healthy.

Their Speech at the Conquest of Anatolia Malazgirt 1071 Ceremony,2018-08-26,
Speech at the 10th Ambassadors' Conference,2018-08-13,"

President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Lajcak,
Distinguished Ambassadors,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and respect. On the occasion of the 10th Ambassadors' Conference, I am very pleased to welcome you at the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation.
I hope that the Ambassadors' Conference, which started yesterday, will be beneficial for our country, our nation and our diplomacy. I would like to welcome our guests who have visited and will visit our country from abroad, and I thank them in advance for their contributions to the conference. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and his team.
As you know, since the day I took over the presidency, we have been in an intense pace in domestic politics, especially in foreign policy. In accordance with the promise we made to our nation in the squares, we are trying to be a President who runs, runs and sweats, not sitting in his office. Just as we are closely interested in the issues of our 81 provinces, we are also making efforts to strengthen our country abroad.
In the past 4 years, as the President, we have made a total of 113 foreign trips in the context of official visits, study visits and summit meetings. We have sought ways to improve our cooperation with states with which we have had limited relations for many years, especially in Africa and Latin America. Likewise, we hosted 60 heads of state in our country, 50 of which were official visits. We have successfully hosted many high-level meetings such as the G-20, the World Humanitarian Summit, the D-8, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation summits in our country.
We have met with you, our esteemed ambassadors, several times both during the visit and on the occasion of these summits. However, the position of the Ambassadors' Conference is undoubtedly very different. This meeting, which has now become a tradition, has become an important platform where all our ambassadors meet under the same roof, hold consultations, and draw the general picture, route and horizon of Turkish diplomacy with a common mind. The conference is a very valuable opportunity for the status, future and success of our international relations. Of course, the difference between this year's meeting and the previous ones is that it is the first conference of the presidential system of government.
From the late Ãzal to Erbakan, from TÃ¼rkeÅ to YazÄ±cÄ±oÄlu to Demirel, Turkey has implemented this model of government, which has been dreamed of by many politicians who have left their mark on Turkish political life, thanks to democratic methods. Presidential system of government; It is the most suitable model for our history, culture, the expectations of our nation and, of course, the needs of our country. Our nation will never again witness GÃ¼neÅ Motel-like shameful bargains, experience excessive tensions, and have to grapple with instability arising from the system.
As a matter of fact, although the color of the ballot box was determined on the night of June 24, none of the previous discussions took place. By going to the polls, the nation determined both the executive and the legislature. Another achievement of our nation that should be applauded is that it has made such a critical change through the ballot box by completely operating the rules of democracy. A historic change that could have caused tensions, polarization, and even bloody conflicts in many parts of the world took place in Turkey in the atmosphere of a feast of democracy. In this respect, the April 16 referendum and the June 24 elections also show the level of Turkish democracy. Our democracy has matured with the difficulties it has overcome in 16 years and the tests it has successfully given, and it has reached a position that can be pointed out all over the world.
Dear ambassadors;
No matter how perfect the system is, the main factor that will determine its success or failure is the human being, the human element. No system that does not take people into account can be successful, and no model that does not motivate people can achieve its goals. Undoubtedly, the success bar of our new management system will be determined by people.
The smooth functioning of the presidential system of government is possible with the understanding and ideal unity we will establish at all levels of our state administration, from the bottom to the top. Everyone, from the civil servant to the supervisor, from the expert to the president, from the governor to the ambassador, has to work, produce and struggle for the ideal of a great and strong Turkey in full coordination. We will never tolerate institutional bigotry, conflicts, waste of time due to unwarranted concerns or lack of coordination.
The more important the supervisor is in the presidential system of government, the more important the personnel working in the presidency are. As critical as the duty of the governor is, so is the duty of the worker who controls the condition of our highways. As important as the role of the general manager is, the duty of our watchman, who sacrifices the night's sleep for the safety of our citizens, is just as important. As indispensable as the duty of our ambassador is, so is the duty of his staff working in different positions in the chancellery building. Regardless of their status, position or title, all cadres of our state organization should address the issue with the same sense of duty and the same dedication. We cannot allow anyone to clog or slow down the system, and it is the top managers of the institutions who will undoubtedly ensure this.
In the new period, our senior managers have much greater responsibilities than before. The responsibilities of you, our esteemed ambassadors, who represent our state and the Presidency in the countries where they are located, are getting heavier. Undoubtedly, as the sons of a great country and a great nation, you have successfully carried out your activities in the places where you have served so far, and you have taken part in many diplomatic activities in accordance with the foreign policy vision of our state and government. You have represented our thousands of years of state history and our foreign affairs tradition, which is an integral part of it, in the best way possible. You have carried our country's position to the top by using the subtleties of diplomacy in the countries and international organizations you have served. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your efforts on behalf of myself, my country and my nation.
In addition to the determined and resilient attitude of political will, you, our ambassadors, have also played a very important role in Turkey's international victories in recent years. A state that does not have a strong foreign service organization cannot be expected to be strong in international relations. At this point, our country has a foreign service staff that is truly competent, qualified, has internalized our ancient values, and closely follows the world and Turkey. I have known and know very well the strengths and abilities of our diplomats with their knowledge, self-confidence and many other outstanding qualities. Frankly, I believe that we have not used this squad effectively enough. Hopefully, we expect greater efforts and results from you in the new period.
Dear friends;
The visible village does not want a guide, we have such an example... The events we have experienced in the last few weeks have once again shown us the fact that Turkey is facing a siege in the economy as well as in other areas. It is clear that the attacks, which started with the Gezi protests, continued with the December 17-25 attempt, and moved to the next stage with the July 15 treacherous coup attempt, will continue for a while. We must also be prepared for different forms of these attacks targeting Turkey's independence, economic interests, national honor, dignity and personality.
The most important reason why we have been exposed to a series of operations in recent years, from terrorism to economic manipulations, is that we have adopted an uncompromising attitude towards our national interests. Since the moment we took office, we have considered the trust of the nation as our honor and have not cast a shadow on it, and we have not allowed politics to be under the command of tutelage again. We prevented social conflict scenarios by giving them back to back with our nation. In a short time, we deciphered the games established through terrorist organizations and prevented them. We did not consent to the terror corridor that was tried to be created around us under the pretext of fighting Daesh in Syria. We did not allow the sustenance of the poor and poor in the economy to be taken away by the financial lobbies.
It is the common determination of everyone who opposes that the developments in the exchange rate have no economic basis and are completely an attack on our country. There is a World Trade Organization in the world, when you look at the steps taken, does this have anything to do with the World Trade Organization's hopes? You can't say, 'I did it, it happened.' You can't be President as much as you want, no matter what you are, you can't go to bed at night and wake up in the morning and then say I put such and such a tax on iron and steel. There is a continuity, countries make all their calculations on this and take their steps accordingly. Will there be such a thing as trust between nations after that?
On the one hand, you will be a strategic partner, and on the other hand, you will shoot your strategic partner, yes, you will shoot yourself in the foot. On the one hand, you're going to be together in Afghanistan when everyone else is leaving, you're going to be together in Somalia, you're going to be together in NATO, and then you're going to get up and start shooting your strategic partner in the back. Is such a thing acceptable? And it is not possible for us to thank them.
What we are experiencing today has nothing to do with the 1994 crisis, the 2001 crisis or the 2007 crisis, we are really facing a completely different situation. Our Ministry of Treasury and Finance and other relevant economic units are taking the necessary steps against these attacks, and we will continue to do so. At the moment, there are steps that we are taking cautiously in the face of all these events, there are steps we will take, we have various plans. There is no economic explanation for where the exchange rate came from, and by saying 'the exchange rate was like this, the exchange rate was like this', 'we are sunk, we are finished'; There is no such thing.
Turkey's economic dynamics are sound, strong, in place, and God will continue to be in place. Whatever the reasonable level of the exchange rate, especially within the rules of the economy, will definitely settle there as soon as possible; Don't worry at all, be comfortable with it. As a country, we have never compromised on the rules of the free market economy in this process, and we will never do so. No one should give credence to rumors to the contrary.
There are many economic terror personalities on social media, there are studies done by them; Our judiciary has taken measures against them and is going against them. We are going after them with the CMB and where we catch them, we will apply the necessary penalties and sanctions to them. Because all this is treason, and we will not say to these treason networks, 'You can walk around with your hands and arms'. As I said yesterday, we have seen this game and we have demonstrated our stance by declaring once again that we will not compromise on our stance.
We continue on our way in the same way in other areas. What do they say? Here's 'Plan C, the truth behind Plan C, what is it? Confiscating capital.' It is not possible to understand where you read my memory records, whether they are fortune tellers or what. Did we say something like this, did we say something like that, on what basis do you say this? Unfortunately, these are indeed networks of betrayal, but we will not give a face to them. Whatever it takes, we will make those who make such speculations pay the necessary price. We not only prevented the attacks of the FETÃ treachery gang and separatist terrorist organization, which threatened our national security, but also took their lairs on their heads. We will put their lairs on their heads.
We have made Turkey the hope of hundreds of millions of people, including its own citizens. You know what the situation was in Turkey when we took office, and what is the situation we have reached today. The target of the increasing attacks on our country in recent years; It is never individuals, parties, institutions. There is no reasonable justification for such a hostile attitude in all areas against a state that has paid a significant price as a NATO ally. The aim here is not to eat grapes, but to beat the winegrower, and even, if possible, to knock out the winegrower's teeth and remove his liver; That's what they want to do.
The main issue here is to dissuade Turkey from its claims, goals and the search for rights and justice that it insists on. The aim of the games we are exposed to is to put our country under the yoke again and turn it into a paper tiger with a large size but a hollow paper, this is their problem. No matter what excuse it is made, no matter what garish concepts it is embellished with, this is the real goal of the operation. It is possible for us to come out of these attacks with the unity, solidarity and support of our nation.
Wherever you, our ambassadors, serve, your contribution to this effort is critical. In the words of the poet, we do not have the luxury of watching any development in this geography 'kneaded in the grip of the scorpion'. We have to break the molds, break the mold, change the habits. Either we will find a way, or we will find a way, there is no other way out of this. Hopefully, we will break this game together. We will face the operations against our country together. Together, we will nullify the slanders against our state. Together, we will defeat the scenarios targeting our nation. I invite you, our ambassadors, to work in this direction with the spirit of mobilization by making the best use of the energy, dynamism and opportunities brought by the presidential system of government. I believe that in the new period, you will carry out much more effective and more result-oriented works.
Dear friends;
As a nation, we do not owe our existence in this geography to someone's benevolence, grace and treat. Behind each of our victories is the sacrifice of our nation, the sweat of our brow, the blood, the soul and the struggle. Behind each of our successes is the courage of the heroes who rushed to the front by saying, ""Let Huda take all my life, / Let him not take me from my only homeland in the world"", and the dignified stance of the families who buried their pain in their hearts.
Regardless of their name, glory, size, and the role they have assigned to themselves, the bullies of the global system cannot reach out to our gains that have been paid for with blood. In particular, no one can impose lawlessness on us in the name of the so-called law. Turkey's foreign policy paradigm and red lines are clear. Our goal is to ensure the peace and security of our nation, as well as stability in our region and the world, starting with our close neighbors.
In the words of Gazi Mustafa Kemal, the founder of our Republic, ""Peace at home, peace in the world"" is the main priority of our foreign policy. Just as the mouth cannot be sweetened by saying 'honey, honey', peace cannot be established by saying 'peace, peace'. The way to achieve peace is to be active in every field, to be strong, and to be able to listen to one's word. You, our ambassadors, are at the forefront of the most important performers of an active foreign policy. You can't be at the table without being on the field. Of course, the gains on the field cannot be protected without being well represented at the table. Maintaining peace without a presence both on the field and at the table is no more than a dream.
See what the poet says: ""With this parable he finds the sentence duvel fevz-Ã¼ falÃ¢h, / Be ready, cenge, if you will, sulh-Ã¼ salÃ¢h."" Yes, the secret of the success of states lies in their readiness for war if they want peace. We are ready, let me tell you, we are ready with everything. We have demonstrated this in Euphrates Shield, we have demonstrated it in Afrin, and we will do so tomorrow. We act with this understanding in every field. The fact that real peace and tranquility in Syria can only be found in the places where our country provides security is the clearest expression of this statement.
We have acted with this understanding on many issues, from the issue of migration to the fight against terrorism, from humanitarian crises to stopping the bloodshed in our region, and we act with this understanding. We have taken responsibility for the refugee crisis, where European countries have condemned people to barbed wire fences by disregarding the principles they have defended for years. Since 2011, we have been hosting asylum seekers who come to our door to save their lives, regardless of their language, religion or ethnic identity, and we have been hosting them in accordance with human dignity. According to the calculations of the United Nations, the amount we spent on these people from our own budget amounted to 32 billion dollars. The European Union is still far behind its promise in terms of burden-sharing.
On the other hand, we see that racism, xenophobia and anti-Islamic rhetoric are increasingly taking European politics hostage. The fact that racist and xenophobic movements increase their votes in every election and become partners in the administration is a great threat to the whole world as well as our 6 million citizens living in European countries. Europe, which has experienced two major world wars in the last century, is the place where it should know best what the end of this business is. Turkey, where different cultures, beliefs and ethnic identities have lived together peacefully for centuries, is ready to take the initiative to overcome this difficult process.
Dear ambassadors;
We strive to implement our active and entrepreneurial foreign policy vision on global and regional issues. In particular, we base our stances on issues that concern us closely, such as Syria, Iraq and Iran, on principles, not on the problems in our bilateral relations. We have made progress in our relations with Russia as required by the interests of our country. We are working intensively with our brothers in the Gulf to encourage them from trade to diplomacy, from bilateral cooperation to the resolution of regional crises. The alignment of China's economic vision with our own economic goals opens up new and important opportunities in this field. We have been the eyes, ears and voices of humanity in order to reduce the persecution of Arakan Muslims and to ensure that they achieve their most basic rights. We continued our resolute opening policies in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa without slowing down.
We have carried our ties with the Turkic world, especially Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, much further. In the coming period, we will increase our visits to Central Asia and further develop and deepen our relations. We will intensify our struggle for the complete elimination of the FETÃ terrorist organization from our sister geographies. With the Balkans, with which we have historical, cultural and human ties, our efforts focused on stability and security continue increasingly, without excluding anyone. The Palestinian cause and the legal struggle of our Palestinian brothers and sisters are among our foreign policy priorities. We have never been silent about the harassment of the status of Jerusalem, our first qibla, and we will never remain silent.
Turkey is too big and important a country to be confined to a single region. With this understanding, we are trying to further deepen our cooperation with regional formations such as BRICS, the African Union, and ASEAN. In the coming period, we will increase our pace in every field, expand our horizons and strengthen our maneuverability. In order to achieve our 2023 goals, we will move up a gear even more, let alone give up on our projects.
In this process, you, our ambassadors, will also have very important duties. In the light of recent developments, you have great responsibilities, especially in terms of increasing our foreign trade and introducing the opportunities offered by the Turkish economy to international investors. I trust you, our ambassadors, who know best the challenges our country is facing.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I would like to thank each and every one of you for your visit to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation. I hope that the Ambassadors' Conference will be successful and productive. I wish you success in your duties. May God help us, stay healthy.

Their Speech at the July 15 Martyrs' Bridge Meeting,2018-07-15,
15 July Speech with Martyrs' Relatives and Veterans at the Dinner Program,2018-07-15,"

Dear relatives of July 15 and the martyrs of the fight against terrorism,
Dear veterans,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt affection. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your visit to the Presidential Complex, the home of the nation, and this veteran's place where 29 of our brothers and sisters were martyred on that fateful night.
I wish God's mercy on all the martyrs who lost their lives on July 15 and in our counter-terrorism operations. I wish patience and fortitude to you, the precious relatives of our martyrs. I wish our veterans good health and well-being. I pray for healing from my Lord to our veterans who are still undergoing treatment.
In fact, we would like to be together with all our martyrs' relatives and veterans at this meeting here today. Of course, this hall serves 2000-2500 people. But over time, we will hopefully have the chance to come together with our other brothers and sisters gradually. The struggle we are waging is so great that the large number of our brothers and sisters who lost their lives for this cause and were honored with veteranship did not allow this meeting to happen. Since 1984 alone, we have nearly 9,000 martyrs as soldiers, police officers, security guards and other public officials, and nearly 17,000 martyrs including civilians. The Qur'an's command and good news about our martyrs, ""Do not call those who are killed in the way of Allah dead, on the contrary, they are alive, but you cannot understand them"" is our greatest source of comfort. The number of our veterans injured at the level of disability is about half of our martyrs.
Of course, we have eliminated a large number of terrorists that cannot be compared with the number of martyrs and veterans. We neutralized 3,000 Daesh members in Operation Euphrates Shield alone, and nearly 4600 PKK and PYD members in Operation Olive Branch. This year, the number of terrorists we have neutralized in our operations within our borders and in Northern Iraq has approached 1400.
It is certainly not our choice to inflict such huge losses inside and outside our borders in the fight against terrorism. As a state and a nation, we are compelled to this struggle in the face of threats and attacks on our existence. We are forced to allocate our resources, which we should use to develop our nation and increase our welfare, to the fight against terrorism. We also know that this is one of the purposes behind the persistent unleashing of terrorist organizations on us, even though it is clear as day that they will never succeed.
In order to break this vicious circle, we have changed our counter-terrorism strategy in recent years. We no longer wait for the threat and danger to come to our doorstep. Instead of dealing with mosquitoes, we are making moves to drain the swamp itself. What we have experienced since the July 15 coup attempt has shown how correct our decision and determination was. Just like the PKK, just like DAESH, just like other terrorist organizations, the only goal of the FETÃ treachery gang is the unity, solidarity and future of our country.
As Turkey made its own decisions and moved towards the goals it set, we were able to overcome the obstacles we faced more and more easily. Until yesterday, we have overcome many things that were shown to us as a bogeyman, said to be undoable, unmanageable, unachievable, and we are coming. As we made progress in the field, we also had the opportunity to see the true faces and power of those who have made our country skate with dry threats for years. One by one, we diagnose and expose the traps set by those who cannot stand against us in the field through methods such as diplomacy, politics, economics and psychology. Hopefully, our job will be easier from now on.
We now have more opportunities to pay our moral debt to our martyrs and to be worthy of our veterans. With our new system of governance, we have blocked our decision-making and implementation mechanisms and taken away a trump card from those who direct Turkey as they wish. Today we look to our future with much more hope than we did yesterday. Hopefully, when we reach our 2023 goals, everything will be much different.
Brothers;
Learning from what we have experienced is the foremost condition of not repeating the same mistakes and not falling into the same traps. In fact, this feature already exists in the character of our nation. Let me tell you about a small incident that happened on July 15. On the night of July 15, when the nature of the coup attempt was understood, our YÃ¶rÃ¼k citizens in one of our villages in the north of Adana gathered and searched for a fellow citizen in Ankara. On the phone, they say to their fellow countrymen; 'GÃ¢vur is bombing Ankara, hang on, we are coming.' Yes, this is how our nation discovered the silhouette behind the coup attempt with its admirable wisdom and immediately took a stand.
There are many examples of this understanding in our history. 1 century ago, our nation, which continued to cultivate its land and do its job calmly in the face of many victories and defeats in the past, behaved in this way when the enemy relied on Ãanakkale. The father who wrote a letter to his son at the front; He expressed the view of our nation in Ãanakkale by saying, ""My son, either be a veteran and become a martyr and become a paradise"". This was the message of Åerife BacÄ±, who covered the cover that protected her son in our War of Independence over the artillery shell so that it would not get wet and spoiled, and who was martyred by freezing with her son in harsh winter conditions. It is with this understanding that countless stories of heroism have emerged in our counter-terrorism operations inside and outside our borders. Remember what our AydoÄan Pasha, who was martyred as a result of the crash of his helicopter in Åenoba last year, said:

""There were 90 of us that day.
Hungry, thirsty, sleepless.
With calloused feet
We were walking, carefree.
Greetings from the martyrs,
To all the right that are fighting,
My distances have become closer
By my faith, by my cause.""
Yes, we, as a country and a nation, have always carried out this struggle with our faith and our cause. Anyone who wants to discover the secret of our nation's heroism on the night of July 15 should look at this great struggle that has been going on for centuries. The magnitude of our nation's struggle for its independence and future will be better understood as time passes.
We look back at Sultan Alp Arslan, who opened the doors of Anatolia, Sultan KÄ±lÄ±Ã§ Arslan, who melted the Crusader Armies like candles in Anatolian lands, ErtuÄrul Gazi, who laid the foundations for a principality to become a world state, Osman Gazi, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han, who closed an era and opened an era by conquering Istanbul, AbdÃ¼lhamid-i Sani, who kept the Ottoman Empire alive at the most critical time with his political skills and reforms,  If we commemorate the Commander-in-Chief of our War of Independence, the founder of our Republic, Gazi Mustafa Kemal, the symbol of our democratic history, the martyred Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, and other heroes of our history with mercy and gratitude, the names of today's heroes will also be written in golden letters in history.
Brothers
We have fulfilled our religious, national and moral duty against terrorist organizations. It is the conscience of our nation and history that will make the real decision. We declared July 15 as the Day of Democracy and National Unity in order not to forget this important milestone we have experienced. As you know, every July 15 is a holiday for us and we will not let you forget it, we will not forget it. On the occasion of this commemoration day, every accounting to be made over the years will strengthen the bridge we have built from the past to the future.
In the light of the lessons we have learned from the events we have been experiencing in our country and in our region for a while, we will work harder to build a safer, stronger and brighter future for ourselves. Do not forget this: What comes after this FETÃ will not end. We will discover and dismantle all the cells that they enter. There's no stopping, we'll keep going.
We will appreciate our freedom more as we inherited it from our ancestors. We will act more decisively not to silence our prayers, not to have our flag lowered, to protect our homeland and to protect our state. Our nation is sick and tired of losing what it has gained in the field for centuries with its blood, life and wrist rights at the table with word games, diplomatic traps, heedlessness and even treachery; We will not lose. We are determined not to jeopardize what we have gained for the sake of the blood of our martyrs, the sacrifice of our veterans and the struggle of millions who have embarked on this path.
For this reason, we act in a way that reinforces our domestic successes abroad. We conduct our relations with all international organizations, from the European Union to NATO, with this understanding. We are trying to establish the widest possible basis of cooperation with the rising powers of the world in all geographies such as Russia, China, Africa, South America and Asia.
We amply respond to every step taken towards us on the basis of mutual benefit, not obligation and condemnation. One of the things that makes Turkey what it is is its fair, equitable, conscientious and moral stance towards the oppressed and the victims. There is no other country in the world that hosts as many refugees as our country and faces so few problems. We have all witnessed that a few hundred thousand asylum seekers in Europe have almost led to the overthrow of governments and the rise of racism. For those who do not look back on societies struggling with poverty, misery and even hunger while they themselves live in prosperity, we are happy to share what we have.
Do you know who is the country that gives the most support to the victims and oppressed in the world? Turkey. We rank first with $8 billion in aid. How does this happen? Thanks to my nation. Because our civilizational values require it. And thank God, we have left years and decades behind, and now there is a different Turkey. We have always extended our hand and we will continue to do so. Because, as members of a civilization that believes in the abundance of sharing, we will carry this position even further. May our Lord always keep us in the position of the hand that gives, not the one that takes.
We will further strengthen this position by developing our democracy and economy and firmly protecting our independence and future. July 15 is the symbol of this belief, this determination. Those who try to trivialize July 15 in their own minds are actually implicitly expressing their arrogance, hatred and hatred that they have accumulated in their souls against our country and our nation. Those who despise our fight against terrorism are in the same mood. No political, social, economic interests, no personal enmity can justify such a despicable act. We will never allow the cherished souls of our martyrs to be blessed or our veterans to be hurt.
Those who engage in such an act will first find us in front of them as a member of this beloved nation and as the President of the Republic of Turkey. Every martyr's family and every veteran is my own brother. I consider every wrong done to them as done to me, and I act accordingly.
Brothers;
We must raise our children with this awareness so that July 15 does not happen again. Every child who does not know their religion, nationality, language, homeland and state is a potential target of terrorist organizations. But I have a request for you; Martyrdom is one thing entirely, that office is very different. It is necessary to comprehend the delicacy and sensitivity of martyrdom and never allow martyrdom to be abused so that we do not disturb our martyrs in that position. Ignorance is not not being able to read and write, but not learning its history, culture and civilization. What Jonah says:
""Knowledge is knowledge
Knowledge is knowing yourself
You don't know yourself
Or nice to read
The meaning of the four books
It is obvious that it is in an elyph
You don't know the elf
This is nice to read
Yunus Emre says hoca
There are a thousand pilgrimages
Of all the best
It is to enter a heart""
Yes, we need generations that will know themselves, be straight like an elif, and enter our hearts. That's why we put education at the top of our priorities. We cannot achieve our goals with generations that have read in form, but remain barren in spirit. This place is very important:

""From thee my soul is divine, but it is aim,
Let not his hand touch the breast of my temple.
These adhans, whose testimony is the basis of religion.
Above my eternal abode must groan.""
We need generations that walk into the future with both knowledge and heart. Mothers, fathers; That's what we expect from you. Remember, you are the greatest teacher, governess, governess. Undoubtedly, the teachers in our schools are important, but you are the most important, it all starts with you. And in this way, we can prevent new July 15s and new terrorist organizations from attacking our body. Only in this way can we prevent the abuse of the values of our great religion and the sensitivities of our beloved nation. Only in this way can we look to our future with confidence. Commemorating July 15 and our victories in the fight against terrorism should lead us to this understanding. If we see today as nothing more than a dry gesture, we will have forgotten our main purpose.
Hopefully, I will go to Istanbul from here and we will also hold a second ceremony in Istanbul on the July 15 Martyrs' Bridge, yes, in the area where the Martyrs' Temple is located. And there we will meet our people again, we will make our address. And know that these ceremonies are held in 81 provinces today. We're going to make it permanent. What did we say? We will not forget July 15, we will not let it be forgotten.
With these feelings, on the occasion of July 15, Democracy and National Unity Day, I once again wish God's mercy on all our martyrs and patience to their relatives. I wish our veterans good health and well-being.
I would like to end my remarks with the well-known prayer of Arif Nihat Asya. Don't say that just because you keep reading this, this is the prayer, it is read:
""We are hoarse voices... Minarets,
Do not leave you without the call to prayer, O Allah!
Or call those who make honey over there,
O do not leave without a hive, O God!
Minarets without ridges... Heaven too
O God, do not leave you without a penchant!
A land steeped in Islam,
Do not leave without Muslims, O Allah!
Give us strength... Jihad square,
Don't leave you without a wrestler, O Allah!
Heaps of heroes,
Do not leave without a hero, O God!
Let us know how to resist the adversary;
Do not leave us lifeless, O God!
On the roads of tomorrow and the years,
Don't leave it without Ramadan, O Allah!
Scatter your orphaned flock,
O O do not leave you without a shepherd, O God!
You make us loveless, thirsty, airless
And do not leave you stateless, O God!
A land steeped in Islam,
Do not leave me without a Muslim, O Allah!""
Stay healthy.

Mr. Chairman of the Presidential Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Dear Madam,
Dear Wife,
Honourable Prime Minister, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Professors,
Dear students;
I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings at this meaningful meeting. I am very pleased to be back in Sarajevo after three years of longing. I would like to express my gratitude to the International University of Sarajevo for the honorary doctorate they have bestowed on me. Hopefully, I will carry this meaningful title with pride and pride for the rest of my life.
At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to congratulate the Ramadan of the entire Islamic world, especially you, my dear brothers and sisters in this hall. I pray that Allah will grant us and the Islamic Ummah a Ramadan in which we will realize peace, tranquility and peace.
Praise be to God, we have lived and are living today in Sarajevo in accordance with the blessings, spirit and meaning of Ramadan. Today, we first held our bilateral meeting with the Chairman of the Presidential Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, my dear brother Mr. Bakir Izetbegovic, and then our meetings between the delegations between the two countries. We discussed the cooperation projects between our countries with the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Denis Zvizdic, and the esteemed ministers of the Council of Ministers. From economy to education, from tourism to culture, we had the opportunity to consider our evaluations under all these headings as interlocutors.
As you know, the relations between Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina are progressing at an excellent level. Hopefully, we will carry these relations much further. Of course, some people are uncomfortable with the fact that Turkey's cooperation with the Balkan countries is so strong and so close. They are trying to question our country's presence in the Balkans without looking at their own past and the depth of their own relations. However, Turkey is also a Balkan country. We have hundreds of years of history in these lands, and we have artifacts scattered to the most remote corners. Here lies his son, the Conquerors. While visiting the grave of the wise man Aliya, we saw the Ottoman martyrdom in the cemetery next to that tomb, or rather the cemetery. We need to deal with TÄ°KA right away, and we need to make it sparkling all over again.
There are more Bosniaks in Turkey than in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and more Albanians than in Albania. Our brothers and sisters from the Balkans, the Caucasus and Turkestan live in almost every city of Turkey. While this is the case, countries that do not even border the Balkans are trying to portray Turkey as a hostile power in the Balkans. Of course, we know very well the main abdominal pain of these. We are aware that Turkey's efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Balkans hinder their plans and projects. They see the Balkans as their sphere of influence.
We, on the other hand, want this geography to achieve permanent stability and to be remembered with peace and stability, not tension. Hopefully, we will continue our struggle in the same way from now on. Together with our Bosniak brothers, we will continue to embrace Serbs, Croats, Albanians and Macedonians. Recently, we have taken very important steps in this direction and covered very important distances. Hopefully, in the future, we will build a Balkan spirit that rises by taking strength from differences.
Dear friends;
What we have experienced in the last few years has shown us how correct and at the same time how difficult the mission that Turkey has set for itself in foreign policy is. Advocating cooperation instead of tension, solidarity instead of fighting, sharing instead of exploitation, justice instead of oppression, and sincerely fighting for the maintenance of these countries is indeed a very laborious effort.
In fact, when it comes to words, almost everyone fills their tongues with these concepts. Today, those who undermine justice, peace, democracy, economic development and cooperation efforts in different corners of our region and the world are those who do not utter a single sentence without using these concepts. The only issue of these countries, which are called apostles of democracy at every opportunity and organize a human rights report card for everyone, is their own interests. There is no value that they will not give up for the sake of their interests, no principle that they will not violate. We all know how they do not speak out against massacres in many parts of the world, including the Balkans, in order to protect their interests. We also know very well what genocides they have signed for gold and diamonds in Africa. We know very well how terrorist organizations first turn a blind eye to the atrocities of the oppressors who carry out state terrorism and then destroy countries and societies under the pretext of fighting them.
Today, they have taken similar stances in the face of oppression in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya and most recently in Palestine. They don't even react properly to the brutal murder of 64 Palestinians, including 8-month-old babies and disabled people in wheelchairs. Aren't these the ones who killed 5 million people in Algeria? Aren't these the ones who killed hundreds of thousands of Rwandans in Rwanda? Aren't these the same people who killed hundreds of thousands of Libyans in Libya? To whom do they teach a lesson in humanity? We don't have any lessons to learn from them, but they have a lot to learn from us.
They are trying to stave off the injuries of 2,700 Palestinian civilians, some of them severely, with a few simple words of condemnation. We said to them; 'Give them to us and we will treat them.' They didn't, they said 'we can't'. Who are they? Egypt. Who are they? Israel. Who? Americas. You know, they respected the Declaration of Human Rights, you know, they always had a promise to follow the Declaration of Human Rights to the letter? No, don't believe them, they don't have such a problem. That is why this brother of yours says 'the world is bigger than five'. If we surrender the world to these five members of the United Nations Security Council, we will be burned. And if not five but one country says 'yes', it's okay, if it says no, it doesn't; Would such a thing happen? The world is no longer experiencing the conditions of the Second World War. They are now gone, now there is a new world, a new world is being built.
Therefore, 196 members of the United Nations General Assembly have to rebuild this new world. We see that too. As you know, there was a step we took on December 13 regarding Jerusalem. What did we do about it? We brought it to the United Nations, and it was immediately voted on in the United Nations. As a result of the vote, what did 128 countries say to 9 countries, including the United States? They said no, we refuse. And 129 countries that know America and its supporters, whose names I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, it is not possible to call them countries, they are at best towns. We know the name of an America, we know the name of an Israel, and we know the name of an Israel, because it is so cruel. No.
Like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, when they close their eyes to Israel's violent policies, it is as if they assume that they never happened. They believe they can manage this process by keeping their own comfortable world safe. However, it is impossible to ignore the truth. Today, even if you do not admit it, Palestinians continue to be the target of bullets, and the cries of mothers who have lost their children and children who have lost their mothers continue to rise. Even if you turn your back, millions of people in the world today are struggling to survive in the grip of hunger and famine. Tyrants who constantly pat themselves on the back make the world uninhabitable for all of us. That's why we say; Long live Hell for the oppressors. Even if they don't want to see, hear or accept it, all of these injustices and cruelties are happening in different corners of the world right now.
Dear friends;
What we have to do is to fight courageously for the manifestation of truth and justice instead of falling into the pit, being offended, and retreating into our own shells. Being angry with the darkness does not and will not benefit anyone. The point is to light a ray of hope that will pierce the darkness. For this, the place we should look should not be the size of those in power, but the faith in our own hearts, faith. We cannot look to our future with hope by succumbing to the threats of monuments of arrogance and remaining silent about the spiral of violence that has drenched our region in blood. Hazrat Ali (r.a.) said, ""Do not bow down before injustice, then you will lose your honor along with your right."" Regardless of their beliefs or religions, people with conscience and personality need to raise their voices and express their reactions in the clearest way, let alone bow down in the face of injustice.
As Turkey, we have been trying to do this for the last 16 years. Instead of watching the events affecting our geography from the stands, we are working for a solution by using all the means at our disposal. We pursue an active and enterprising foreign policy without relying on the false comfort of nepotism.
The Extraordinary Islamic Summit we held in Istanbul last Friday is one of the examples of these efforts. We organized this summit at the level of leaders only 72 hours after the illegal decision of the American administration and the Israeli massacres. Thus, we showed our reaction in the face of persecution. We have also shown a strong will to protect our holy places, especially Jerusalem. As the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we have taken many decisions in the economic, diplomatic, commercial and political fields that will especially hurt those who shed the blood of the Palestinians. We have once again declared that we will not allow Jerusalem, the first qibla of Muslims and the holy city of the three heavenly religions, to be occupied by Israel.
The extraordinary summits on Jerusalem held on both December 13 and May 18 are the will of the Islamic world's determination on this issue. These summits are also signs that the Islamic world is slowly beginning to shake off the dead soil that has been sprinkled on it. I see this as a very hopeful step for our future. I believe that we will show solidarity on our other problems, from Syria to Iraq, from Islamophobia to cultural racism.
Dear brothers and sisters;
Without a qualified, well-trained, value-assimilated, open-minded and vision-provoking human resource, most of these efforts are doomed to fail. We rely on our young people to build a prosperous future for our country, our nation and our brothers and sisters, as is the case today in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With this understanding, we show great sensitivity to the education and training of young generations. We strive to raise not only our own children but also the young people of our friends in different corners of the world in accordance with our goals. Today, 17 thousand students from 160 countries of the world are studying at undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels in our country with Turkish scholarships. In addition, 115 thousand students from all over the world receive education in Turkish universities with their own means.
So far, 860 of our students have returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina after graduating within the scope of Turkey scholarships and started to serve their countries. On the other hand, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkology departments operate in universities in Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica. Nearly 500 students receive education in these departments. Yunus Emre Institute, which introduces Turkey, Turkish, Turkish culture and art to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has branches in Mostar and Foynitsa. Yunus Emre Institute, which has approximately 6 thousand students participating in its certified courses in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has also started to provide Turkish as an elective foreign language in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the scope of the 'My Choice is Turkish Project'. The project, which started with approximately one thousand students in 43 schools in the 2011-2012 academic year, reached 8243 students in 150 schools this year. We carry out these activities with the support of our non-governmental organizations, foundations and associations as well as the institutions of our state.
The International University of Sarajevo, under whose roof I am honored to be today, is one of the most beautiful fruits of this vision. More than 1500 Turkish university students are studying in various cities, mainly at the international University of Sarajevo. Sedef Foundation, the founder of the International University of Sarajevo, also provides services to our youth with a primary and a secondary school in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In addition, the Turkish Maarif Foundation has thankfully completed its establishment process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our foundation will take action in a short time to provide educational support to students from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We consider the educational mobilization of these institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be of critical importance in terms of the fight against FETÃ. As you know, with the treacherous coup attempt attempted in our country on July 15, 2016, the dirty face of FETÃ, which we have been fighting for a long time, has been clearly revealed and our rightness has been proven. I will never forget the resolute and sincere solidarity shown by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the person of Mr. Bakir Izetbegovic, President of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while many countries remained silent during the coup attempt.
As Mr. Bakir Izetbegovic stated, FETÃ is trying to survive as an octopus that has wrapped its arms around every aspect of society, and education is one of these areas. We know that FETÃ is trying to maintain educational institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina under different names and is trying to take refuge under the protection of various countries. In order to prevent these schools from harming Bosnia and Herzegovina in the future, we ask our brothers and sisters from Bosnia and Herzegovina to close FETÃ's schools, and we consider it our duty to offer alternatives to Bosnia and Herzegovina students. As you know, there were schools right next to you, now what? They hoisted the British flag; that's how Turkish they are. They have nothing to do with Turkishness, they are just another nation. Both the Turkish Maarif Foundation and the Sedef Foundation will meet these needs with the educational centers they have opened and will open.
Dear students;
Political and economic relations between Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina promise a bright future. This development gradually increases the need for young people who know the languages of both countries and are active in all areas of life. We live in a period where societies are getting closer and closer to each other, and the importance of information, information and technology is increasing exponentially. My advice to you, young people, who are studying in such a beautiful country and such a distinguished institution like Bosnia and Herzegovina; It is that you are very curious, do a lot of research, speak at least two foreign languages comfortably, and educate yourself in the best way.
Look, now the Parliament is open to you and you can easily come and get the chance to be a member of parliament there. When we came, you know, 30 was the age to be elected; But now we've reduced it to 18. And we want to prepare a young, dynamic parliament. Do not be satisfied with education at school, you should also make an effort to learn the history of our country and humanity and the events taking place in the world. It should be our motto not to get tired of working, not to get tired of learning, to try to understand the other person and to empathize. As the late Necip Fazil said, ""It is necessary to work like ants in order to leave works like giants.""
As I end my words with these thoughts, I greet all of you with my heartfelt affection and wish you success in your education life and beyond. May God help you, stay healthy.
"
Their Speech at the 6th UETD General Assembly,2018-05-20,"

Chairman of the Presidency Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, my dear brother Mr. Bakir Izetbegovic,
Dear Madam,
Honourable Ministers,
Dear President and executives of the Union of European Turkish Democrats,
Dear brothers and sisters living in Europe,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon all of you, all of us, assalamu alaikum and mercy and blessings.
I bring you the greetings of our 81 provinces and 81 million citizens. I would like to thank each and every one of you for your love, enthusiasm and kindness.
Union of European Turkish Democrats UETD 6. I pray to God that the Ordinary Assembly will be instrumental in good deeds. I would like to express my gratitude to all our brothers and sisters who have served our citizens in Europe under this roof at UETD since its establishment. I wish success to our friends who will take part in our congress from the Almighty Mevla.
At a time when the glorious European countries that claim to be the cradle of democracy have failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown that it is a democrat in essence, not in words, by providing us with the opportunity to come together here. True friendship, true brotherhood, true comradeship is evident these days. With this step, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven that our centuries-old brotherhood still continues and will continue in the future.
The day before that wise man ascended to the hereafter, I had landed here on a remarkable journey and visited him in the hospital. And he had a piece of advice, he said, ""This land is the Son of Fatihan."" And he said, ""My son, take care of this place."" We have never thought of Bosnia separately, we have continued on this path together with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will continue to do so.
Brothers;
Europe is not a place for us, our ancestors have been Europeans for a thousand years. The first thing our ancestors who came to Anatolia did was to cross the Bosphorus and move towards Europe. In particular, the direction of the Ottomans has always been Europe, except for force majeure. Although we retreated to Thrace after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, we always maintained our relations with Europe.
In order to meet the labor needs of European countries, which suffered great human losses in the Second World War, we set out on the roads of Europe this time as expatriates. It has been more than 65 years since we went to Europe for employment purposes. In addition to those who went to work, there was also a tendency to Europe due to coups and pressures in our country. The first generation that went to Europe as a harpoon-like lad gradually took their family with them, their children were born there, and then they had their children. The first generation began to give way to the second generation, the third generation, and even the fourth generation.
The first arrivals had a dream of working for a while and building a future for themselves in Turkey with the earnings they earned, for which we called them 'expatriates', because one day they would come back. Of course, there were those who came, but a significant number of them also settled in Europe. That is why we no longer call our brothers and sisters living on this continent 'expatriates', but Europeans. Europe, which was a 'bitter homeland' yesterday, has now become a new homeland.
Our ancestors, who came from Central Asia a thousand years ago and made Anatolia their home, did not stop there, they fixed one foot on Anatolia and spread over a wide geography from Europe to North Africa with the other sober. Today, more than 6 million of our brothers and sisters from Anatolia live in Europe. The number of people of Turkish origin living in North Africa and the Middle East is estimated to be over 20 million. We know that in many places from Western Thrace to Eastern Europe, our brothers and sisters, whom we left a century ago, are still living their lives.
We have been through a lot since those days when we passed through the Danube in a 'joyful way like children'. Especially in the last 2 centuries, we have suffered great losses, although even those who are left behind are a great treasure in themselves. We are determined to protect this treasure, a part of which is created by you, like our eyes. No matter how much someone tries their best to separate us, I underline that they will not succeed.
Brothers;
As you know, after the establishment of the Republic, during the single-party CHP period, there was an attempt to break the ties of our nation with its history. In the textbooks of our childhood, we would learn about the civilizations that lived in Anatolia thousands of years ago, and then suddenly we would come to the 20th century, and the thousand-year period in between was almost ignored. Even the Seljuk and Ottoman mentions in history lessons were explained to us as if they were an aphakic subject. We have destroyed this understanding, which ignores the thousands of years of accumulation of our civilization and history. We have reunited our nation with its past, culture and values.
One of the things we emphasize is that you, the European Turks, are you. I would like to repeat once again the following points that I have expressed in every meeting with you: Take the citizenship of the countries you live in, do not say that you will not take it, if they give it, take it. In countries that allow dual citizenship, there is already no problem. We have developed formulas for countries that have different applications in this regard, including the blue card, where you can use your rights in Turkey without any loss.
Brothers;
Take care of your religion and language very well, when you lose them, you will be lost. In addition to teaching your children their mother tongue in the best way possible, try to ensure that they receive the best education in the country they are in. Those who do not speak Turkish well cannot learn, speak or use German, French, English, in short, other languages well. Of course, in the meantime, we cannot put Bosnian aside.
We have established an organization called the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities, exclusively in response to the questions of our citizens living abroad. We have increased the number of our embassies and consulates around the world, facilitating our citizens' access to the state. 19 years ago, we had 12 embassies around the world, thank God, this number has increased to 41 now, I hope there will be no country without an embassy. We have radically changed the understanding of work in our embassies and consulates in accordance with the transformation in the management mentality of the state in Turkey.
By using the possibilities of technology, we have ensured that our citizens abroad can carry out their transactions electronically as much as possible. In addition to customs, we have also set up ballot boxes in our foreign representative offices so that you can easily exercise your right to vote, which is the most basic element of democracy. Now they are talking; Those before us, why didn't you do it, why didn't you succeed? We came and took care of it, but we were defending the democratic rights of our nation. I hope you will benefit from this application for the 5th time on June 24th. In the light of the experience we have gained in every election, we develop and establish this system. We have facilitated, simplified and reduced the costs of many transactions from military service to title deed, from passport fees to diplomas. We have always supported the activities of our citizens living in Europe under the umbrella of non-governmental organizations, and UETD has made great efforts in this regard.
In terms of education and training, whether in the countries they live in or in our own country, we have provided facilities to our children in every field from university entrance to housing. Currently, 4 thousand of our children who have completed their education abroad are studying at state universities in our country. Again, we brought thousands of our children abroad to our country with the programs we organized, and ensured that they could see their history, culture and civilization closely. We have eliminated an important problem by increasing the period of our citizens who come to Turkey with their vehicles in the countries they live in to use them within our borders to 2 years. Apart from these, we serve our citizens in many other areas. Of course, there are deficiencies, there are problems, and we will solve them quickly.
Brothers;
Now, I would like to share with you the new good news with the new services we will provide to our citizens in the diaspora: We are diversifying our project support for our children abroad to learn our mother tongue, Turkish. In this context, we will encourage our children to learn their mother tongue, Turkish and our culture with weekend schools. We are doubling the quotas in universities reserved for our young people in the diaspora.
Another important work we will take is the steps we will take to simplify public services for our citizens abroad. For example, a few weeks ago, our citizens will be able to pay all fees related to consular procedures directly at the consulates general with a bank card. With this application, we prevent our citizens from paying commissions unnecessarily by eliminating the bank.
Applications have started to be received for the recognition of divorce decisions by the process to be carried out by our consulates general without the need for another place. The era of filing a lawsuit again in Turkey, waiting for years and paying thousands of euros is over. Not only did we reduce military service with foreign currency from 6,000 euros to a thousand euros; We will soon solve the problems of people over the age of 38 who have not been able to apply for military service with foreign currency.
We are establishing a coordination board for overseas citizens in order to make the coordination of services carried out by our different institutions much more effective and faster. We will establish an advisory council for foreign citizens, the secretariat of which will be carried out by our Presidency for Turks Abroad, in the consular regions. In the new period, we will recommend the establishment of a permanent commission within the Turkish Grand National Assembly under the name of the overseas commission. In order to strengthen the Turkish local media abroad, we will pave the way for the Press Advertisement Institution to place advertisements and advertisements in the Turkish media abroad. The protection of personal data will be carried out in accordance with national and international law, and most importantly, in the interests of our citizens.
Dear brothers and sisters;
With all this, no one should be fooled by dirty propaganda on this subject and should not worry. TRT TÃ¼rk will be restructured and will offer a wider range of services to our citizens abroad. Another important good news is that our citizens who retire from abroad can work part-time in our country. Immediately after the elections, we start to take the steps you expect in this regard. As you can see, the President of the Republic of Turkey, ministries, embassies, consulates and all institutions are with you. Wherever a citizen in the world is in trouble, it is our duty to be there with all our means.
Brothers;
There is strength in unity. The more united the European Turks are among themselves, the stronger they become. The fact that communities that are much smaller than the number of our citizens are much more active in politics, economy, civil society and cultural activities is due to the unity and solidarity among them. If some European countries are able to exhibit attitudes that reach the level of rudeness towards us and our country today, it is because of the disunity of the Turks there. They deliberately divide us by calling us Turks, Kurds, Circassians, Sunnis, Alevis, so that we do not reveal our real power. They don't just divide us, they pit us against each other.
When we go to European countries, we encounter crowds of people confronting each other with Turkish flags on one side of the pavement and rags of organizations on the other. But despite all this, I have a speech at Chatham House in England last week, and what is interesting at the moment of my speech is this: I have a sister from the Black Sea, she has a Turkish flag in her hand, and PKK terrorists tried to take the Turkish flag from her, but she was my sister-in-law, she was Nene Hatun, she was Åerife BacÄ±, and she did not lose the Turkish flag to that scoundrel in that dishonest way. These scoundrels can't even afford our sisters, let alone deal with men. We must be aware of the tricks of those who have put us in this situation and put an end to it.
It is time for everyone who has come from Turkey to unite around common values, regardless of their origin, sect, profession or political preference. This unity is for the benefit of everyone, it is in the interest of everyone. Those who easily violate our rights and laws by keeping us in small groups will surely behave very differently when they see a Turkish society with one heart and one body in front of them. The fact that people of Turkish origin show the greatest hostility to our country in the parliaments of European states shows how far the trap set against us has reached. Hopefully, we will break this game together.
I ask you to take an active role in the political parties in the countries where you live. You, not those who betrayed our country, should take part in those parliaments. Turkish society has this power, as long as we do not put small differences between us as an obstacle to walking towards big goals. When we act in accordance with the command of our Prophet (S.A.W.), ""There is mercy in unity and torment in separation"", we will see that our path will open up by itself.
I call out to our brothers and sisters all over Europe, now is the time to be fully alive. Are we ready to be one? Are we ready to be bigAre we ready to be alive? Are we ready to be brothers?) Are we all ready to reach the place we deserve in Europe? Brothers; What does AÅÄ±k Veysel say?
""Allah is One, the Prophet is the Truth
Lord, the absolute,
Let go of what is the self,
Let me tell you, it's time,
Kurds, Turks, Circassians
Always Adam's son, daughter,
Together with the martyrs, veterans,
Is there anything wrong and where?""
Yes, I hope that we will embrace again with all our brothers and sisters, with whom we were martyrs and veterans yesterday, in Europe as well as in our country, and we will start to walk towards common goals. My brother Bakir has just stated, we fought together with our Bosnian brothers in Ãanakkale, we gave martyrs there. This is the point, it is very important to catch this again, to be the son of Fatihan .
Brothers;
Turkey is preparing for a historic election on June 24, and Bosnia is preparing for a historic election on December 7. On June 24, we will not only elect a president and deputies, but we will also make the choice of the next century of our country.
As the Chairman of the AK Party, as the Prime Minister and as the President, you are the closest witness of what we have experienced and what we have done in the last 16 years. Sometimes it is difficult for us to comprehend the real dimensions of the events we live in. I believe that you have the opportunity to see and evaluate what is happening in our country from abroad in a much more comfortable way. Because you know much better what changes in Turkey every time you come. Although some of the presidential candidates do not know what is going on in Turkey, I give them you as their address.
Because a good word is polite, ""ol mahis who drink the sea, they do not know the sea."" These presidential candidates living in our country now are like fish in the sea, they do not understand. Only when you take them from the sea and throw them on land, then they understand the value of the sea. Was there Marmaray yesterday? Was there Eurasia yesterday? Was there Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge yesterday? Was there an Osman Gazi Bridge yesterday? All these are huge investments that have just been made and we will continue to do so. And in Turkey, which has 25 airports, thank God, we have added 29 more airports, there are 54 airports at the moment. Now, my brothers and sisters in different parts of Europe get on at once, and when they land in their city, they go home half an hour from there. Why? Modern Turkey is what this is for.
Every incident that our country has experienced, especially in the last 5 years, is full of exemplary documents for eyes that see, ears that hear, tongues that speak the truth, and hearts that have a conscience. We all went through a process that started with the Gezi protests, continued with the December 17-25 police-judiciary coup attempt, turned into a bloody situation with terrorist incidents, and betrayal was revealed in all its nakedness with the July 15 coup attempt. This was such a period that there were moments when we had difficulty in telling the truth even to those closest to us, even to our friends with whom we had walked for years.
It was our nation that saw the trap set for our country best, and I believe you are aware of this. Those who seem to be directed at us, but actually aim to bring our nation and state to their knees, and especially to bring our independence and future to their knees, licked their palms with the upright stance of our nation in these attacks. Turkey is fighting a second War of Establishment with its struggle in this period. What did we do in the War of Independence? Let's put it in Mehmet Akif's quote:
""A wall of steel armor surrounds Garb;
I have a bosom full of faith.
Nation, do not be afraid! How can he stifle such faith,
'Civilization!'
Friend! Don't let the scoundrels come to my land;
Shield your body, stop this wanton incursion.
The days that God has promised you will be born...
Who knows, maybe tomorrow, maybe sooner than tomorrow.""
Yes, we, relying on our faithful zeal, shielded our bodies to prevent scoundrels from invading our homeland. First, we stopped the coup plotters, terrorists and their secret and open supporters. Then, with Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch Operations, we pierced the terror corridor that was tried to be created along the southern borders of our country. Hopefully, we will continue to move forward with determination on this path that we have opened with new gains soon. We will not stop until we destroy the last terrorist who pointed a gun at our country, this is how it should be known.
Brothers
Of course, we have not only fought against terrorist organizations and the forces behind them, but we have also taken steps to bring our country to a new system of governance where it can cope with its current problems more easily and look to its future with confidence. We are fully implementing the new administrative system, which was decided by the constitutional amendment adopted by our nation in the April 16 referendum, after the June 24 elections. As we try to take Turkey forward, some people are constantly trying to stop it and even push it back. Knowing that they could not do it alone, they even gave up their political privacy and went so far as to share everything from their MPs to their constituents.
Those who would not have greeted each other if they had met on the road under normal circumstances, joined hands and stood in front of us. We, on the other hand, are walking together with our nation today, as we have always done for 16 years. We see continuing this journey together with everyone who is local and national as a requirement of our responsibility towards our nation. That is why we formed the People's Alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party, and the Great Unity Party joined us, and this is how the People's Alliance entered the elections at the moment. Our door is open to everyone who is local and national.
As European Turks, you supported us in the presidential election, the November 1 elections, and the April 16 referendum. Now, once again, we need your support for the June 24 elections. Now I ask you, give you such an answer that it can be heard from all over Europe, from Germany to France, from Belgium to Austria and the Netherlands, are you ready to march with us on June 24 against the evil alliance established to drag Turkey into chaos, uncertainty and instability again?
Are you ready to elect us to the presidency with a record number of votes in the presidential election and to remove our deputies with an overwhelming majority in Parliament?
Are you ready to implement the presidential system of government in a strong way and bring Turkey to its 2023 goals? Are you ready to protect your independence and future? Are you ready to give a slap to terrorist organizations and their domestic and foreign collaborators? Are you ready to show the power of European Turks to the whole world?
Mashallah, this voice rising from Sarajevo is the harbinger of our victory on June 24. I know you're so tired, get up if you want. You know our Rabia, don't you? One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state... May God not deprive us of these. May God bless you all. May your path and fortune be clear. May He protect us all from accidents and troubles.
Once again, the 6th edition of the UETD. I wish the Ordinary Board to be beneficial. I especially ask you to convey my greetings, respect and affection to all our brothers and sisters in the places you go. I say with good health, I entrust you to Allah.
"
Their Speech at the Rally in Support of Jerusalem,2018-05-18,"

Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
Today, Istanbul YenikapÄ± is experiencing a different, exceptional day. As the voice of hundreds of millions, whose hearts beat for Jerusalem, whose anger swells for Jerusalem, whose hearts burn for Jerusalem, I salute all my brothers and sisters who are in YenikapÄ± today with my heartfelt feelings. On the occasion of the Extraordinary Meeting of the Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, I greet our guests who visited our country and are among us now, with love and respect.
Brothers;
I would like to pay my respects to the Chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, Mr. BahÃ§eli, the Chairman of the Great Unity Party, and the esteemed representatives of our political parties, who participated in our rally by saying ""The cause of Jerusalem is the cause of all of us"". I send my greetings from Istanbul to everyone who follows us through the media in our country, region and all over the world.
From here, I salute all my brothers and sisters in Mecca, where our Kaaba is located, in Medina, the relic of our Prophet (S.A.W.), in Jerusalem and Gaza, who stand tall, even though their eyes are teary, their hearts are wounded, and they are mourning for their martyrs.
I especially salute our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are fighting against Israeli oppression with the power of faith in their hearts. I wish God's mercy on our martyrs who were brutally murdered while defending their faith and homeland. I wish a speedy recovery to our veterans who were injured in this blessed struggle. I would like to express my gratitude to the oppressed Palestinian people who have undertaken the task of protecting the dignity of humanity and Muslims. Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa blessings.
Brothers;
You know, Jerusalem is not just a city. Jerusalem is a symbol, a test, Jerusalem is the Qibla. If we cannot protect our first qibla, we cannot look with confidence to the future of our last qibla. To be clear; The Islamic world has failed in the Jerusalem test. Not only the Islamic world, but also the whole humanity has failed in the test of Jerusalem.
Brothers;
As one of our poets said; ""First, they occupied Jerusalem in our hearts. We lost the war first in ourselves."" As Muslims, we have been unable to properly resist the oppressor since Jerusalem was occupied. For 4 centuries, the Ottoman Empire ruled Jerusalem as a city of peace, tranquility and well-being for members of other religions. The Ottomans, who were on the defeated side in the First World War, had to leave Jerusalem like many other geographies. Since that day, Jerusalem has not seen the face of peace. The city's respectful structure for all religions quickly deteriorated. Along with Muslims, the holy places of Christians also came under threat from Israel. Brothers and sisters, what does the poet say?
""O Jerusalem, O city of sorrows
O thou who has great tears flowing from thy eyes
Who will stop the enemies
That which swoops upon you, O pearl of religions
Who will wipe the blood from the walls...""
Since then, the traces of blood have never been erased from the walls of Jerusalem and the land of Palestine. According to the United Nations resolution in 1947, Jerusalem was to be an international city with a special status. This decision only resulted in the rapid occupation of Palestine and the forced liquidation of the region's thousands of inhabitants. The United Nations, which remained silent about the occupation of Jerusalem in 1967, has tacitly become a partner in this oppression by simply watching all the unjust, illegal, unscrupulous and immoral actions carried out by Israel. Do you understand why I say 'the world is bigger than five'? Otherwise, you will see nothing but cruelty in the world that is condemned between the lips of an America. What do we say to him? Long live Hell for the wicked. Today, the United Nations, which has not taken an effective stance against the step taken by the United States, has dealt another blow to the already eroded legitimacy ground.
The burning of Masjid al-Aqsa by one or a group of Jews 2 years after the occupation of Jerusalem by Israel should have been the last straw. They are Zionists, and we are facing a struggle for Zionism. Unfortunately, even such a catastrophe was not enough to bring Muslims to their senses. I distinguish between Zionists and Jews. The real struggle is with Zionism, with the Zionists. And their hostility towards Muslims is unforgivable. The Prime Minister of Israel at the time expressed his feeling on the day of this fire very interesting: ""I thought that Muslims would come to Jerusalem from all sides, I could not sleep until the morning because of fear. But it was morning and nothing happened. That's when I realized that we can do whatever we want."" It's sad, but that's our situation.
Brothers;
Of course, along with all this, my friends just said, both Mr. BahÃ§eli, Destici, Mr. Yildirim, and Kahraman, they also said it, but it is good, 'et repeatu ahsen velev kane one hundred and eighty'... (Again, even if it's a hundred and eighty times is good.)
""I saw Masjid al-Aqsa in my dream,
She was like a child and she was crying.
I arrived and laid my forehead on the threshold,
It was as if an underground river was cascading.
I keep my eyes on the roads,
Where are my brothers, a voice said,
The first qibla is that of my great Prophet,
Has everyone forgotten that?""
Yes, our languages have not forgotten Masjid al-Aqsa, Jerusalem and Palestine; But it is obvious that we cannot go beyond being a spectator with their hands tied.
Brothers;
Israel has been doing what it wants since 1947 and is going on its way with the same recklessness today. We cannot ignore these facts. With the latest decision taken by the United States, the privacy of Jerusalem has once again been extended. Increasingly, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is being desecrated by the boots of radical Zionists. The Hebron Mosque is still occupied, and we Muslims do not and cannot do anything but condemn.
However, there are examples of how Muslims have made Jerusalem a land of faith. Hazrat Umar conquered Jerusalem without bleeding anyone's nose. But behind Hazrat Umar there was a huge army ready to give his life for this cause if necessary. Centuries later, the Crusaders, who gathered huge armies to march on Jerusalem, entered Anatolia as 600 thousand people and despite all the brutality they exhibited, they could only cross the Taurus Mountains as 100 thousand people. The Seljuk beys, who waged this great struggle against them, did not fear either the number of the enemy or the suliet behind them.
When the army consisting of the remnants of the Crusaders entered Jerusalem, they massacred all of them, leaving no one in the city, Muslim or Jewish. When Saladin reconquered the city, he allowed everyone who surrendered to leave. The struggle of this great commander, who considered it his duty to sleep in his house while Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque, the house of Allah, were in captivity, became a symbol of faith and courage and resistance against oppression.
Similar events took place in the later Crusades. But there was no hesitation, never, when the other side marched on Jerusalem with cruelty, brutality and slaughter; The Muslims defeated them with the strength of their faith and wrists, but they did not harm any innocent person. What is the last major example of this wave of attacks? Canakkale. Although they tried to close our horizon with steel armored walls in Ãanakkale, praise be to God, our nation stopped this treacherous influx by shielding its chest full of faith.
Notice that in all of these examples, while the oppressors attacked with all their might, Muslims were not content with just praying and shedding tears, they believed in the promise of Allah and fought with all their might, with all their means, regardless of the number, weapons and technology of the forces they opposed, saying that ""consent to oppression is oppression"".
""Friend! Don't let scoundrels come to my land.
Shield your body, stop this wanton incursion.
The days that God has promised you will be born...
Who knows, maybe tomorrow, maybe sooner than tomorrow.""
Jerusalem is what Ãanakkale is to us. A struggle in which hearts, wrists and souls are put on the line will surely result in victory. When we look at what we are missing today, this is what we see. As long as we do not add the strength of our hearts and wrists to our prayers and tears, we will not stop the oppressor. Because the tyrant who does not know the right and the law does not understand words, words and advice. Power is the only language that the immoral oppressor, who suppresses the fear within him by constantly raising the bar of oppression, understands power.
If the whole world, all Muslims, unite and stand against this oppression, believe me, the support of the lobbies on which it relies will not be enough for Israel to continue its recklessness. Brothers and sisters, do not forget this: Our national poet Akif described the situation we are in beautifully;
""After years and centuries of sleep,
Shake off the atrocities in your neighborhood and destroy them!
See, the heavens are awake, the earth is awake;
Sleeping while the world is awake is a farce!
Alas, you are the one who is the malady to these disgraces.
O ignorance, this nation is falling upon you,
Thou hast made it so that there is no religion left, no honour!
O black nightmare that has descended upon Islam,
O Prophet of God, he must first kill you:
You are the hand that gives us the upper hand over our enemies!""
It is incumbent on all of us to get the Islamic world out of this situation. Undoubtedly, the biggest responsibility in this regard falls on today's Muslims, and this is where it falls. Yenikapi Square is no stranger to this. Were we here on August 7th? Were we here for the reckoning of July 15th? Remember, this space, yes, will always be our gathering place, our meeting place. First of all, we will ensure our unity, solidarity and unity among ourselves so that we can stand strong against the oppressor as necessary.
I will be frank that the more hostile Muslims are to each other, the more intolerant they are, and even the more unscrupulous they are in the conflicts, quarrels and disagreements among themselves, the more wimpy, discouraged and cowardly they appear towards their enemies. I don't know, is my detection wrong? So let's do what is necessary. So much so that we are not even able to prevent the project terrorist organizations that have been introduced into us.
An organization called DAESH has emerged in our region. I ask you, whose blood has this organization shed, whose cruelty has it made you groan, whose cities has it destroyed? This organization only shed the blood of Muslims, this organization only persecuted Muslims, this organization only attacked the heritage of the Islamic geography. Supposedly, forces from all over the world have invaded our geography to fight this organization.
Other organizations, from al-Qaeda to Boko Haram, from the PKK to FETÃ, serve the same purpose. These are project terrorist organizations. The picture that has emerged has shown us that the sole purpose of such organizations is to prepare our region for occupation by disrupting the unity and vitality of Muslims, destroying their institutional structures. If the privacy of Jerusalem can be violated so easily today, if the lives and blood of our Palestinian brothers and sisters can be so disregarded, this is one of the reasons behind it.
It is not easy to be in the circle of Islam, to be a Muslim, my brothers, but we have made it very, very easy. And there is a very, very important issue that we need to focus on. Anyone who says 'I am a Muslim' should understand the following advice of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): ""When any one of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand, if he is not able to do so, let him change it with his tongue, and if he is not able to do so, let him change it with his heart, and this is the weakest level of faith.""
Today, as Muslims, we are unfortunately unable to reach a consensus on opposing evil, let alone changing it with our hands, often even with our tongues. And in relation to this, hearts are in the hands of God. The issue of this heedlessness of Muslims is the issue of Jerusalem. If we leave aside our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are defending their land against Israeli aggression, which Muslim has the consciousness to correct the evil in the Jerusalem issue? Confining such an issue, in which most Muslims even speak lal, to their hearts, God forbid, leaves us face to face with that warning of weak faith.
My dear brothers and sisters, one of our poets expresses this subject very well:
""Live Mount TÃ»r so that you may know where Jerusalem is.
I carry Jerusalem like a wristwatch,
Thou shalt spend thy time in vain in Jerusalem without arrangement,
It freezes, your eyes become blind,
Come, be a mother, for a mother makes a Jerusalem out of a child.
When a man becomes a father, a Jerusalem comes alive in him,
Walk, brother, and let a Jerusalem force come to your feet.""
Come, let us march together against this oppression with the power of Jerusalem at our feet, let us not stop, but let us continue this march continuously. And let someone see this march, because despair does not suit a Muslim. There is the good news of my Lord, ""Do not be lax, do not be sad, if you believe, you are surely the superior one."" In order to be worthy of this divine good news, we say to all Muslims, let us unite and confront the oppressors as one wrist and one heart. The day we overcome the heedlessness within ourselves will be the day we strike fear into the heart of the oppressor. God willing, Jerusalem will be the means of salvation for all Muslims. I believe that we will dispose of the dead soil on us by protecting the cause of Jerusalem.
We will not leave this holy city, where the Prophet (S.A.W.) ascended to the miraja, and the legacy of Hazrat Umar (RA) and Saladin Ayyubi unattended. Our Palestinian brothers and sisters have fulfilled their duties and duties so far, and from now on, yes, it is our turn to take over the guard of Jerusalem as 1 billion 750 million Muslims. Are we ready to take the watch? On this occasion, we once again declare that we will never accept the occupation of Jerusalem, the violation of the privacy of Masjid al-Aqsa, and the usurpation of the rights of the Palestinians.
With its decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the United States has once again shown beyond any question that it is a party in the region, not a mediator. America has shown that it is not in favor of solving problems, but in favor of creating problems. The United States is currently the only country blocking the Security Council, the executive body of the United Nations. The resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly have not been recognized by Israel since 1947. Of course, a new United Nations General Assembly resolution on Jerusalem is very important in terms of showing who stands on which side. We are preparing for this right now. As the Chairman-in-Office of the Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we have called an extraordinary meeting of the member states. We'll move on to the meeting from here a little later.
The latest massacre is clear enough to show that the situation in the region can no longer be passed over with decisions that remain on paper. If Israel's state terror is not stopped, the world will rapidly move towards a point where no one can feel safe. For this reason, it is time for the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, other international institutions, and all individual states to take a de facto stance against Israeli oppression.
From here, in Istanbul's YenikapÄ± Square, I especially call on all Muslims and all humanity to take action against those who are dragging our region and the world into disaster with the decisions and massacres that are the result of their own religious fanaticism. A global order that does not side with the oppressed is doomed to become the plaything of the oppressors. I believe that no country, no international organization will put itself in the position of Israel's plaything.
We will fight together with Muslims, Christians, and especially Jews with common sense against the fanatical Zionists' intention to destroy Jerusalem, which is home to the holy places of all religions. We also call on the people of Israel to take action against the catastrophe into which their government has led them. I hope that a people who are victims of the Holocaust will not consent to the crimes against humanity committed by their own state against another people. And I don't think the American public is adequately informed about the meaning of these practices. It is inevitable that the steps taken by the administration regarding the terrorist state of Israel, as well as on terrorist organizations, will one day come back and hit America. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the American people to speak out about the administration's wrongdoings.
Of course, the main issue we need to focus on is what we will do. Turkey is a country that has always shown its stance on Jerusalem and the Palestinian issue both by operating diplomatic channels and by taking concrete steps. Following the latest developments, we have made our stance clear. The fact that Turkey is the country most targeted by Israel and that I am the leader it targets the most shows the correctness and effectiveness of this attitude. Of course, if the person there is targeting me, I'm on the right track. But we believe in one thing; We know that ""La galibe illallah. / Only Allah is the victor."" Whether you have nuclear weapons in your hands as much as you want, or as many weapons as you want, which no one else has, the main thing is the weapon of my Lord. ""And mekeru and mekerallah wa allahu hayrul makirin. / No matter what traps they set, the greatest trap is God's trap."" We are walking this path with this.
Brothers;
We are a nation that does not refrain from fighting for the values we hold sacred, like our ancestors, at the cost of our lives when necessary. From July 15 until the Syrian operations, we have exhibited examples of this struggle in practice? The issue of Jerusalem is an equally important event for us. We are honored to lead Muslims in this struggle. Our struggle will continue until Israel reverses its missteps and demands accountability for its innocent bloodshed. Once again, we express our support for our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are resisting Israeli oppression. We call on all Muslims in the world to shake off, to revive and to rise again. And we call on humanity to take action against these attacks, injustices and spoils, which pose a great threat to everyone.
On this occasion, we immediately invited the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to Istanbul, and from here we will move on to the summit meeting. Tonight, with a short, summary final declaration, I hope the Organization of Islamic Cooperation will take a decision. On this occasion, we invite everyone to participate in the aid campaign for Palestine, which will be launched in all member countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. God willing, the days are near when Jerusalem will achieve peace, our Palestinian brothers will achieve freedom, and the Palestinian lands will gain independence.
To you and all our brothers and sisters who follow us through the media; I express my gratitude for your support, love, enthusiasm and loyalty to the covenant. I congratulate your blessed Ramadan, the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness, and the end of which is salvation from the torment of Hell. I hope that these blessed days will be conducive to peace, well-being and security for our brothers and sisters all over the world, from Syria to Yemen, from Arakan to Africa, especially in Jerusalem.
I would like to thank all our guests, especially Mr. BahÃ§eli, Destici, the Speaker of the Parliament, the Prime Minister and our brothers and sisters who are members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. May God help us. And our Rabia; One nation, one flag, one homeland, one state.
May God make our unity permanent. May our day, our days be blessed. I hope you stay healthy.
"
Speech at the Extraordinary Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,2018-05-18,"

Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
Dear Secretary General,
Dear guests, dear brothers and sisters;
Assalamu alaikum wa mercy and blessings of Allah. I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings in such an extraordinary period. In the same way, I salute all the friends of Jerusalem in the four corners of the world whose hearts beat with us today. Welcome to Istanbul, the confidant, comrade, fateful companion of Jerusalem.
At the beginning of my words, I congratulate your blessed Ramadan, the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness, and the end of which is salvation from the torment of hell, and I pray that this blessed month will be auspicious for the entire Islamic world.
As you know, the month of Ramadan is an exceptional period for us, in which resentments are forgotten, differences are put aside, the bonds of brotherhood are strengthened, and the climate of unity, solidarity and solidarity is felt in the widest way. In accordance with the spirit of Ramadan, I would like to especially thank you, our guests, who came to Istanbul from all over the world to show solidarity, for your brotherhood and sensitivity. Seeing you, the esteemed representatives of the Islamic geography, among us gives strength and courage to all lovers of Jerusalem, especially our Palestinian brothers.
Today, we have gathered in Istanbul because of the brutal attack on the historical and legal status of Jerusalem, our first qibla and the apple of our eye. I pray to Allah that this historic meeting and the decisions we will take will be beneficial for Jerusalem and all of Palestine. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to thank each and every one of you for accepting the invitation we made 3 days ago in a very short time.
To take action for the Palestinians who are being slaughtered today by Israeli thugs is to show the world that humanity is still not dead. To protect Jerusalem today is to protect peace and humanity. Because Jerusalem is the honor, dignity and harem of all Muslims. Jerusalem is the common memory, common heritage and common labor of Muslims. Jerusalem is also the holy city of the three Abrahamic religions. Every attack on Jerusalem is also an attack on all of these values and sensitivities.
With our meeting here today, we are not only demonstrating our reaction against the attempted occupation of Jerusalem, but also protecting the ideal of peaceful coexistence of the 3 heavenly religions. Today, we say stop to those who want to drown our region in blood and tears. With our meeting here, we shout that our Palestinian brothers and sisters are never alone in their struggle.
Once again, I want everyone to know that the cause of Jerusalem is the cause of all Muslims. Jerusalem is too holy a holy city to be left at the mercy of a terrorist state with the blood of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians on its hands. Muslims will not take a single step back from their rights to East Jerusalem. Just as Monday, May 14 was a black day in the history of humanity, Friday, May 18 will hopefully be written as a day when human dignity was saved with our joint efforts.
I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of my brothers and sisters in this hall for protecting the dignity, honor and historical status of Jerusalem. I believe that this attitude of yours is very valuable not only for our religious brothers and sisters, but also for Christians, Jews and people of other faiths. I'm putting the Zionists aside here, aren't they behind all this? They exist. Hopefully, we will strengthen this stance in the decisions we will take today.
Dear brothers and sisters;
As you know, from the moment the first signs of the illegal decision of the United States of America began to appear, we warned the United States administration that such a step would increase tensions in the region, cause new tensions and new conflicts. We stated that even moving a stone in the Holy Land would cause serious problems. We have repeatedly stated that such unilateral steps that violate international law and undermine the United Nations will harm not only Muslims and Christians, but also Jews. We have specifically stated that if the wrong is insisted on, the entire region will enter a climate of conflict, and those who implement the decision will be responsible for this.
Unfortunately, our well-intentioned warnings did not find a response from our interlocutors, who were experiencing a great eclipse of reason. Despite all the warnings, the United States has become a prisoner of tensions and conflict-fueled circles. Ignoring the will of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. administration chose to ride on the coattails of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and some radical evangelicals. On Monday, May 14, the United States moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which is also the capital of Palestine, despite the growing reactions from the world.
On the same day, a massacre was carried out against our Palestinian brothers and sisters who were protesting the decision. Israel brutally martyred 62 of our Palestinian brothers and sisters, including children and women, who were exercising their democratic rights and resisting the occupation with their bare hands. As a result of the Israeli attacks, 2700 Palestinians were injured, some seriously. Once again, I wish the mercy of Almighty Allah on all our martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection and defense of Jerusalem, our first qibla, and a speedy recovery to our injured brothers.
I say it loud and clear, what Israel is doing is banditry, brutality and state terrorism. There is no difference between the persecution of Jews in Europe 75 years ago and the brutality that our brothers and sisters in Gaza are subjected to today. Unfortunately, the children of people who were subjected to all kinds of torture in concentration camps during the Second World War are now attacking innocent Palestinians with methods that almost stoned the Nazis. How else can the slaughter of people in wheelchairs without two legs be explained? How else to describe shooting an 8-month-old baby in its mother's arms? Can there be a single valid excuse for the brutal murder of women, children and innocent demonstrators? How else can one explain the drowning in blood and tears of the moving Palestinians, whom Mahmoud Darwish called ""my country flowing with milk and honey""?
Israel not only commits these murders in front of the whole world, but also tries to justify itself by accusing the people whose blood it sheds. The Israeli government thinks it can cover up its massacres with lies. Because every murder that is not held accountable before the law makes the perpetrator even more angry. Israel is becoming more reckless and day by day because it has not accounted before the law for its policies of violence against Palestinians for years. Taking advantage of the embarrassment of some Western countries, it adds a new one to its massacres every day. The deportations, massacres and oppressions that started with the Nakba on May 15, 1948 have been continuing exponentially for 70 years. Monday, May 14, has been recorded as a new Nakba day in the history of Palestine.
Dear brothers and sisters,
At the point reached today, the United States of America has rewarded Israel, which has stoned the apartheid regime with its occupation policies, and punished Palestine, which has repeatedly proven that it wants peace. The blood of innocent Palestinians is smeared on the hands of the United States of America, which paved the way for Israel's massacres with the Jerusalem decision. The United States is no longer part of the solution in the Middle East, but part of the problem. It is imperative that new actors are involved in the process and that the peace process regains its functioning on a solid basis.
In this regard, as the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, we have started to take steps in coordination with our Palestinian brothers. We must work together with our Palestinian brothers and sisters to ensure that Israel's atrocities and massacres do not go unpunished. Israel must answer for the innocents it has slaughtered before the international judiciary. We will follow up on this issue before the United Nations General Assembly. Unfortunately, every step taken to ensure justice is vetoed by the American administration in the Security Council. We will take the issue to the United Nations General Assembly again, and I hope we will get the support of all Islamic countries and people of conscience. During the month of Ramadan, we will organize aid campaigns for our Palestinian brothers and sisters in all Islamic countries, especially in our own country. In addition, we will show our reaction using diplomatic channels.
At this point, we all know this fact very well: Condemning, getting angry and shouting has not stopped the occupation and oppression until today, and it will not stop it in the future. No one will offer us our rights on a golden platter until Muslims get their rights. Although Muslims have been right in Bosnia, Syria, Rakhine and many other places, the winners have always been the tyrants in power. It is time to change this corrupt and unjust order.
The U.S. decision on Jerusalem is a harbinger of new operations against the Islamic world. If we don't react adequately on this issue, believe me, much worse will come. Our success in this matter will be a turning point for Muslims. For this, we will first gather ourselves, then we will gather, we will stick together. And my Lord's command is clear, ""All of you hold fast to the rope of Allah, do not fall into division, do not be divided and torn apart"", we will obey this divine command.
As Islamic countries, we will never give up our demand for a sovereign and independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. I believe that the messages we give here today will be seriously evaluated by the whole world. I would like to thank you once again for your participation.
Hopefully, the final declaration that we will announce will have a very different effect on the entire Islamic world, all over the world. May Allah help us, Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah and blessings of Allah (swt).

Their Speech at the Iftar Program with the Families of the Martyrs,2018-05-16,
Speech at Chatham House in London,2018-05-14,
Their Speech at the Turkish-British TatlÄ±dil Forum,2018-05-13,"

Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and affection. The 7th edition of the Turkish-British TatlÄ±dil Forum. I would especially like to express my pleasure to be with you on the occasion of the meeting.
As it is known, there will soon be general elections for the presidency and parliament in Turkey. In this election, we are moving to the presidential system of government in accordance with the decision taken by our nation in the referendum adopted last year. I am also a candidate for the presidency. Despite the election process, I especially wanted to attend this meeting, which was planned in advance, as per my promise. A little while ago, my delegation and I got off the plane, and I have come before you to address you with the dust of my feet.
The Turkish-British TatlÄ±dil Forum has a special place in my heart. As you know, the foundations of our current strategic partnership with the United Kingdom and the TatlÄ±dil Forum were laid during my Prime Ministership. We established this platform, which made a significant contribution to our bilateral relations, together with the Prime Minister of the time, David Cameron, during my visit to London in 2011. TatlÄ±dil Forum has become stronger and institutionalized every year, and here it is today.
This is a maturity created by politicians, businessmen, academics and media members, and a channel that I can almost call a 'think tank'. In other words, it is possible to consider this as a 'timetable'. Not only did I support the strengthening and development of the forum, but I also attended these meetings whenever I had the opportunity. Last year, we hosted a well-attended event in Antalya, one of the most distinguished cities of our country. This year, we held our meeting in an atmosphere that bears traces of the historical roots of our relations.
I would like to congratulate the co-chairs Jack Straw, Sir Julian Horn-Smith, Mr. Reha DenemeÃ§ and Mr. BÃ¼lent GÃ¶ktuna, who contributed to the organization of the forum. I would also like to thank Prince Andrew, Duke of York, for his valuable support to the Turkish-British TatlÄ±dil Forum since its inception.
Distinguished guests;
The relations between our countries have a deep-rooted historical past of nearly 500 years. During this time, there have been numerous periods in which our countries have become closer to each other. Among them, there are historical events such as Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and the Crimean War. One of the most important documents of these deep historical relations is the Ottoman Order, which is exhibited at the entrance of this hall where the TatlÄ±dil Forum was held. Admiral Lord Nelson, the national hero of England, was the recipient of the first order given by the Ottoman Emperor to a non-Muslim. Sultan Selim III presented him with this order for his efforts during the invasion of Egypt in 1798. Admiral Nelson proudly wore this insignia, called a wreath, from the Battle of Trafalgar to the moment he breathed his last. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Golfsmith for bringing the replica of this work to the public.
Turkey-UK relations, which have such a deep-rooted historical background, are going through a period in which our cooperation is further developing, deepening and gaining momentum in every field. The high level of our relations today is also important due to the recent referendums held in both countries.
Turkey has decided to change its system of government with the constitutional amendment last year. With this change, we are creating a more effective and efficient management model that will carry Turkey to its 2023 targets. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is taking steps to implement the 'Brexit' decision taken in the referendum in 2016. To this end, it continues to negotiate with the European Union and is working on reforms that will prepare it for the post-Brexit period.
Another important issue that brings our relations closer is; It is the sincere solidarity shown by the United Kingdom with our country after the July 15 coup attempt by FETÃ. I would especially like to thank Alan for this; It is worthy of gratitude that he called us immediately and came immediately. We will never forget the solidarity shown with our country in the aftermath of this despicable coup attempt that directly targeted Turkish democracy, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the elected government and myself.
While many Western countries were unable to even condemn this treacherous attack, the British authorities immediately made the necessary statements of support and took a stand in favor of democracy. Thus, after July 15, the United Kingdom showed that it is a true friend as well as our alliance and strategic partnership.
Dear participants;
The increasing overlap of our commercial and economic interests and the expansion of cooperation areas are another issue that brings our relations closer. In fact, when we look at it historically, trade has always been the locomotive of our bilateral relations. The ambassadors appointed by the British Empire to the Ottoman Empire since 1583 have been the representatives of the Levant Company for a long time. Yusuf AgÃ¢h Efendi, one of the first ambassadors sent abroad by the Ottomans, came to London in 1793. In 1851, when the world's first international exhibition was held in today's Hyde Park, we see that the Ottoman Empire took part in the exhibition with an important contribution. In fact, one of the most visited areas of the exhibition was the section of the Ottoman Empire.
Today, we have a brilliant report card in the field of trade and economy. The UK is the second largest export market for us in Europe. Our total trade volume is over 16 billion dollars. When Prime Minister May visited our country last year, we set a goal for ourselves, we said; We need to find $20 billion immediately. We are currently working together for this.
We are determined to maintain the momentum we have achieved in our economic and commercial relations and to adapt to changing conditions. Our experts meet regularly and consider all options, including the signing of a free trade agreement between the two countries.
I would like to address the esteemed members of the British business world who are here today: We are home to more than 3 thousand British companies in our country. We do not discriminate in the slightest between our own companies and UK companies. In this way, you have made an investment of approximately 10 billion dollars in our country in just 15 years. We consider this situation as a manifestation of your confidence in our country. We will continue to host you in the best way possible.
Turkey has a domestic market of 81 million people. With our young, dynamic, trained workforce, strong infrastructure and experienced private sector, we strive to make this market more attractive for you. The location of our country allows you to reach a huge market with a population of 1.5 billion with a 3-4 hour flight. Recently, we have put into effect ambitious and comprehensive incentive programs. We are also continuing our preparations to announce new ones. In this context, I am waiting for you to our country for more investments.
Dear friends;
On this occasion, I would like to mention one issue in particular. In the coming period, let's not be satisfied with our companies mutually operating in Turkey or the United Kingdom and buying and selling goods and services. Let's explore the possibilities of producing high value-added and high-tech products together. Our partnership in the field of defense industry is the best example of what we can achieve together. Within the framework of our National Combat Aircraft project, we have now raised the bar very high with our goal of producing fifth-generation fighter jets. In addition, let's market the products we design and manufacture jointly to third countries together. Let's take advantage of business and trade opportunities in different geographies of the world together. The synergy that will emerge when Turkey's operational capabilities and the UK's financial power come together will provide great gains for both sides. Let's take advantage of this opportunity together.
Last year, an important step was taken in this regard through Eximbank and the UK's export-finance agency UKEF. A comprehensive cooperation has been established, which allows Turkish and British companies to co-finance projects in third countries. I think that this cooperation will make it easier for our companies to establish partnerships in third countries.
Tourism used to be an important area of cooperation, but there had been a recession for some time. This year, it has become active. Among the 40 million tourists we aim to host, we especially wish to see you. Such contacts, beyond these, of course, we also want you to have a house. There are already many of our British friends who own a house, but it is not enough, we want to increase this number even more. Beyond economic activity, this will also strengthen our friendship.
Dear guests;
I consider the strategic partnership between Turkey and the United Kingdom as a necessity for the interests of both countries and a wide geography at the same time, beyond being a simple choice. As Turkey, we attach importance to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region. We are working for the establishment of lasting peace and security in the Middle East. We aim to stabilize countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. We want a joint fight against all forms of terrorism. All these issues have an important place in the priority agenda of our countries.
There are very serious challenges that affect the whole world right next to our country. Turkey and the United Kingdom, as two responsible members of the international community and two allies, are fighting shoulder to shoulder in these challenges. We are mutually determined to fight the causes of terrorism and irregular migration at their source. We also have a common will for greater cooperation in delivering humanitarian aid to those in need around the world.
As you know, it is the country that has the most help in the world; America in the first place; two Turkey, three England. But when we do this in relation to national income, when we look at it in relation to national income, number one is Turkey, number two is America, number three is England. This shows one thing: We are open-handed countries and our solidarity should continue to increase. Turkey is waging an extremely effective fight against a large number of terrorist organizations at the same time. With the measures we take in the field of combating terrorism, we ensure the security of Europe and the whole world as well as our own people.
There is another issue that I am sensitive to and would like to mention on this occasion; Calling Daesh an 'Islamic state' is extremely wrong. Because DAESH is a bloody gang that inflicts the greatest damage on Muslims and kills innocent Muslims, it is a terrorist organization. Peace is at the root of the word Islam. Islam comes from the word 'slm', which means 'peace'. Our religion is a religion of peace, a religion of brotherhood. I think that the United Kingdom, with its multicultural, pluralistic nature with many Muslim citizens, can understand us better in this regard than our other allies and friends. I can sincerely say that; Our cooperation with the UK, particularly in the fight against terrorism, goes far ahead of the mechanisms we have established with our other partners.
Dear guests;
On the occasion of my visit to the United Kingdom, we will also have extensive discussions with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister May. In addition, I would like to reiterate the message we will give in these meetings: The United Kingdom is our strategic partner that we value and trust. As Turkey, we are ready to cooperate more with the United Kingdom in all areas in the post-Brexit period. In this direction, we expect support and contribution from you. Let's evaluate Turkey's potential together at the regional and global level.
We are a nation that never forgets our friends who stand by us in difficult times. In these days when we are on the threshold of a new era, the value we will give to our friends who will walk with us will be very different.
I thank you all. I am already waiting for you in Turkey for the next meeting of the Turkish-British TatlÄ±dil Forum. Stay healthy.

150th Session of the Council of State. Their Speech at the Anniversary Dinner,2018-05-12,"

Dear President and members of the Council of State,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen,
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, affection and respect.
I once again congratulate the 150th anniversary of the Council of State and the Day of the Council of State and Administrative Judiciary.
On this occasion, I would like to welcome our guests from abroad to our country and Istanbul.
Dear guests...
This dinner is taking place on the eve of the implementation of a very important step taken by Turkey last year regarding the independence of the legislative, executive and judicial powers.
We clearly state at every opportunity what we aim to achieve with the new management system.
With the new system, we aim for the Parliament to focus on making laws and supervising the government, the government on effective execution, and the judiciary on the delivery of justice in an independent and impartial manner.
The establishment and sustainability of democracy is directly proportional to the trust of the society in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
In a place where the judiciary cannot ensure the delivery of justice, it is not possible for other powers to be the bearers of democracy alone.
Essentially, the yearning for justice is a quest that goes beyond democracy and is on par with human history.
Where there is no justice, all other threats and dangers are open.
For this reason, the concept of justice has a very special place in our faith and culture.
Today, on the faÃ§ade of all our courthouses, behind the lecterns where our judges and prosecutors sit, it is written ""Justice is the Basis of Property"".
Likewise, Hazrat Mevlana's definitions and analogies about the concept of justice are of a nature to give messages to all humanity.
The delicacy of a civilization that defines justice as ""putting something in its place"" and injustice as ""putting something where it is not worthy"" almost forces us to be constantly vigilant about judgment.
Hazrat Rumi sees law as ""a drop from the ocean of divine justice"" and points out that this drop, no matter how small, carries the purity of the ocean.
This approach imposes great responsibilities on members of the judiciary.
The rule of law and the rule of law approach are the gateway to justice.
If this door is closed, it is not possible to determine what is justice and what is cruelty.
It is inevitable that a state administration that is not bound by the law will eventually evolve into arbitrariness.
If the grief of the oppressed rises to heaven in a country, there can be no talk of justice, law, or the future of the state.
That is why, no matter how troublesome, we cannot compromise on the law and the rule of law.
Dear guests...
Personally, I have come across many decisions of the judiciary that I am not satisfied with, from our Constitutional Courts to our Court of Cassation and Council of State, to our courts of first instance.
Of course, I expressed my displeasure, criticisms, objections.
But I never refrained from complying with these decisions.
Because my opinion, my approach, my evaluation only binds me.
In practice, the main thing is what the laws enacted by the legislature and the judiciary, which is obliged to decide accordingly, say.
To put it bluntly, Turkey's rule of law is much stronger and more effective than the western countries, which are supposedly the bastion of this business.
As you know, Turkey was subjected to a despicable coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Behind this coup attempt were not only the soldiers, but also the members of the same gang in the police and judiciary.
Despite this, starting from the first hours of the coup attempt, all transactions were carried out in accordance with the principle of the rule of law.
Our prosecutors opened their investigations, our security forces made the necessary interventions with the instructions they received, and our courts made their decisions according to the documents and information they received.
No one can deny the fact that countries that are exposed to much milder threats than Turkey is experiencing have put the law on the shelf.
Some western countries are also included in this.
Despite all kinds of attacks, Turkey has taken an exemplary stance by not compromising the rule of law.
However, please be sure that the criticism we are subjected to has no rational and genuine basis, and is purely politically motivated.
As a politician who has suffered from unlawful actions and actions in the past, I have never thought of circumventing the law.
Not only that, but I was the first to stand up to those who wanted to take any step in this direction.
Some people are talking about the state of emergency in our country and questioning our rule of law through it.
Turkey has experienced very painful and troublesome state of emergency practices in the past.
However, no one can claim or prove that the state of emergency that we imposed after July 15 was used in any field other than the fight against terrorism.
In fact, I would go much further and say that the current practice is carried out in such a gentle way that perhaps even 1 percent of the emergency powers in our Constitution and laws are not used.
After the elections, with the establishment of our new system of governance, it is highly likely that there will be no need for this practice.
Those who want to see a state of emergency imposed should go and look at the ruthlessness, disproportionate violence and unconscionable restrictions displayed in European countries when the slightest turmoil and confusion arises.
There have never been and will never be such scenes in Turkey.
Dear guests...
On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the establishment of our Council of State, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to realize this beautiful meeting with you.
Once again, I congratulate you on your Administrative Justice Day.
I offer you my love and respect.
Stay healthy...
"
Their Speech at the Collective Opening Ceremony of 250 Restored Works,2018-05-08,"

Dear guests,
Dear representatives of our foundations,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with affection and reverence. On the occasion of this meaningful ceremony, I am very fortunate to host you at the Presidential Complex, in this veteran place. I congratulate you on your Foundation Week, which was organized between 7-12 May with the theme of 'Women who establish foundations', and I wish God to be instrumental in good deeds. I believe that the events to be held on the occasion of this week will hopefully contribute to a better understanding and survival of our strong foundation tradition, especially the foundations established by our women.
The foundations implemented by our women in the fields of education, health, religion and culture are a big life in the lands where Muslims have set foot for centuries. From the Great Mosque of DivriÄi to the Hatuniye Madrasa of Mardin, from the Melike Hatun Mosque in Ankara to the Gevher Nesibe Hospital in Kayseri, from the HÃ¼rrem Imarethane in Jerusalem to the GÃ¼lnuÅ Emetullah Mosque, fountain and hospital in Mecca, Medina and Egypt, thousands of works are still serving humanity in all corners of our geography. On this occasion, I would like to thank all the foundation owners who have made efforts on this path by adopting the principle of 'hayrun nas men yenfeun nas' as their motto, who have established foundations in accordance with the command 'the best of people is the most beneficial to people', who have done charity, and who have left behind works that are beneficial to humanity, and I pray for Allah's mercy on those who have apostatized to the world of survival.
Of course, it is also important to establish foundations, to build works, to keep them alive as much as these, and to deliver them to future generations in the best way possible. The owner of the first foundation has the right to us, the users. Every foundation is also a trust entrusted to us. Protecting the trust is a requirement of our faith and creed. In this respect, it is imperative that we all pay attention to the works of the foundation, protect them and, of course, use them in accordance with the foundation deeds.
However, we see that there has not been a very good test in this regard until recently. Unfortunately, our country has witnessed great negligence and even betrayal in the protection of foundation works for a while. Especially the single-party CHP period has a long record on this issue. During these unfortunate years of Turkey, many foundation works were plundered, usurped and left alone with their fate. This mentality, which is at odds with its history, culture and ancient values of the nation, has also betrayed the trust of our ancestors. Hundreds of mosques defying the ages have been sold, rented out or used as museums, warehouses and stables. Some authors state that the number of mosques closed during this period was much higher than what was recorded.
The main reason underlying this culture of resentment against the heritage of the ancestors, especially the works of the foundation, is ideological bigotry. As a result of this bigotry, our yellow cultural household has been labeled as an 'example of backwardness' for thousands of years during the one-party era. The same circles believed that this heritage, which they could not appreciate, should be 'subjected to a strict liquidation'. Those who see the Arabic call to prayer as a sign of bigotry, and for this reason, have kept it missing from our skies for 18 years, have put mosques up for sale under the pretext of surplus.
Unfortunately, the Ottoman archives, which were sold to Bulgaria for 3 cents each, also got their share from this sales frenzy. The so-called scrap papers, most of which consist of valuable archival documents, constitute the rarest and most reliable works of the Sofia Library today. This is the CHP mentality; There is no such history, no history, no art, no culture, no such thing as preserving them. Those papers, which were scrapped in the name of a self-proclaimed modernity, are now the crown jewel as documents that shed light on Ottoman history.
We also come across ancestral heirlooms plundered from our country in many countries of Europe. Believe me, our hearts break when we see how the works of our ancestors, which are entrusted to us, are destroyed. Our sadness increases even more as we witness the care they show to the works of 50-100 years of countries whose history is too short to be compared with our country. Our travels abroad show us, among other things, the extent of the damage that the one-party mentality has done to our country. We better understand the damage caused to our national structure by this understanding, which aims to take revenge on history and transform the nation by force and oppression. On the occasion of these trips, we see better how much of a wreck the one-party dictatorship has left in culture, education, politics, social and human fields.
Brothers;
In this period when the world is increasingly exposed to a cultural barrenness, only societies that have a civilization accumulation from the past and a civilization vision for the future can preserve their originality. Those who fail to do so will be lost among billions of people. We are a nation that has both an ancient civilization accumulation and has not lost our strong civilization vision. Of course, we are aware of the severe damage caused by the media, communication, the internet and popular culture, but we are hopeful. Because the treasure we have is so big and so voluminous that, as I have just stated, it still has the power to keep us alive despite all the looting and all the destruction.
The solution for the defense and revival of our civilization is not to fight technology, but to use the possibilities of technology. From our archives to our libraries, from our museums to our local values, we record all the material assets of our civilization with the help of technology and present them to everyone. Academic and popular studies of our history and culture are increasing. From television series to movies, from novels to computer games, we see that there is a race in this regard. We are witnessing that the influence of our traditional arts is increasingly felt in many areas from architecture to clothing.
Despite this, we still have a very important shortcoming, which is the difficulty we have experienced in creating the curriculum of our education system in a way that gives awareness of civilization, history and culture. While other societies, other states, produce legends from their non-existent histories and gather their children around them, we cannot use our existing treasures. Hopefully, one of our biggest goals in the new period is to establish our education system that will instill such a consciousness in our children, both with its content and physical infrastructure. In this direction, there are many steps we need to take in every aspect from the furnishing of our schools to the quality of our teachers.
In the same way, we have to quickly overcome our sterility in transforming our culture and art policies into the locomotive of our civilization vision. A culture and art climate that is hostile to its own country, its own society, its own history, its own civilization, let alone supporting and pioneering, will take us to surrender to global popular culture. Local and national understanding should be our ideal in culture and art as well as in every subject.
We see that all the important cultural and artistic works of the world have local and national inspirations. The architecture of Renaissance Europe, which influenced the world, is an example of this. We know that the works of the late Cengiz Aitmatov, each of which has become a world classic, flourished in Kyrgyz culture. Aren't Dostoevsky and Tolstoy's Russian, Shakespeare's British, and Victor Hugo's French culture themes all world classics? So we can create universal products that sprout from our own culture. As long as we can get rid of those complexes that they have been trying to drown us in for years and be ourselves. Believe me, the rest is very easy. We have worked for this for 16 years. We have succeeded, we have failed, but we have never given up the struggle, we will never give up.
Dear brothers and sisters;
As in many other aspects, 2002 is a turning point in the revival of our foundation tradition and the protection of the heritage of our ancestors. Since this date, we have been striving to protect the works of the foundation both at home and abroad. In the 10-year period before 2002, only 46 cultural assets were restored or repaired, while in the last 16 years, we have restored and repaired 5060 cultural assets. This figure corresponds to a 110-fold increase compared to the previous period.
Thanks to meticulous work, we have brought to light more than 10 million documents that have remained behind closed doors for years. Today, the archive of our Turkish Armed Forces has been fully opened and is now ready for examination. The Presidential Archive has been opened in the same way, it is ready for examination. If anyone has the heart, let them come. I have repeatedly made this call, especially to those who claim the so-called Armenian genocide; If you have the heart, please go ahead, we are opening our archives, if you have any, open your archives too. But they are only doing nothing but smear Turkey and continue campaigns against Turkey with their diasporas around the world. There is plenty of money, they are spending money, and with this they want to turn Turkey into a so-called criminal situation. You won't be able to bring it, because we're right. Millions of artifacts that were condemned to dusty shelves in cellars for a long time are now offered to the benefit of our people in modern foundation museums, the number of which we have increased from 4 to 11.
Not only in the country, but also in different corners of our heartland, we find, restore and restore many ancestral heirlooms. So far, we have completed the inventory of the foundation's cultural assets in three countries, namely Crimea, Hungary and Yemen. In Sarajevo, we restored and put into service the ruined Isa Bey Bath and Gradishka DerviÅ HanÄ±m Madrasa. The restoration and reconstruction works of the Alaca Mosque in FoÃ§a and the Sinanbey Mosque in ÃayniÃ§e, which were destroyed during the war years, are still continuing. Likewise, the restoration of the Bascarsija Mosque and Travnik Alaca Mosque in Sarajevo and the Arnavudiye Mosque in Banja Luka continues. We also revived the Haydar Kadi Mosque, which has been closed for 100 years and completely in ruins in the city of Bitola in Macedonia.
The restoration of the Ohrid Ali Pasha Mosque, the Skopje Isa Bey Mosque and its outbuildings, the Yahya Pasha Mosque and the Monastery HacÄ± Mahmut Bey Mosque are also ongoing. The HadÄ±m SÃ¼leyman AÄa Library in Cakova, Kosovo has completed the reconstruction in the same way and has become ready for service. The project works of the Muezzin Hodja Mosque in Mitrovica, the Alaaddin Bey, Pirinaz, and BuzaÄÄ± Mosques in Pristina, as well as the Gazi Ali Bey Mosque in VÄ±Ã§Ä±tÄ±rÄ±n continue. While the restoration of the DÃ¼kkan ÃnÃ¼ Mosque in Nicosia continues, the projects of the Selimiye Mosque and Famagusta Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosques are currently being prepared.
The project work of the Isa Bey Bath in Novi Pazar, Serbia continues. We have prepared the cooperation protocol of the Albanian Shkodra KurÅunlu Mosque, and after the approval of our interlocutors, we are immediately going out to tender. We witness similar scenes of pride in many areas, from the discovery of the graves of our martyrs to the return of artifacts smuggled abroad to our country. On top of all that, we are currently building a magnificent mosque in Tirana, the capital of Albania.
Dear friends;
I consider this meaningful ceremony we held at the Presidential Complex as the best sign of the sensitivity we show in protecting the trust. On behalf of myself and my nation, I would like to congratulate our General Directorate of Foundations, which has restored 250 foundation works in 7 regions of our country in accordance with their essence, spirit and intended use.
Among the 250 restored works are mosques, masjids, libraries, dormitories, mansions, tombs, lodges, inns, baths, caravanserais, as well as churches and synagogues. Among these 250 restorations are the Nusaybin Zeynel Abidin Mosque and the Diyarbakir Sur Armenian Protestant Church, which were badly damaged in the attacks of the separatist organization. The ownership of places of worship in different cities of our country without any discrimination or marginalization is very important in terms of showing our perspective on members of other faiths.
O bright and dark faces of France, you demand and propose that some verses from the Qur'an be removed. Look, in our civilization, in our understanding, there is no approach, no understanding that says extract this and that from the Bible, the Psalms, the Torah. On the contrary, we find all the heavenly books respectable, and we do not speculate on them. And is it your place to use these expressions about our holy book, the Holy Quran? Lately, you have already dissipated it thoroughly; If it's attacking our mosques, you're attacking our mosques, and if it's arson, you're committing arson. But in our country, attacking a church and allowing the attacker; What did we do, what did we get done, that's the difference between us. You are no different from Daesh, at all.
This attitude is actually the best answer to bloody terrorist organizations such as DAESH, FETÃ and Boko Haram, which use our beloved religion for their own perverted ideologies, use it abundantly. In our faith, places of worship are inviolable, especially our holy books. Anyone who violates it, regardless of the motive, is also violating the precepts of Islam and is un-Islamic. On the other hand, our attitude should also serve as a lesson to some Islamophobic European politicians, especially Sarkozy, who, in the name of defending Western values, protect those who attack Islam and pat themselves on the back for those who set fire to mosques.
The understanding of the fascists, who try to blame the massacres of a few criminals on Muslims, and the inhumane ideologies of Daesh terrorists are like two sides of the same coin. These two groups, which are ostensibly enemies, actually serve the same purpose. Our civilization has long been far from these two morbid understandings. Just as we are against those who set fire to mosques in the heart of Europe, we are also against those who attack churches in Syria and Iraq. Just as we defend the freedom of worship of our citizens, we also defend the freedom of worship of members of all other faiths.
The ancestors say, 'The educated ignorant is more harmful than the black ignorant'. We see the recent statements made by three or five ignorant people in France as mere reflections of their ignorance. This mob knows neither our Bible, nor their own history, nor the Bible and Torah they claim to believe in. We do not and will not take into account the delusions of this mob that has lost its cohesion and has become moldy academically, politically and intellectually. As members of a civilization that has taken care of the oppressed regardless of religion, language or belief, we will continue to defend the right, justice and the ideal of living together in peace, as we have done so far.
We will neither leave the square to the heretics of DAESH and FETÃ, nor will we bow to the propaganda of Islamophobic circles. Along with our mosques, we will honor the places of worship of members of other religions, and we will try to protect them to the end. Today, we will show our Western friends, who are afraid of minarets and condemn Muslims to small masjids instead of allowing mosques, how freedom of worship and belief should be, as we are here today. I pray that God will help us.
As I conclude my words with these thoughts, I once again wish that the restored works will be beneficial to all Muslims. I would like to express my gratitude to our Government, which has brought these works to our country and nation in accordance with the original. Stay healthy.

Dear Roma brothers and sisters,
Dear guests,
Ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings, longing and affection. Today, I am very pleased to meet with you, our esteemed Roma brothers and sisters, here at the Presidential Complex, in the home of the nation. Someone imitates it, we do the original. We live, someone makes political investments. Through you, I especially send my love and greetings to all our Roma brothers and sisters in Turkey and around the world.
Our affection with our Roma brothers and sisters goes back to ancient times, to our childhood years. We grew up in houses side by side with our Roma brothers and sisters in KasÄ±mpaÅa, we played together on the street, we made paper balls, we played with those balls we made out of paper. We rolled and rolled in the streets, we went to the same school, we worshipped shoulder to shoulder in the same mosque, we lived every moment of our lives together. There were no Turks, Roma, Kurds, Laz, Bosniaks or Georgians for us, and we all loved each other for Allah's sake, we saw each other as a servant of Allah. What does he say in his beautiful song; ""Whether he is a Roman, / Whether he is made of stone or mud, / He is a servant of God / Whoever he is."" Yes, since we were all servants of Allah, we looked at each other and treated each other in the same way.
Has there never been discrimination in our country, and is it not happening now? Of course there was, and it still happens today, albeit to a lesser extent. Such negative thoughts, attitudes and behaviors can be seen not only against Roma, but also against all segments of society. In addition to being a noble creature, man is also a being that has a tendency to deviate from wrong paths at the individual and social level.
We just listened to the violin, didn't we? It's a novel, but what kind of violin, it makes you talk, it makes you cry. Look, he is a brother of ours who is famous in this world right now. The question is, what comes out of his soul? The question is, how does that spirit reflect on the outside? And to value it is that 'the work is valuable for its author,' says the poet. Where are you going to look here too? You will look at the owner of that work. Now, as I entered, I saw some of our artists inside. But, of course, they probably don't exist here. We just listened to the hymn of our brother Kibariye, mashallah.
Brothers;
See what the Prophet (S.A.W.) says in his Farewell Sermon: ""People, your Lord is one, your father is also one, you are all the children of Adam. Adam, on the other hand, is of the earth. Just as there is no superiority of the Arab over the non-Arab, and the non-Arab over the Arab, there is no superiority of the red-skinned over the black, and the black over the red-skinned. Supremacy is only through piety. The most precious of you in the sight of God is the one who fears him the most."" As you can see, the Prophet (S.A.W.) clearly shows us the measure of how we should take care of people. No one has superiority over anyone else because of their race, skin or any other human characteristic. Superiority is only in piety. It is the fear of God.
Throughout our lives, we have always acted with the understanding that ""we love the created because of the Creator"". From the Mayor of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality to the Prime Minister and now to the Presidency, I have been intertwined with my Roma brothers and sisters, and I have never lost contact. We were born in the same neighborhood, we grew up in the same neighborhood, so look, the President can come out of there, the Prime Minister can come out of there. On the occasion of such meetings, during our visits to the provinces, and on my visits to KasÄ±mpaÅa, I embraced my Roma brothers and sisters. Hopefully, we will continue on our way in the same way until the end of our lives. We will not remain French to our Roma brothers and sisters like France.
Brothers;
Of course, we did not leave our love and affection for our Roma brothers and sisters only with words. We have eliminated the practices reflected in the legislation against our Roma brothers and sisters, whom I see as a very important color of our country. As mentioned earlier, in 2006 we amended the Housing Law and eliminated discriminatory expressions. In the same year, we ensured that the discriminatory expressions in the Police Directive were removed. At the end of 2009, under the chairmanship of our Deputy Prime Minister, we convened a Roma Workshop with the participation of federations and associations from 36 provinces of Turkey. Thus, for the first time in the history of the Republic, our Roma citizens had the opportunity to talk and discuss their issues at the highest level of the state.
We started a project in cooperation with TOKI and the Ministry of Family and Social Policies to solve the housing problems of our Roma citizens. We have built a total of 4608 social housing units in 31 centers in different parts of our country. Unfortunately, we could not continue this housing project, which our Roma citizens paid in monthly installments of 130 liras. Because the social housing built consists of multi-storey buildings in accordance with the general concept of TOKI. However, our Roma citizens have the culture of living in detached houses. Due to the high cost of land in the cities, the construction of houses was suspended because our Ministry could not finance this project. If our Roma citizens help us to solve the land issue through the cooperatives they will establish among themselves, I hope we will continue to help them in the construction of housing.
Dear brothers and sisters;
Mosques in the areas where our Roma citizens live are actively operating through our specially appointed imams. With the amendment made to the Turkish Penal Code in 2014, hate and discrimination crimes were redefined. Accordingly, the punishment for those who commit acts due to hatred arising from a person's language, race, nationality, color, gender, disability, political opinion, philosophical belief, religion and sect has been increased.
Now what does that mean? I say something to the Roma federations and the President of the Confederation; What is this? I think it would be useful to improve the language study and follow my Deputy Prime Minister Hakan Bey on this issue. As a party, I say that it is beneficial for Ms. Ãznur to follow this work. What will this language do for you to integrate among yourselves, it will increase and develop even more.
One of the duties of institutions such as the Human Rights and Equality Institution of Turkey and the Ombudsman Institution, which we have put into operation, is to prevent discrimination against our citizens. The issues included in the strategy document and action plan for Roma citizens prepared in 2016 under the coordination of our Ministry of Family and Social Policies are being implemented step by step. In this context, projects are being developed to increase the level of education and gain vocational skills in order to support the employment of our Roma citizens. As a matter of fact, in the last 3 years alone, 5608 Roma citizens have been able to benefit from vocational training, courses and programs in order to enable them to participate in employment.
With another project carried out under the name of SIROMA, studies were carried out for the education, health, workforce and social solidarity efforts of our Roma citizens in 12 provinces. The list goes on and on. I would like to take this opportunity to invite our relevant institutions to act a little faster on the issues included in the strategy document and action plan, and to focus on execution-oriented studies.
Although some people remember the Roma only on Roma Day and try to use them as a tool of abuse, you know very well what we are doing and what we are going to do. Mr. Kemal says, 'I have come to your feet, the President is calling you to his feet.' Mr. Kemal, I was born among my Roma brothers and sisters, I came out of there, I came from there. Moreover, the issue is not only the Roma issue, the issue is the issue of Turkey's total development, growth and enrichment. When that happens, all 81 million of our citizens will benefit. This is how we have developed Turkey in democracy and economy, and we continue to do so.
Brothers;
In the past, especially around our metropolitan cities, there were settlements built of makeshift buildings that had no infrastructure, no social opportunities, no economic attraction. In that Kotra that we just watched on the screen, I actually went to 6-7 years old while watching this. What would he write if you were in the city after not getting proper service, and what would he write if you were outside? As AK Party, we have saved our cities from these problems with urban transformation projects and on-site transformation projects. Kotra is changing now, it needs to be better. We have started and are carrying out this transformation without victimizing any of our entitled citizens, on the contrary, with models that will benefit all of them. Of course, there may be sporadic negative examples. However, in general, we can say that this project satisfies all parties.
Some of the places where our Roma citizens live have also been included in these projects. Changing conditions and environment affect our Roma. The important thing is to adapt to new conditions by preserving that purity, cleanliness, human love, joy and affection in your soul. When you lose the qualities that make you who you are, you get lost in the crowd. However, my Lord has created each of His servants with the same characteristics, the same abilities and the same beauties. Of course, our Roma brothers and sisters will receive better education, of course they will receive better health care, of course they will find jobs more easily, of course they will live in better conditions. But he will never give up the charm of being a Roma.
As soon as you achieve this, you will have the opportunity to continue your existence as one of the most beautiful, unique and cheerful colors of Turkey. Are you performing music, do the best. Are you dealing with handicrafts, produce the most beautiful. Are you engaged in trade, put forward the best one. That's when you will see that the difficulties, troubles and prejudices in front of you are destroyed one by one. All the institutions of our state, starting with myself as the President, are with you in your struggle. You will make an effort so that the plans, programs and arrangements made will reach a concrete result.
Brothers;
If I know a little bit about the Roma, which I believe you are, and I have a lot of friends among you, I believe that you have the ability to do it. As long as you take that first step, put forward that first will, believe me, the rest is much easier.
Brothers;
Over the past 15 years, Turkey's journey towards democracy and development has reached higher levels than ever before. Like every journey, we are constantly confronted with stumbling blocks, traps and games in our struggle for development and democracy. This picture is much better understood when we look at what our country has been going through since November 2002, when we came to power, like a film strip.
If you ask me what is Turkey's biggest achievement in this process, the answer I will give you is that we have achieved our independence in the real sense. Oh, you will say, wasn't Turkey already independent? On paper, maybe it was; But we were actually dependent on something in every field. We were dependent on a place in the defense industry, we could not buy every weapon we wanted. 'Go today and come back tomorrow, Congress won't let you.' If we had not produced our drones, the situation in Afrin, in Operation Euphrates Shield, would have been different today. ""When I was going in, I got the latest numbers and asked, 'What is the situation in Afrin?' The situation in Afrin is the latest 4108 terrorists have been neutralized. We neutralized 338 terrorists in northern Iraq. We neutralized 173 terrorists in the country. In Gabar, Cudi, TendÃ¼rek, and Beslardaresi, we descended to their hills and entered their lairs.
Did we have the chance to make decisions and implement practices independent of the IMF and financial institutions that have a say in the economy around the world? Didn't. But we came into office, we owed 23.5 billion dollars to the IMF, we paid all the debts in 2013, and now we are not dependent on the IMF. This is the AK Party's rule. Did we have the chance to determine and implement our security policies independently of certain institutions and countries? Didn't. Did we have the opportunity to formulate and implement our own priorities in our foreign policy? Weren't. In short, we were faced with a Turkey whose will to make and implement decisions on every issue was minimized. Because there was a weakness in our democracy and economy.
By strengthening both, we have started a brand new era in front of our country. A country with a national income of $236 billion has now become a country with $860 billion; from where to where. Can you imagine, a country with an export of 36 billion dollars a year, now a country with an export of 160 billion dollars... And a country that invests 70 billion liras a year is now a country that invests 266 billion liras; from where to where... The number of employees is 20 million, now the number of employees is 28 million; from where to where...
With a country that surrendered to coups and juntas; Is it possible to look at a country that stands like a lion against the coup plotters and junta with you and repells them before morning? We expelled FETÃ in 16 hours. Now we are chasing, they are running away, we are chasing. Here we came from Kosovo with 6 of them. We bought 3 of them from Gabon and came. Wherever you go, we have brought 80 of them so far and we will continue to do so.
Dear brothers and sisters;
They are playing games on the economy, the Gezi protests and so on. We have frustrated all of these games, and we will continue to do so. And the main thing is, this heart that I see in you. Although my Roma brothers and sisters have not had any money in their pockets, they have been fighting for their lives in this country for centuries with the strength of their hearts. Alhamdulillah, there is a heart like a barbecue in our nation. From here, I call out to those who attack our economy; You won't succeed. Just as you failed in Syria and Iraq on July 15 in your previous games, you will not succeed now.
Brothers;
With these feelings, I once again offer my love and respect to you, my dear Roma brothers and sisters. I entrust you all to God.

Their speech at the groundbreaking ceremony of Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant,2018-04-03,"

Mr. President, my dear friend,
Honourable members of the committee,
Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen;
I greet you with my heartfelt feelings and respect. First of all, I would like to welcome my dear friend Mr. Putin, President of the Russian Federation, and the members of the delegation to our country.
Today, we are witnessing a truly historic moment both for the development of our country and for our energy cooperation with the Russian Federation. I am fortunate to lay the foundation of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant here today with my dear friend Putin. I would like to express my gratitude to him and the esteemed members of the delegation for sharing our excitement on this meaningful day.
The great progress that our countries have made in bilateral relations, especially in the last 15 years, is a very important reference for our future. The High-Level Cooperation Council, whose seventh meeting we will hold today, has become a symbol of the level of our relations. In addition, together with the Russian Federation, we are implementing many strategic projects. The S-400 air defense systems, the Turkish Stream Natural Gas Pipeline, and the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, the foundation of which we will lay now, are just a few of them. In addition, our countries are in close cooperation to end the terrorist threat and conflicts in Syria as soon as possible.
Dear friends;
As Turkey, we grew by an average of 5.8 percent between 2003 and 2017. In 2017, we achieved a growth rate of 7.4 percent. We aim to be one of the 10 largest economies in the world in 2023, the 100th anniversary of our Republic. This means that our need for energy is also increasing.
In the last 15 years, we have implemented projects that could not even be dreamed of before, both in oil and natural gas and renewable resources. In line with the goal of improving our energy security, our investments in all areas of our energy sector continue uninterruptedly. Nuclear energy has an important place in our plans for a future where our country will have safe and sustainable energy.
Currently, 31 countries in the world obtain a significant part of their electricity from 450 nuclear power plants in operation. Currently, 55 nuclear power plants are under construction in 16 countries. With Akkuyu, the foundation of which we have laid today, this number becomes 56. With the commissioning of the first reactor of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in 2023, Turkey will also be included in the family that uses nuclear energy. Thus, we will crown the 100th anniversary of the establishment of our Republic with a historical work in the field of energy.
When Akkuyu is commissioned with all its units, it will be able to meet 10 percent of our country's electricity needs, as mentioned earlier. Thus, we will make our energy basket, which is still predominantly based on oil, natural gas and coal, healthier. Nuclear power plants that do not emit carbon dioxide are a clean energy source. Therefore, this power plant will play an important role in the fight against climate change while contributing to our energy security.
This experience will also make a significant contribution to the training of our human resources, who are competent in the field of nuclear energy and have a say on an international scale. As a matter of fact, hundreds of our young people are currently studying nuclear energy at universities in Russia. Hopefully, these young people will return to our country after completing their education and undertake important duties.
Dear friends;
Like many of Turkey's investments and many works, we have been fortunate to realize the Akkuyu Project, which has been our country's dream for half a century. From the moment we decided on the Akkuyu Project, we have worked very closely with all Russian authorities, especially Mr. Putin, at the political and technical level. They have shown a truly admirable cooperation up to this stage. The reason why we have made progress in such a complex issue in a short time; It is the spirit of cooperation that the two sides have demonstrated throughout the process. For this, I would like to thank all Russian officials, especially my friend Putin.
Likewise, I would like to thank our Prime Minister, the Speaker and deputies of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for their support in this process, and all of them for my previous Energy Ministers. Of course, I would like to convey my congratulations to our Minister of Energy and Natural Resources and our officials from all levels, who have implemented this project by working day and night.
We will continue to work together in line with our goal of commissioning the first reactor of this power plant, which will consist of four reactors, by 2023. Likewise, we are determined to continue our cooperation with Russia on regional issues by increasing day by day.
With these thoughts, I hope that the construction of this facility, the foundation of which we will lay, will be concluded as soon as possible and that it will be auspicious for our countries. I offer you my love and respect. Stay healthy.

Dear Friend Mr. President Pahor,
First of all, I would like to thank you very much for the interest and interest you have shown to me and my delegation since the moment we arrived.
On behalf of myself and my delegation, I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings.
I am in your country at the invitation of the President of Slovenia, a friend and ally. I visited Slovenia in May 2012 as Prime Minister, and during that visit, my friend Pahor, who was also the President, signed the Strategic Council Agreement at that time. And we had the opportunity to meet again with my esteemed counterpart, President Pahor during his visit to our country in January 2014.  By the way, of course, we met in New York, we had meetings there.  Of course, these high-level visits continue to increase, and these are a sign that these relations between Turkey and Slovenia are increasing by strengthening in the military field as well as in the economic and commercial fields. And in the political sphere, there is no problem between Slovenia and Turkey so far.
In addition, there is a Slovenia that has always been with us in the European Union process, and we have given our strong support to them in NATO. Of course, above all, 1991 is the year of Slovenia's independence, in 1992 we, as Turkey, recognized the independence of Slovenia, and in April 1993 we opened our embassy in Slovenia, all of these are expressions of determination.
In the economic field, as my dear friend Pahor has just stated, we have a trade volume of over 1 billion dollars; Of course, we do not find this figure sufficient, we will increase them even more. But besides that, we are taking new steps, in third countries, for example, they themselves have expressed it, and we want to throw this man out with the support that will be given as Turk Eximbank to establish a hydroelectric power plant at the energy point in Montenegro, including Turkey, Slovenia and Montenegro, and our energy ministers are in contact with us on this issue. Again, we will take these steps in many areas, whether in natural gas or renewable energy.
Of course, another important step is that we have the opportunity to take joint steps in the contracting sector, it is possible to take these steps in the same way in the automotive sector and in the same way in textiles. And when we say Turkey-Slovenia, we departed from Istanbul this morning and we are here in 2 hours, these are no longer distant countries for us, we have the opportunity to be together as close countries.  Our Joint Economic Commission and commissions came together a short time ago, they had the opportunity to discuss what we can do together, and what we can do jointly in the Western Balkans, we discussed them in our bilateral meeting, we evaluated them. We had the opportunity to discuss issues in a much broader way between the delegations.
Of course, the issue we insist on here is the implementation of these two agreements that we have signed today and it is very important that we make rapid progress, which we do not find sufficient, they need to increase even more, and we have demonstrated our determination on this issue at the point of leaders. In the next period, it is really our desire to continue this process by accelerating, especially by bringing together our ministers and deputies.
One of our important demands is; In particular, this is an issue related to the increase of driver's licenses in transportation, and the more we can increase them, I believe that we will come to a very different position in trade in these relations in Europe.
There is a good development in tourism, more than 40 thousand Slovenian tourists have come to Turkey. But in the same way, there is an increase in tourists coming to Slovenia from Turkey. And another issue; Currently, one flight from Turkish Airlines comes to Slovenia from Ljubljana every day of the week, and of course, we have taken a step to increase this number to 10. And in this regard, these developments show that the cohesion between the people of Slovenia and the people of Turkey will rise to a much more serious position with tourism.
I would like to thank my dear friend Pahor again for this meeting and we look forward to seeing him as soon as possible. Of course, my first invitation, now 24 April, 23-24 April, in fact, they will make a choice there and we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the land battles in Ãanakkale and I invited them there, I am waiting for them there. At the moment, more than 30 heads of state and government have announced that they will come, and I want to see them there, God willing, and give a message of peace to the world together.

I was very impressed with the faculty as I see it now. I believe that you, our dear students, will be the home of knowledge for the future with a much different self-confidence in this faculty.
Knowledge without wisdom has no meaning, and knowledge without wisdom has no meaning. I believe that such students will be trained from Sani KonukoÄlu Faculty of Theology.
And as you know, after February 28, which was commemorated and saddened in many places last week, the number of students in imam hatips in this country fell to 60 thousand. At that time, it was a sadness for us, of course, for the President of an imam hatip, who had 4 children with imam hatip, for us at that time. And it was a time of getting stuck in the coefficient barrier. At the moment, I praise our Lord, the number of students has reached 1 million, from 60 thousand to 1 million. This shows one thing; This is a matter of demand, which means that there was a hunger in our citizens in this country in this regard, and when the opportunity and ground were prepared, they sent their children to vocational high schools and imams.
Now, of course, we have a deficit here, my Minister of National Education is here, my President of Religious Affairs is here, our Rector, Dean, teachers are here, and we have a shortage of teachers in imam hatips. We need to eliminate this deficit. For this reason, we will need quality, well-trained and well-equipped teachers like you.
Of course, this is not enough, as you know, we want to train our undergraduate students in a much stronger way by sending them abroad. At the point of graduate and doctorate, both YÃK support and government support, these continue to increase. But in addition to this, of course, foundation support continues. One of these foundations is the foundation services of the KonukoÄlu Family in Gaziantep, and they have really great efforts at this point.
Now, I would like to thank the KonukoÄlu Family, who are the founders of the Sani KonukoÄlu Faculty of Theology, Mr. AbdÃ¼lkadir and his brothers in your presence. God bless them. Of course, don't stop, keep going. They have not stopped until today, they have made their investments, and I believe that they will continue like this in the future.
I would like to thank them very much in your presence.

Receiving a delegation of temporary village guards
Dear Friends,
I greet you all with love and respect. Welcome to the Presidential Palace, the palace of the nation.
At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to congratulate our Government, the Turkish Armed Forces, and all our security forces who participated in and supported the operation to evacuate the Suleiman Shah Tomb and the Police Station, which was successfully carried out the previous night.
The Tomb of Suleiman Shah is a trust of our ancestors and history. Â Until today, we have meticulously protected this trust.
Previously, the location of the shrine had been changed twice. This was the third change. These concentrations were due to the dams built. This time, due to extraordinary security conditions, the tomb was transferred to a safer place. As you know, there are very tough conflicts in the region. The justification for the operation is strong, and its execution has been carried out successfully.Â  This is never a retreat, a renunciation of the trust of our ancestors and history.
The work done is only a temporary way, a temporary transportation process that we resort to in order not to endanger the life safety of our soldiers who are in charge of protecting the tomb.
With this relocation, Turkey has not waived or waived any of its rights arising from the agreements. In the same way, our land exists within the borders of Syria. The area where the transfer is currently being made has been taken under protection by our soldiers in the same way.
For now, the safety of our soldiers in charge of protecting the tomb is paramount for us.
Undoubtedly, the preservation of the tomb and the relics in accordance with its spiritual values is very important for us.
With this move, we have also disrupted the schemes of those who want to use the Tomb of Suleiman Shah and our soldiers there as a means of blackmail against us. While we are disrupting these games, it is really sad and thought-provoking that some circles inside the country are making accusations against their own states and governments with very harsh expressions. In particular, it is regrettable that the opposition parties have come into line with the Assad regime on this issue.
It is a pity that those who did not see a problem in the transfer of the tomb due to the construction of the dam in 1939 and 1975 slammed the transfer operation in 2015 for a much more important and vital reason.
As it is known, the tomb was moved to the area of EÅme Village, just 200 meters from our border, also on Syrian soil. Our flag is now flying in the EÅme region.
During the transport operation, one of our non-commissioned officers was martyred as a result of an accident. Here, once again, I wish the mercy of Allah Almighty on our martyr and my condolences to his comrades-in-arms and family.
Turkey has carried out such operations many times in the past. We are also well aware of the reactions of those who reacted to the transfer of the Suleiman Shah Tomb to the storming of our Consulate General in Mosul and the hostage taking of our employees there. Of course, I would like to say that we remember this very well. Later, with a careful planning and a successful operation, we rescued our Consulate General employees safely and brought them to our country without anyone's nose bleeding. At the moment, in this current operation, it is not a week or a month, we have been working on it together with our relevant units, our Armed Forces, for months. The plan was carried out with great will, the hour came, the moment came, and this result was achieved by carrying it out.
In the same way, during the events in Libya, we successfully evacuated thousands of our citizens who were there, even citizens of other countries. Turkey is a country that can make its own decisions, take initiative and carry out its own operations in such crisis situations. We should all be proud of this.
Those who want to create a negative atmosphere about this operation have no intention of protecting the interests of Turkey and our nation. Â Our nation has not given a premium to those who want to gain political results from national issues, and it will not do so in this issue.
I once again congratulate our Government and the Turkish Armed Forces, who have successfully carried out the transfer of the Suleiman Shah Tomb, and I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to this operation on behalf of my country and nation.
Dear Friends,
We are here today with a delegation representing our Temporary Village Guards. Once again, I welcome them to the home of the nation.
As it is known, the Temporary Village Guard system has been going on since 1985. This system is important in that it is also an expression of the people of the region standing by their state and nation against the terrorist organization. Our Temporary Village Guards, which were organized to protect their own villages against the attacks of the separatist terrorist organization and to ensure the security of their own lives and property, later became the biggest helper of our security forces in the region.
The sacrifices of our Temporary Village Guards, who have lost 1,620 martyrs so far in their counter-terrorism activities, are above all appreciation. Currently, 45,880 Temporary Village Guards are working in 22 provinces.
In 2007, 2012 and 2013, we made very important arrangements to eliminate the grievances of our Temporary Village Guards regarding their personal rights. Today, we will discuss, talk and discuss all these issues with them.
I would like to express my gratitude to all our Temporary Village Guards who have taken part in the protection of their families, villages, regions and countries. I wish God's mercy on our martyrs and condolences to their relatives. I wish success to all our Temporary Village Guards who are still on duty, and I wish God to help them.
On this occasion, I would like to express to you that we will once again convene our Council of Ministers at the Presidential Palace on March 9. In these important days of our country, we will make comprehensive evaluations with our Government and members of the Council of Ministers, both to reveal the current situation and to review the preparations for the future.

Mr. President,
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Gentlemen
I greet you with the most heartfelt feelings at this emotional, emotional as well as meaningful meeting.
I say emotional and meaningful, because in the election held on August 10 in Turkey, where the people elected the President, as always, by making my first visit to the TRNC, we are starting the official diplomatic relations process of our journey from Northern Cyprus. Because the more meaningful it is for the mother and the baby to meet, the more meaningful it is for us to meet here.
Tomorrow, God willing, we have a trip to Azerbaijan. We will go to Azerbaijan. Again, this is our duty, which we have always fulfilled in this way for years, both in the elections of our presidents and in the election of our prime ministers.
Now, in the meetings we will hold with Mr. President, the leader of the main opposition, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Members of the Council of Ministers, we will once again discuss the place of Northern Cyprus' sincere and upright stance in the international community.
Of course, we have the NATO Summit next week and the UN General Assembly at the end of the month. Cyprus is also an important item on our agenda in these meetings. I would like to thank you for this interest, this kindness; I would like to thank you very much on behalf of myself and my nation.
I want you to know this: We can never forget Northern Cyprus. And I hope that within two months, the water from Turkey, under the sea, will reach Northern Cyprus. Now the dams are already done, that job is done. Now, God willing, the water is reaching. Hopefully, together with the water, and then â we have discussed them before, we will continue to meet them again â I hope that electricity from under the sea will also reach here from under the sea. And here, I hope there will be no such thing as occasional interruptions or anything like that.
And let me also say this: When Southern Cyprus needs it, I believe that they will receive the message of peace from the steps we have taken.
Of course, our desire here is this: Greece should do this duty in the same way as Turkey, especially as guarantor countries. If these tasks are fulfilled, I believe that the Cyprus problem will be resolved in a very short time.
I greet you all with these feelings.
Happy day, may our future be bright, God willing.
