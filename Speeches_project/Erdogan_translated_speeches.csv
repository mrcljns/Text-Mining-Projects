Dear young people,
Valuable guests; for Mehmet Akif ‘hayat is a poem much more spectacular than his works’ says. His life, like his works, is full of lessons, examples, inspirations for us. Mehmet Akif, who lives a genuine, genuine, sincere life, is essentially a mercy
poet. While living in great poverty, he donated the 500-pound prize money of the Istiklal Anthem, which he wrote by trembling from the cold, to the Darul Mesai Foundation, which teaches embroidery to poor women and children. Along with his poems his ideas and his whole life
he is a man of lawsuits committed to the nation. During the War of Independence, the city with its friend, fellow traveller Ashraf Edip, traveled through the town with his sermons, and with his writings, burned the fire of independence and brought life to the spirit of Kuvayi Milliye.
He is a teacher of Darulfide who has taught at Istanbul University Faculty of Literature. He is an Islamic scholar who knows Arabic, Persian and French very well and is a foundation in religious sciences at the same time. A light that sheds light on the nation with its writings in the Journal of Serat-I-Legister
heir. However, do you know how many cents were in the pocket of Akif when he set out towards Anatolia? 36 Cents. Because it is a strange thing that the trouble, the freckle, the responsibility, has ripened at a very young age.
The land in which he was born is now outside the borders of his homeland, where he feels himself belonging to his whole being. A 600-year-old Jihan State was torn apart before his eyes, and our last remaining land was occupied in Anatolia. This is why Mehmet Akif Istiklal
Our war is surrounded by four hands. Anatolia also worried that if the doors of hope of the ummah would be closed completely.In her poem Terrified, 1918, see what she said:
“Cihan turned upside down, you looked at the course, and you stood like that,
Today you are a bum, you worry in your own country!
Life is of course right... But the meat is shouting and shouting;
Deaf domes hear a voice: Da'i Hesak.
And these billions of moons are mountains, vast;
Who listens to a person who sits and cries?”
Yes, Mehmet Akif preferred to be a lawsuit man who struggled instead of being a crying underdog. However, he could not avoid being attacked by his new state, which he wrote the Istiklal Anthem, and becoming a refugee.
His days in Egypt, where he lived for 11 years as an exile, were spent with illness, poverty, lack of money and, most painfully, with the harvest of the homeland. In the end, he was able to attain his homeland; but like his life, his death was sad. The participation of the state power in the funeral prayer in the world
he is perhaps the only national poet to be banned.
See how a college student who witnessed that bitter day describes the landscape: “Biz, a few students were waiting for the funeral of Akifin to come to the Beyazit Mosque. After a while, a funeral car approached. Download a coffin with no cover on two people
was working. A few college students waiting for the funeral of Akifin in the mosque courtyard also wanted to help the coffin become poor and disguised. As he approached the funeral, the students, who understood that the coffin belonged to Mehmet Akifuete, began to cry. Of them
someone ran to the hustle and took the flag of the nearby restaurant and covered it on the coffin of the motherland poet. In a short time until the time of prayer, hundreds of university students flocked to the funeral of Akifabin. The coffin of the motherland poet is on the shoulders of the university youth
adirnekapi Martyrdom with Monopolies.” Unfortunately, this is how Mehmet Akif made his last trip.
Dear young people;
Look at what has happened in the history of this nation. Think about it, no one from the state power can come to an independent poet, to say goodbye at his death. Where have we gone, where are we now.
Mehmet Akif was first and foremost a lover of direction and direction. Mehmet Akif, an idea worker, who was in a sweaty way to raise Asim's Generation, fought for it throughout his life. His only hope was you, youth. To his eternal resting place
he went on the shoulder of those young people to whom he devoted his life. The youth he dreamed of was not a youth who looked at the nation from the minaret of the Fatih Mosque before he went to Paris, and as for the Eiffel Tower, that is, alienated from himself and his values. For him, young people, Edirnekapi
Do not neglect your martyrdom, stop by and say, Mehmet Akif there, no, and be arrogant.
Here he sought a youth who possessed history, civilization and culture, and consolidated this accumulation with the science, knowledge, technique of the west. It has just been read with decency, this youth, “I can not applaud the soul, I can never love the oppressor. Gelen
the elder brother of courage, who stood up and said I cannot glorify the past for his enjoyment, was a youth. This generation was a youth who both drank from their own springs of knowledge and brought and used it wherever there was new, useful and prosperous.
Again in his own expression he dreamed of a generation‘ with such sharp consciousness that he would not throw ’eski because he was old, and he would not buy the new one because he was new. Mehmet Akif believed that education and knowledge were what would lead society toward truth, good and right.
Its purpose was; to fill the dried and dried springs of society with knowledge, knowledge and wisdom. For this, he saw education in the same occupation as the Canakkale struggle, at the same value. In his eyes, Asim's Generation is the struggle of this nation for independence with knowledge, knowledge, wisdom
you are a generation that will sustain, crown the Dardanelles with real victory.
Mehmet Akifabetin Asim  ⁇ ; merhum Cemil Mericin “Haluk is a genus name, the name of those who escape history is the opposite of the alienated, spirit-rooted young intellectual type he calls ”. Our last 200 years of politics, culture and art, actually Tevfik Fikretin Haluku
mehmet Akifabetin is the history of the struggle of Asim.
On one side there are the indigenous and the national, on the other there are those who think that the imitation of certain prisoners is to be enlightened, there are travelers. On the one hand there are those who serve this nation, on the other there are those who disdain the nation. On one side ‘Publicity
there are those who say Millindir’ and there are guardians who do not accept the nation on the other side. On the one hand, there are those who are veering for the future of the young people of this country, and on the other, those who are sacrificing young people to their blind ideology.
Here is what is happening in the Southeast, in the East, the weaves that are knitted there for our young people... On one side there are the bests and zippers, on the other side there are those who burn and wash. Those who struggle for rights, justice and freedom for all on one side, and only on the other
they have their own groups, those who work for their own interests. All of this, how familiar do young people seem to you, right? In today's Turkey, the same struggle continues in the same ranks.
Dear young people,
We have been fighting for the last 13 years to raise a useful generation for this country and to raise the generation of the Asim. We are fighting for all 78 million of them. We are not willing for any young people of this country to be wasted, to lose.
You saw it on television screens yesterday, they're setting a cultural center on fire in the Southeast. We have young children in it. They could have been burned to death. By the grace of my Lord they were saved. They burned schools, and in these schools, our offspring
could've gone. They burned our mosques, they still burned them. And when it comes to words, they take the word peace without being ashamed or bored, not at all, in their mouths. And now they are talking about dividing and dividing our lands in this country.
Young people, you don't need to be sad. With the permission of Allah, we will never allow any operation, any surgery, any kata in this country, know this, never and kataa. Because we have grown up with this decency: ‘flags on top of the flag
kandir, if the land died for the sake of the land, we grew up saying ’ is the homeland. We called Rabia for it; we said one nation, we said one flag, we said one homeland, we said one state; we walked like that.
We are 78 million single people; 78 million with Turkish, Kurdish, Laz, Circassian, Georgian, Arab, Bosnian, Roman. Because we loved the Creator because of the creation.
We said a single flag. The color of our flag, young people you know, the blood of our martyr. The crescent is the expression of our independence. The star is our martyr.
And then the homeland lands, with 780 thousand square kilometers, this homeland is the homeland territory of the Republic of Turkey. Young people, you won't forget: We won't be erected, but we'll stand tall, we'll never forget.
And the fourth is a single state; another state within the State of the Republic of Turkey can never be allowed. Young people, this nation has suffered a lot in the past. This country has sacrificed its most valuable capital, that is, to incitement, provocations, dirty accounts of its young people.
For a time, the young people of this country shot each other as the right-left. Unfortunately, some of the deceived young people of this country were used like a pawn in the streets and squares, as in the Gezi events. Thousands of young people from the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia of this country, Kandilde
in the established human market was spent on the intention of coinage. In the same way, the children of our citizens who went abroad after their bread, those who broke away from the lowest ones, were the ones who lost.
Today, they are attacking the young people who pray in METU. And I call from here: The rulers, when they speak, say we are libertarians, what is your libertarian? Unfortunately, these are the immunity armor they put in their hands
they are trying to use this kind of denial. Nothing like that happens, it can't be. Anyway, this should also be done by the PPP. And of course, as the presidential office, we will be followers of this as well. But these are never management
they can't say we're libertarians.
In the same way, in Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia, many of our children, young people, our children are lost in a fight that never happened to them. However, we, like Mehmet Akif, are trained with studded sticks in their hands, who pray
not attacking; we want to see a generation of Asim's youth, not attacking his own people, with the molotov in his hand, the kalechnikofla, the rocket launcher.
I express this at every opportunity: It is always a wealth for us that our young people are different, that they are from different opinions of the world. The greatest treasure of this country is freely the views of our young people in university courses, in their amphitheaters, in their classrooms
he can express, he can discuss. A person without an idea takes refuge in violence. I see it as the poor who resort to this path because they have no ideas of violent practitioners in universities and on the streets.
In this case, the other person ceases to be a teenager, to be a university student, to be oppressed, and becomes only a criminal. My heart is never content with such a view. The young people in our universities and behind the ditches
i wish to become as soon as possible useful individuals for themselves, their families, our nation and humanity.
By the way, yes, I remind the municipalities of the region again, I said a lot and I remind you again: Stop digging such ditches, too, please serve my Kurdish brothers, whom you claim to be representatives of, with the business machines of that municipality.
Gather their rubbish, please take their water into the homes of those Kurdish brothers who do not have water, and make the sewers that will carry their wastewater. Are these ones? Absent. Today in those counties, the sewers unfortunately flow openly. My Kurdish brothers
the real persecution is this team that says it represents them.
My precious brothers;
Of course, it is difficult to be the intellectual, writer and artist of a country that has been at the center of civilization for a long time. This is especially a thank you who acts with a mission of owning him at a time when he is being pushed, accrued, as old as Turkey
it's much harder for. Mehmet Akif has endured this heavy burden throughout his life. “No, there is no dream my shopping. Believe me, whatever I said, I saw and said ” How his life, infuriated by ordeal, by struggle, sometimes by exiles, preceded us
if it has been an example to generations and us, I hope it will guide future generations.
We are a nation that walks to the future with the lesson, inspiration, love and faith we have taken from our past just as Mehmet Akif has longed. Hamdolsun, this is the view I have seen in front of me that the saplings that the bloodshed in the Canakkalee, Anatolia, are standing on the fruit today
it points. The enthusiasm in front of me shows that Assim's Generation is a truth, not a dream.
On February 28, on February 28, there were 600 thousand students in Imam Hatip High School. We came to power, this number of students had decreased to 60 thousand, but now there are 1 million 200 thousand students. Yes, what do those beauties say in the beautiful statement: “Men sabera zafera; patient person, nobody
reaches victory.” We were patient, but in the end it was victory. I hope that the future is 2053 Turkey, we will not see it, but I hope, I pray that this generation will see, hope or those who see will come out. 2071 I hope you and your children and grandchildren
together you will build.
As I put an end to my words with these thoughts, I once again confess with respect to our poet, the great cause and man of struggle, Mehmet Akif Ersoyu. Master Necip Fazil I denounce the pity of pity. And again, eternal glorification from those seven beautiful men
i praise those who have done so with mercy.
I wholeheartedly thank everyone who organized this beautiful organization and brought us together.
I offer you my love and respect. With thick health."
